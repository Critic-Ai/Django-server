Here\u2019s how it works.Demanding but excellent combat and gorgeous visuals sit awkwardly in a half-baked roguelike structure.

Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.\u00a0What is it? A roguelike third-person shooter with a strong bullet hell lineage.\u00a0Expect to pay: \u00a350 / $60Developer: HousemarquePublisher: PlayStation PC\u00a0Reviewed on: 64-bit Windows 10, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, 32GB RAMMultiplayer: Co-op onlyLink: Steam pageIn 1996, Housemarque released Super Stardust, and for two decades it honed the top down arcade shooter. In 2017, it declared \"ARCADE IS DEAD\"\u2014there was no money left in it, and the developer would be \"moving on to new genres\". Returnal is the result, a big budget roguelike that kicks off a new era for the studio. The twist? It's\u2026 basically an arcade shooter.Okay, that's a little unfair. Strictly speaking, it's a third-person roguelike shooter\u2014the camera tight over your shoulder, not high above, with runs progressing you through a shifting alien world, rather than being an opportunity to chase high scores. But the more you play, the more it feels like a wolf in sheep's clothing, using some of the trappings of a popular modern genre to smuggle in the gameplay Housemarque is more known for. It's a game with one foot in the studio's past and another in its future\u2014and, despite the game's strengths, that's not always a comfortable position to stand in.Things kick off with an astronaut\u2014Selene\u2014crash-landing on the alien planet of Atropos. After some fraught encounters with the hostile wildlife, she discovers she's trapped in a time loop\u2014if she dies, she simply wakes up again at the crash site. And not only that, but she's been trapped for a lot longer than she remembers, a fact chillingly proved by the frequent discoveries of her own past corpses, complete with audio logs full of the crazed ramblings of her past lives. It's a perfect narrative set-up for a roguelike, contextualising your repeated runs through Atropos' dangerous levels as part of a continuous story\u2014similar to Deathloop or particularly Hades.Each run consists of a series of rooms\u2014some containing loot, secrets and traps, but most bursting with furious enemies. Combat is fast, frantic and deadly, a furious, leaping dance of aliens and projectiles. Survival means always being on the move, sprinting and dashing as you get your shots in while you can, and avoiding getting hit at all costs so you can maintain your vital Adrenaline\u2014a stacking buff that vanishes if you lose any health.\u00a0It's exhilarating stuff, chaotic enough to always keep your blood pumping, but precise enough to demand mastery. And more than just showing Housemarque's strengths as a studio with a long history of skill-based games, it specifically evokes arcade shooters. Projectiles are big and slow-moving, but frequently fill the screen\u2014it very much feels like a third-person take on bullet hell as you weave between shots. Alt-fire modes on your guns feel like arcade power-ups, launching waves of shots or blazing beams.\u00a0Even the visuals evoke a meeting of two worlds. The alien landscape is beautifully bleak and weird, a foreboding realm whose techno-organic creatures and machines take clear inspiration from the Alien films and the art of HR Giger. But against that quiet, creepy backdrop, combat is an explosion of noise and light, a barrage of neon bullets and blasts straight out of Super Stardust. Even two years on from Returnal's original launch on PS5, the combination is visually stunning, and, importantly, runs smooth as butter. No matter how busy things got on screen\u2014and trust me, they got extremely busy\u2014I was always hitting a consistent 60FPS even at max settings. Just what you want for a game this focused on fast, precise action.\u00a0Elsewhere, unfortunately, the game struggles to find a similar balance. Despite the roguelike structure, there's a clear reluctance to let the RPG elements traditional for the genre have too much effect on the very skill-based combat. There's almost no persistent progression, and even within a run, boons that you earn frequently feel minor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0340d9e2-8df5-4d70-a9e9-144219d88692": {"__data__": {"id_": "0340d9e2-8df5-4d70-a9e9-144219d88692", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d087c29-fdca-4b74-8a44-3754297dd8ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0005d4d2c4f774fe9598b7bccedfde50b771a61d9c43bfba186d71ac9e79685"}, "3": {"node_id": "0625a5b0-0c80-40ae-bd0b-c5601bf43e07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f215d13f6c9c534b9bcb5cd9fb72fa26cc8d2502f05f6d0bbfd27457d176b0ff"}}, "hash": "38a1cb180574787895d4a1503695d305579b027573780cf526d91569ac0161a6", "text": "Combined with the long length of runs, the result is that it's very possible to die after 40 minutes of play having made no progress at all in your overall goal. It often feels like the best strategy is to simply rush to your goal as fast as possible, rather than taking time to explore and search for loot.\u00a0Runs are full of risk/reward decisions\u2014should you open this chest, knowing it might give you a debuff? Should you enter this challenge room, attempting a tough fight for extra rewards? Should you brave that dangerous trap to get the health pick-up inside? The problem is, because of that focus on skill over RPG progression, the rewards are usually meagre, and the risk is often too harsh. Combat is so difficult and punishing that the wrong debuff or too much damage taken ahead of an encounter can easily tank a run no matter how far in you are. It's simply not worth rolling the dice on that for the sake of a slight increase to your health (in a game that demands you simply never get hit anyway), one of many incrementally better guns, or one of the artifact buffs that, due to their specificity, I found often never came into play at all.\u00a0It's particularly grating once you reach one of the game's bosses. Each one is a glorious bullet hell fever dream, and beating them necessitates learning their attacks and practicing the appropriate dodges and counters, often with lots of trial and error. During an attempt it's a blast, but the roguelike structure means it can take hours between each go, as you fight your way to their room, try to keep yourself at high enough health to have a chance, stock up on consumables you'll need, search for a decent weapon\u2026 After all that, you could still die in a few hits, and be right back at square one.\u00a0I have to stress\u2014in the moment, when you're bouncing between platforms, blasting aliens and dashing through their attacks, it looks and feels excellent. It's some of the best and most engaging action you'll find on PC. But it feels like that need to present it as something other than a pure test of twitch reflexes has led to it being housed in totally the wrong structure. There's a real sense that, though the developer perfectly understands how to stage a fight, it really doesn't get what makes people love roguelikes\u2014and certainly never figured out how to make that gel with what people love about arcade shooters.The result is a game that, though frequently fun and hugely satisfying to conquer, also demands far more patience than is really fair to ask. Even the story, despite that promising start and some wonderfully thick horror atmosphere, ends up being a frustratingly vague tapestry that feels more aimed at the creators of 20 minute YouTube explainers than the average player. A certain breed of dedicated gaming masochist will revel in Returnal's lengthy and unwavering challenge, but I suspect most will either wish there was more meaningful RPG progression, or that it was simply a series of score-attack levels without all that roguelike padding in between.\u00a0The irony is that the game's post-release DLC, bundled in free with the PC port, offers a glimpse at what could have been. The Tower of Sisyphus is an endless survival challenge that simply warps you from room to room for brief but frantic fights. Rewards come thick and fast, a high score system gives you a new reason to hone your skills, and runs are quick and satisfying. It gets right to the meat of what the game is good at, and I found myself wishing it had been the template for the whole game, instead of just a sideshow.\u00a0For better and worse, this is a game defined by Housemarque's struggle with its own identity. On the one hand, it's a frenzied shooter that brings to bear decades of arcade experience into a supremely satisfying and frequently beautiful experience. On the other, it's a half-hearted grab at a more popular genre that fails to understand what makes its fellow roguelikes work so well. If this truly is a new era for Housemarque, I can only hope its next project has a clearer vision of that future.\u00a0Demanding but excellent combat and gorgeous visuals sit awkwardly in a half-baked roguelike structure.

How do they behave? What role do you play in the relationship here, and what do they think of you in return? Normally this is quite easy. Think about it and you'll find games will happily fall into their roles - courthouse jester, self-serious actor, cerebral engineer (I'm not going to say which is which). But in this case it's been tricky. Returnal is hard to pin down. But pinned it down I have: Returnal has the personality of a furious cat with a sore tooth, and it's your job to be its vet. I'm saying this because Returnal is good - it's so good! - but it is incredibly reluctant to let you find that out. It hides its best moments, buries them, beneath repetition and frustration and a byzantine UI, but those moments are just extraordinary. Euphoric, even! It's in its interest and my own for it to just let me play it, but Returnal is a video game that does not want to be played.The history is going to be important here, if we're going to pull all of this apart. Returnal is the latest from Housemarque, the Finnish team behind masterly arcade-style shoot-em-ups like Resogun, twin-stick shooters like Dead Nation and Alienation, and the superlative Nex Machina. It's their first \"triple-A\" one though, and with big budget comes big scope. Returnal's is vast - it wants to be everything. It's a roguelite, insofar as death returns you to the start and the dungeonlike world procedurally changes with each run through it. But it's also a metroidvania, handing out new abilities after boss kills which open up new paths. And it's a third-person shooter, obviously. But also a bullet-hell arcade game. And a first-person narrative horror. And a soulslike. It picks from Ridley Scott, Eugene Jarvis, Hidetaka Miyazaki, H.R. Giger. From Metroid, P.T., Control. From Defender and Vanquish. Pick your poison - Returnal stocks everything and almost everything is sublime.Story first. Returnal's story - which I should warn you I haven't finished and probably never will, but more on that later - is fantastic, at least so far. And I say story in the widest possible terms, because Returnal's a rare case of a game that understands the unmatched breadth of what a game's story can be. The setup is you, Selene, crash on a deeply hostile planet called Atropos for an unknown reason, seemingly defying an order. The execution is through everything the game has. Selene is voiced with stern perfection by Jane Perry, (with likeness from Anne Beyer): cold, assertive, a scouting warrior-scientist who's first reaction is to catalogue and enquire, to talk to the monsters before shooting them to bits. Through her lens the world is all flora and fauna, but gradually that lens is smashed. She's chasing the \"white shadow\", a signal broadcast from somewhere on the planet that she is guided to, or lured toward, by the vision of a 20th century astronaut. This becomes her God of the Gaps, the thing that answers what science can't: why, for instance, each time Selene dies she wakes up, back at her crashed ship, back at the beginning of the trail, the end of which she assumes must be at that white shadow.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89d1c17a-ee7f-4528-a4fb-b699c8b04fae": {"__data__": {"id_": "89d1c17a-ee7f-4528-a4fb-b699c8b04fae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "0625a5b0-0c80-40ae-bd0b-c5601bf43e07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f215d13f6c9c534b9bcb5cd9fb72fa26cc8d2502f05f6d0bbfd27457d176b0ff"}, "3": {"node_id": "aaf1c53e-2416-4bdf-a63f-f5beb3975102", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "82fb855bcf3127bc4f140a470d132f4a075717ca19df929ac8884fd5f4299d9b"}}, "hash": "35b46d5343e4071214dc5f3435af5969cf5b4f8491105be9b97ac6afb5f5834b", "text": "There's a spooky house you visit along the way (where suddenly you're in first-person), there are audio logs of past and future dead Selenes, suffering varying levels of madness (there's a Dark Souls-y element to this: some found bodies mirror the deaths of other players, whom you can choose to \"salvage\" for resources or \"avenge\" with a mini boss fight) and there are xeno-archives to tour and xeno-runes to collect that offer varying dollops of a kind of space-Greek mythology. It's very Remedy, if we're doing references again - disquiet and implied horror, but never overt. (Which makes sense: Returnal shares talent with Remedy in narrative designers like Gregory Louden and Eevi Korhonen, and what talent they are).But again, this is really the beginning of what counts for story. It's also the mastery of the other things, the miscellaneous: the sounds of it, the squelching, dripping, gurning noise of the world that tells you it's rotten, putrid, old. It's the fog, the swirls of sand, the thick, polluted haze, the retro-future menus and computers - Returnal is always partially obscured, hard to read, half-intelligible. The use of quiet and echoed sound, robotic honks or gurgled growls through smog and forest, alien life that's dormant, but very much waiting to come alive (and subsequently pull you apart). The third biome, a long-dead, incomprehensibly vast robo-citadel, is a work of art, arguably the best sci-fi world I've visited in a game. Even the controller itself is in on it, clicking and rolling and crunching wonderfully in the hand, doing the whole \"first big exclusive on next gen\" thing by frankly just showing off. These are small things, but things that pull in the direction of the story, brushstrokes going in the same direction, and this stuff is hard, as is obvious from the rareness of such cohesion and the games that pull it off.What Returnal's going for with all this, and achieving, is a sense of hostility. A hostile planet, Selene's hostile thoughts, a place you do not want to be. It continues in the action, although the actual results here are mixed. Returnal has six \"biomes\", each with a boss at the end that blocks your progress to the next. Each biome is made up of a series of areas, almost rooms, which reshuffle each time you die and are linked by two kinds of door, a \"main path\" one that links to other main rooms and objectives, and a \"side path\" one that links to items or other \"discoveries\" (crucially, these are not always good, but again more on that later). In the first biome, a murky, midnight blue forest, all that can make navigating a little tricky; the map is fine, if not the clearest, the world is dark, if unproblematic on a fancy OLED with HDR and all the luxuries (I suspect this will be a recurring theme this generation), and in the early stages one room can blur into the next, at least until you've been through them all so many times that even the shortest stretches of connective tissue become committed to muscle memory.This is fine - it's all hellish ambiance and I'm all about that - but artful hostility starts to feel like actual hostility after a little while. Take checkpoints: did you know there are checkpoints? Well there are and there aren't. Returnal purposely avoids explaining things properly, and it takes pleasure in encouraging you to gamble on an unknown device and then punish you for doing so. So you might see a room with some kind of body-shaped alien device in that says something about restructuring biological thingymajigs, and that it has an extortionate Ether cost attached (Ether is an ultra-rare resource that is the only thing to carry over from one run to the next), and you might think, on your first lengthy run in a while, \"better not take the risk\" - or you might spend a fortune on it but be right near the start of the run, and realise it was a total waste, four or five hours of resources down the drain. Either way, once you do, you will discover something else: that checkpoints only work once per run, so you better be sure when you spend half a day's resources on one.Beyond that of course it's the action. This is not the same as other Housemarque games. In fact it's not really the same as anything. It's an odd hybrid. Selene's movement is slick, taught, poised, immaculately responsive.

Dashes, with infinite use and very low cooldowns, grant you i-frames - invincibility from anything - while weapons work via overheating rather than ammo. Enemies pump out waves of various orbs, with the odd laser, the odd rapid melee, the odd explosion, and they're fine, but the majority of combat doesn't really get above that. Guns are satisfying but they are all just guns, not getting distinct enough until you're about halfway through the game. Melee is satisfying but, beyond the odd damage boost or something similar, I haven't found anything exotic enough to call a functioning melee build. Builds in general feel less like builds and more a mess of blessings and curses, too randomly determined to push you to a particular style of play. The result is in the inbetween, the moments that make the bulk of your playtime, Returnal's combat is ever so slightly disappointing. It's a game of endurance, about keeping on the move and not making silly mistakes, scrounging around for scraps of health or a gun with marginally higher rate-of-fire. The systems, of which there are so many, don't really congeal into anything recognisable until you do fight a boss, at which point - BANG! Housemarque.Like Resogun or Nex Machina, Returnal is actually best at its hardest - when it's beyond hard, even, the point where there's so much on the screen you have to enter a kind of trance, hypnotised by swirls of projectiles, particles, bolts of instant death, Bobby Krlic's screaming, raging techno-metal blurring with giants' roars and conjuring a kind of subliminal survival beat, a rhythm to which you must stick in order to dodge, dash, fire, reload. Play these sections on instinct and the unconscious mind and you'll come out the other side of difficulty into something else entirely, something oddly serene. These are where you see the history as heritage, how it's more than an obligation or slavish devotion but something to be protected and preserved. It is totally unmatched.And then what a thud back down to Earth. In comparison to those climaxes Returnal's regular combat can't find the right pacing, can't find a beat. It's stop-start and it spikes dramatically, flipping erratically from banal to cruel and often feeling like it wants to trip you up or catch you out - to piss you off, frankly, which it often does. This is where the hostility returns again: Returnal nicks Gears of War's active reload (why haven't more games pilfered that?) but it insists on making it more risky, more awkward, more of a gamble. Reload is mapped to the same trigger as fire, which means watching every spray, every tap, to ensure you pause and restart at the perfect moment lest you screw yourself into a jam. It maps aim to a half-pull of the left trigger, your super-like Alt-Fire to a full pull, which feels like a superfluous skill-check on how hard you grip your controller (turns out for me: like my life depends on it).Further still its Returnal's inscrutable UI, which is a purposeful play for immersion in Selene's own brain fog - shoutouts in particular to the early-game map, which landed me in an accidental rematch with the first boss, and the laughably small cooldown meter for your Alt-Fire, a teenie tiny square which must be about four pixels wide. A cooldown meter for ants.Most troublesome of all though is the world itself, the way its arranged, the way you navigate it, the incentives it creates. Atropos is almost a masterwork. Depending on what you're doing it expands and contracts. When you first enter a new biome it's vast. You don't know how far away the end is, you don't know what lies the other side of any door, down any secret passage, in any chest. It takes hours upon hours to explore. There are scores of set areas in the procedural pool that each run pulls from. Everything is lethal. Everything is alien and new. At this point it's sublime - but there are just six biomes, and they each only make that first impression once. Beyond that, when you reach a boss, it contracts, the game folding in on itself, almost losing its own confidence: a shortcut makes itself available to you, and suddenly you've no urge to explore, no incentive to, crucially, because of the risk.From then until you beat that boss, you are trapped in a miserable loop - clearly intentional; this is Selene's fate, after all - and it makes for a dilemma where both options equal pain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d0e0da0-ae9c-4652-b09d-0a0573ed72a4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d0e0da0-ae9c-4652-b09d-0a0573ed72a4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "aaf1c53e-2416-4bdf-a63f-f5beb3975102", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "82fb855bcf3127bc4f140a470d132f4a075717ca19df929ac8884fd5f4299d9b"}, "3": {"node_id": "983bfab5-9d61-443c-9a9d-9cac317105f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "821649c3c17f16f83718d442fd752c025721be3f5e25c242a220a8bf2932ac03"}}, "hash": "37514d56a4b2df1f26b423ce19dcd46c43a8eea5324ce2aaad08e4eb17dd1380", "text": "Everything you do in Returnal becomes a gamble, and the currency you wager with is your time. Do I take my time and grind the first world, that you must always necessarily trudge through on death, likely earning a larger health bar, more consumables, more single-run passives? You'd think always yes - but with almost every other pickup comes a gamble, via Returnal's Malevolence system, where some items inform you they are essentially cursed and have a set chance of whacking you with a suit malfunction (e.g.: you can't swap weapons until you kill 15 enemies; healing is halved until you kill four enemies at once, et cetera) or chipping away your health. And there's always the very real risk of death by mini boss or misadventure. The alternative on the fork is to sprint straight to the boss, which might take half an hour as opposed to one or two, but gives you a much worse chance at actually beating it. Dare I try it without an expanded health bar? It becomes a question of not \"what's the most fun?\" but \"what feels the least worst?\" Grinding for two hours and getting screwed by bad luck, or banging your head against the wall for several half-hour runs in a row? This is what's stopped me from getting to the end. Exhaustion, over actual difficulty. Bosses only take a couple of tries to beat, some even go down on first attempt, but getting back to them is so arduous, so unpleasant. Suddenly all the peerless beauty of Atropos' worlds becomes overfamiliar, Selene goes totally quiet - no more new fauna to log - and it's just you and the same old monsters. Everyone's extraordinary work on this game begins to unnecessarily grate. It comes back to the combat. And the hostility, for that matter. And the history. And the ambition of what Returnal is really after. This is the ugly side of the roguelite rearing its head, in cahoots with the ugly side of the arcade. There's an implication, from the way Returnal is structured, that it must be harsh to be authentic; that to make permadeath less permanent by, say, making carry-over resources a bit more viable to grind, or the bad luck a bit less punishing, would be to water it down. In fact it would be the opposite. This is what good roguelites do: they recognise that getting very far on a very good run and then dying - by bad luck, bad play, or just losing focus for one moment - doesn't feel great, and so they load the best parts of the games into the run itself, as opposed to the end goal. This is why Hades' randomised builds always make you feel like a god at a minimum, why FTL tells its stories through the impossible blind decisions themselves, why Spelunky makes sure that when it kills you, it kills you with an anecdote: \"I used all my ropes and then fell down a hole\". The genre itself is hostile; it's the game's job to invite you back.Returnal gets halfway to doing it. It is full of real, bona fide video game magic, but with each death it becomes less special, more mundane, and this is why it feels so difficult to pick up the controller again, why Returnal feels like it doesn't want to be played. But the magic it does have is transcendent.

It was obvious at the time that Returnal owed a significant debt to Metroid Prime but playing the two games back to back that connection seems even more explicit. That should only be considered a compliment though, as Returnal is by no means a clone and the most important similarity between the two games is that they\u2019re amongst the best of their generation.Although the PC version has been developed by British company Climax Studios, the original Returnal is the work of Finnish developer Housemarque, who was previously best known for arcade style action games such as Super Stardust and the superb Nex Machina.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3143a54a-ada0-482d-9131-b4a237c70520": {"__data__": {"id_": "3143a54a-ada0-482d-9131-b4a237c70520", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "983bfab5-9d61-443c-9a9d-9cac317105f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "821649c3c17f16f83718d442fd752c025721be3f5e25c242a220a8bf2932ac03"}, "3": {"node_id": "faa798ed-5fc4-4752-aed7-5615b890303f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "907429b17000c3941847572ebe5a0a5eeea1e4143b0ab6c6d78c0f6d08cf935b"}}, "hash": "c7196fea4b608d3132575e4c022ed2637e07b47191c99573c7c25f4cd1e3b82c", "text": "Returnal was really their first attempt at a more expansive, action adventure game and yet it\u2019s of such a high quality you would\u2019ve assumed they\u2019d been making such games for decades.We\u2019re desperately keen to know what they\u2019re working on next, which has been implied to not be a sequel, but any chance to tackle Returnal again is very welcome, even if this is a fairly straightforward PC port that adds little of consequence beyond a few technical refinements. You do also get the extra DLC released after launch though and if nothing else, this has been a chance to dive more deeply into that.Although Returnal does have a narrative it is entirely open to interpretation. A bit too opaque, you could argue, but what\u2019s important is not so much what\u2019s going on as how it makes you feel. Ostensibly, the plot casts you as scientist Selene Vassos, who crash lands on a mysterious planet where she becomes locked in a loop where every time she dies she regenerates back at her ship.There\u2019re elements of Tom Cruise film Edge Of Tomorrow, including in terms of the creature designs, but what at first seems like a relatively straightforward sci-fi adventure increasingly becomes a Lovecraftian nightmare.The lonely, melancholic atmosphere and colour-coded biomes are very reminiscent of Metroid Prime, as are the relatively small, self-contained areas you move between, but there are only relatively minor Metroidvania element in terms of gameplay, as this is primarily a third person shooter. As you might have already guessed by the mention of time loops, it\u2019s a roguelike, although for some reason Housemarque were reticent to describe it as such when it first came out.It takes a while for the roguelike elements to become evident, so the first thing that strikes you is what a fantastic shooter this is. Housemarque\u2019s experience with arcade action games is levered perfectly, to create what is essentially a 3D bullet hell shooter, with the creatures you fight spewing huge showers of neon-coloured projectiles which at first seem impossible to avoid but merely require the right tactics and forward planning.When you die you do retain some proof of your progress, although this is primarily limited to unlocking new weapons and equipment, so that they have a chance to appear randomly during your next run. Each weapon also has randomly assigned attachments that can make them especially useful, with the relatively straightforward pistols and assault rifles (and a sword) to a gun that spits electrified nets and the wonderful Dreadbound, that shoots giant boomerang like bullets.The stages themselves are handcrafted but the order in which they appear is randomised each loop, as is the direction you enter them from, which combined with, mostly, randomised enemy appearances means repeating the same levels again and again is not nearly as repetitive as it might sound. Returnal is very difficult \u2013 comparisons with Dark Souls are not unwarranted \u2013 but it\u2019s far from impossible, as long as you retain a cautious attitude and know how to deal with each of the enemy forms.There is an awkward difficult spike at the halfway mark but otherwise this is a game remarkably short on unequivocal flaws, even if it is easy to blame a bad run on being unlucky with the level layout or weapon distribution. There were also complaints, at the launch of the PlayStation 5 version, that you couldn\u2019t suspend a run and return to it later, but that was addressed in a later update and is available from the start here.There\u2019s more detail in our original review but we can\u2019t move onto the DLC without also praising the excellent boss battles, with one of them in particular, which makes inspired use of licensed music, being one of the best of the modern era.We suspect many will be unfamiliar with the DLC, as it arrived quite a while after the main game and was not well publicised. There are two main components, the first being a co-op mode where another player takes the role of a different Selene from another loop, which does actually make sense in the context of the game\u2019s story.Having another person with you changes the atmosphere of the game completely, although whether it makes it easier depends entirely on who you\u2019re playing with. Although unfortunately there\u2019s no cross-play with the PlayStation 5.The other new mode is called Tower of Sisyphus, which is basically a randomised survival mode where you try and last as long as possible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "faa798ed-5fc4-4752-aed7-5615b890303f": {"__data__": {"id_": "faa798ed-5fc4-4752-aed7-5615b890303f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "3143a54a-ada0-482d-9131-b4a237c70520", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c7196fea4b608d3132575e4c022ed2637e07b47191c99573c7c25f4cd1e3b82c"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3de27f2-f788-4e6a-8b24-7b037ec41977", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2632156e2e2f17bfaaaf8deaebe409e6a1ff25303cf83ab9b30ca9c6cc0409a8"}}, "hash": "907429b17000c3941847572ebe5a0a5eeea1e4143b0ab6c6d78c0f6d08cf935b", "text": "Not an original idea but it works well with Returnal\u2019s various systems and is a good showcase for the fantastic combat.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationIn terms of PC specific features you\u2019ve got various ray-tracing options, 4K and upscaling tech such as DLSS and AMD\u2019s FSR, plus support for ultrawide and super ultrawide monitors. The original was never a technical powerhouse \u2013 despite being a PlayStation 5 exclusive it looked like something straight out of the previous generation \u2013 but as with anything on the PC the mod community may have something to say about that.No matter what format you play it on, Returnal is a modern classic and deserves to be appreciated by as many people as possible. Its many inspirations are not hard to spot and yet the mix of old school, 2D sensibilities with modern 3D gameplay and exploration is seamless. The game forces you to replay the action whenever you die but the real problem is forcing yourself to stop.In Short: One of the best PlayStation exclusives of recent years is an inspired mix of bullet hell shooter and roguelike dungeon crawler, that somehow still feels like nothing else on console or PC.Pros: Superb action, with the best ever interpretation of bullet hell in a 3D environment and some fantastic boss battles. Excellent use of roguelike elements and exploration. Intriguing story and atmosphere. DLC modes are very welcome.Cons: The random elements will, inevitably, not always turn in your favour.

If you grant them that then it means they currently have a 100% record in terms of quality PlayStation 5 exclusives. But given the curious lack of pre-release promotion we\u2019re sure many don\u2019t know what to expect from Returnal. That\u2019s not an easy thing to answer but it involves joy, pain, wonder, confusion, and Sony\u2019s best new franchise since The Last Of Us.Returnal is by Finnish developer Housemarque who, despite a rather short gameography, have been going since the Amiga demo days of the early 90s. They\u2019re best known for PlayStation indie titles Stardust and Resogun but unfortunately not for the excellent Nex Machina, a fantastic top-down shooter whose commercial failure led to them foreswearing the development of old school arcade games. That was upsetting not just because they\u2019re so good at them but because of the obvious difficulty, and financial risk, of transitioning to more complex AAA titles.They first tried to jump aboard the battle royale band wagon with Stormdivers but stopped working on it, and all other projects, to concentrate on Returnal. They essentially bet everything on a completely new property, something companies many times their size never dare to do. That gamble has paid off handsomely, though, with a game that marries the best of old school arcade gameplay with elements of roguelikes, Metroidvania, and surprisingly serious storytelling. The end result won\u2019t be for everyone but it\u2019s an absolute triumph nonetheless.Returnal may be a brand new IP but its heady mix of influences are clear to see.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3de27f2-f788-4e6a-8b24-7b037ec41977": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3de27f2-f788-4e6a-8b24-7b037ec41977", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "faa798ed-5fc4-4752-aed7-5615b890303f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "907429b17000c3941847572ebe5a0a5eeea1e4143b0ab6c6d78c0f6d08cf935b"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ee0d412-d948-4eea-8902-4a7271b80476", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7372ffb7ab2dfad2fc8a23820b88d472db2c95dd0e67f9f53414e2f475941c48"}}, "hash": "2632156e2e2f17bfaaaf8deaebe409e6a1ff25303cf83ab9b30ca9c6cc0409a8", "text": "A cross between Dark Souls and Metroid Prime is probably the simplest way to describe the game, but the structure is that of roguelikes such as Hades and Dead Cells, while the third person gunplay also folds in aspects of bullet hell 2D shooters. There are smaller steals from other games, such as the active reload system from Gears Of War, but, despite the third person view, it\u2019s definitely Metroid Prime that comes across as the primary inspiration.The story is also an unlikely mishmash of influences, from H.P. Lovecraft to Stanis\u0142aw Lem, with very little information given at first. All the intro reveals is that you play astronaut Selene, who crash lands on an alien world full of angry, tentacled monsters that seem to have wiped out the original inhabitants. When Selene inevitably dies, she finds herself waking up from the crash once again, with (almost) everything reset back the way it was, in true roguelike fashion.The game isn\u2019t plot heavy but continuing revelations see you begin to question Selene\u2019s past and her state of mind before and after the crash, although we\u2019d warn you in advance that the ending leaves a great deal up to your own interpretation and is unlikely to fully satisfy anyone. Thankfully the gameplay suffers no such fault.Although Housemarque has no real experience with third person action games the first thing you realise about Returnal is what a great shooter it is. The gunplay feels fantastic and while Selene lacks the athleticism of a game like Vanquish the 2D shooter influence works superbly well, given that by dashing you can pass unharmed through most enemy projectiles. Together with a powerful melee attack, that\u2019s necessary to take down shields, Returnal would\u2019ve worked perfectly well as a straight action game, as you create an unscripted ballet of beautiful violence during every encounter.The action is only part of the game though, as there\u2019s also a strong exploration aspect, with each biome split up into discrete rooms, complete with Metroid style doors separating them. Monsters can pass between the doors, but usually don\u2019t, so this definitely isn\u2019t open world. Although many of the rooms don\u2019t contain any enemies at all, but instead platform sections and other obstacles that hide helpful items.When you die you lose everything except a resource called ether and, once you hit a particular point in the story, a certain amount of proficiency, which dictates the minimum level of whatever weapon you pick up from containers. It\u2019s not quite as straightforward as that though, as once you collect a new type of weapon it enters the random rotation of those you can obtain in a subsequent run. The weapon upgrades which you unlock by using that particular gun are also retained between loops of the game, although those upgrades are always randomised so you rarely get exactly the same weapon twice.Artifacts which grant all manner of perks and benefits work in a similar way, in that you have to purposefully unlock the better ones, that then become random pick-ups in subsequent loops. That\u2019s all relatively generous for a roguelike, especially as you can also unlock shortcuts to other biomes, but there\u2019s no question that having to start almost from scratch each time you die is going to frustrate some people, especially as the game is very hard.When a new loop starts the layout of each biome also changes, although rather than being procedurally-generated each room is handcrafted \u2013 they\u2019re just remixed and switched around at random, so you can never predict exactly what you\u2019ll face on a subsequent run.There are a great number of other, welcome, complications, including parasites which grant both a positive and negative trait \u2013 with you having to choose which outweighs the other. Many objects and containers are \u2018malignant\u2019 and risk causing a suit malfunction (i.e. a debuff) if you pick them up, which then has to be removed by completing a specific task, such as crafting an item or using a one-shot collectible.It\u2019s a complex mix of systems and gameplay styles but it runs almost like clockwork, each element of gameplay enhancing the other. There is the occasional exception though, where if you\u2019re unlucky it can be halfway through the opening biome before you find a decent new gun and if that\u2019s compounded by you encountering an unusually strong enemy a run is ruined before it\u2019s even begun.We\u2019re also not huge fans of the creature design, which seems to be primarily inspired by Tom Cruise movie Edge of Tomorrow (which is a. seriously underrated and b. also about time loops), along with a soup\u00e7on of Avatar.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ee0d412-d948-4eea-8902-4a7271b80476": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ee0d412-d948-4eea-8902-4a7271b80476", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3de27f2-f788-4e6a-8b24-7b037ec41977", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2632156e2e2f17bfaaaf8deaebe409e6a1ff25303cf83ab9b30ca9c6cc0409a8"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a774c4d-e458-4faa-8fe6-abe87bc39671", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b8921cc143956718237e7946b7f88e167606599eb26bbe7c468f5e328191ce0"}}, "hash": "7372ffb7ab2dfad2fc8a23820b88d472db2c95dd0e67f9f53414e2f475941c48", "text": "The designs are fine in isolation, but the majority of enemies are covered in flailing tentacles and with the bigger ones it can be very difficult to work out which is which when you\u2019ve only got a split second to decide your tactics.These are relatively minor problems though and the only other issue is that pre-launch, the game is quite glitchy and we\u2019ve had several crash bugs that have ruined otherwise promising runs. A day one patch promises to fix the issue but if it doesn\u2019t then Sony are going to quickly find themselves in hot water.In terms of the visuals, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything that wouldn\u2019t be possible on the PlayStation 4, especially as the rooms are relatively small, but then this clearly doesn\u2019t have the same budget as most internally developed Sony games. There are some nice-looking areas though, with great use of volumetric fog, and the DualSense is used fantastically well, in terms of the triggers and the haptic feedback \u2013 especially the pitter patter of rain on your gamepad.In terms of difficultly we\u2019re a little wary of making any definitive statement, as we\u2019re still not sure whether the experience we had with the game will be similar to anyone else\u2019s. Our first few hours saw plenty of deaths, but once things started to click we needed only two attempts at the first boss, before getting to the second biome. To our surprise we then managed to ace both that and the third one on our first attempt, including the bosses. None of it felt in the slightest bit easy but with a good store of power-ups and resources, and a healthy sense of paranoia, we persevered.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationThat was until a plot twist in the second act forcibly reset the loop and we lost all the items we\u2019d steadily built up. From then on, we struggled through the rest of the game, making progress in slow, stilted steps that were much more reminiscent of playing Dark Souls. It was still fun but the elation of the first act, and the feeling of true mastery, required a lot more effort to rekindle. The plot twist is clearly a purposeful difficulty spike but there\u2019s no question it\u2019s a frustrating one.What we would say though is that Returnal is by far the most fun we\u2019ve had with a video game all year. Despite being a new IP it doesn\u2019t always feel entirely original, given how liberally it borrows ideas from other games, but even when Lady Luck abandoned us we were always quick to get back up and try again. The action is perfectly crafted but the way it interfaces with the exploration and story aspects is just as impressive, as it creates an endlessly entertaining experience that we\u2019d be playing again and again even if there was no time loop.In Short: What should have been a hotchpotch of other people\u2019s ideas, made worse by frustratingly high difficulty, is in reality one of the most cleverly designed video games of recent years, with superb action and endless replayability.Pros: Excellent gunplay and movement system, with engaging exploration and a wide variety of customisation options. Good use of randomly generated levels and other roguelike elements. Ambitious storytelling.Cons: Random factor can occasionally ruin a good run through no fault of your own. Odd difficulty spike could easily put some people off.Score: 9/10Formats: PlayStation 5Price: \u00a369.99Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentDeveloper: HousemarqueRelease Date: 30th April 2021Age Rating: 16Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : Sony to \u2018aggressively\u2019 invest in more first party PS5 exclusives says exec\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Returnal could be the most important game on the PS5 \u2013 Reader\u2019s Feature", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a774c4d-e458-4faa-8fe6-abe87bc39671": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a774c4d-e458-4faa-8fe6-abe87bc39671", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ee0d412-d948-4eea-8902-4a7271b80476", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7372ffb7ab2dfad2fc8a23820b88d472db2c95dd0e67f9f53414e2f475941c48"}, "3": {"node_id": "5888e2e7-d07d-4028-8095-9c46c12e3009", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f29b8f7ed5a316ad9f6dc752d9ff61086f1d1c6ac151a7b30094709c2f600f98"}}, "hash": "8b8921cc143956718237e7946b7f88e167606599eb26bbe7c468f5e328191ce0", "text": "MORE : Destruction AllStars review \u2013 a free ride on PS5\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.ukFor more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGamesRadar+, When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Only your wits and the discarded pistol of what looks like your own corpse to help you survive. By the time you\u2019ve acquainted yourself with this roguelike\u2019s basics, just about getting a handle of how quickly stranded astronaut Selene can glide through environments, a luminescent monster comes along to body you and start the real task of trying to break out of this Alien-meets-Groundhog-Day nightmare.\u00a0Release date: April 30, 2021\nPlatform(s): PS5\nDeveloper: Housemarque\nPublisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentWhile Ridley Scott\u2019s seminal classic might be the game\u2019s most obvious visual reference - from the putrid egg-shaped wildlife to the dull green hum of the game\u2019s menus - Returnal as a whole isn\u2019t quite as easy to nail down. While the action is pure bullet-hell twitch adrenaline, with your screen teeming with fluorescent orbs that stand in stark contrast to the harsh, dark colors of the environment, the game\u2019s story is elliptically told through brief, ominous flashes of life back on Earth. Add on a structure that is reminiscent of Hades, where death gives you just a scrap of new information each time, it all adds up to a real grab bag of influences. While they initially seem at odds with each other, they come together to create one of Sony\u2019s most beguilingly weird blockbusters in a long time.The main reason you\u2019ll want to come to Returnal is the game\u2019s combat, an evolution of Housemarque\u2019s signature run and gun style that introduces a significant risk/reward dynamic. Killing enemies will increase Selene\u2019s Adrenaline levels, which grant perks such as bigger active reload windows or enhanced melee attacks, but take one hit and you\u2019ll have to build them up again. Add on a combination of well-balanced weapons and challenging enemies, which really sings once the screen is overflowing, and it\u2019s a combat loop you\u2019ll happily trap yourself in. In terms of the arsenal that Selene can find scattered around, although you start with a discarded pistol, there\u2019s a range of guns to quickly discover that each comes with considered strengths and weaknesses. Over time, you\u2019ll develop your own style of play thanks to the permanent traits you can unlock with them.\u00a0For instance, I tend to prioritize the Electropylon Driver (EPD), which deals damage over time and can be used to lay traps for enemies, with spikes that dig into the ground and a current connecting them if they\u2019re close enough. This allows me to keep a healthy distance from enemies, knowing I can retreat and that they\u2019ll still be taking damage if I\u2019ve got a few hits on them. However, the EPD isn\u2019t a great close-range weapon, and considering there are plenty of foes who will rush me, diving at my feet and exploding on impact, it means I have to be wary of letting myself get swarmed. Of course, if you\u2019re more aggressive, you can focus on upgrading the traits of the Spitmaw Blaster, a powerful shotgun that\u2019s devastating up close and a peashooter at range. No strategy is perfect and that allows for you to tackle Returnal in a way that suits you, without ever feeling like you\u2019re getting an easy ride with your weapon.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5888e2e7-d07d-4028-8095-9c46c12e3009": {"__data__": {"id_": "5888e2e7-d07d-4028-8095-9c46c12e3009", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a774c4d-e458-4faa-8fe6-abe87bc39671", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b8921cc143956718237e7946b7f88e167606599eb26bbe7c468f5e328191ce0"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1e65588-8ef4-494c-a533-9f510e8b53df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f12767bc064ba5c8ed8477ff6876ea38da0ff68e1b2d91830b8c0d06c394f883"}}, "hash": "f29b8f7ed5a316ad9f6dc752d9ff61086f1d1c6ac151a7b30094709c2f600f98", "text": "As you fight through the game\u2019s six biomes, enemies present a real challenge, from cannon fodder that you\u2019ll take out in a couple of hits to more complex sub-bosses that require agility and aggression to overcome. No creature represents an insignificant challenge, and each can take you down quickly, especially early on, which creates a real sense of jeopardy throughout each cycle, as you dive, weave, and (once you\u2019ve unlocked the hook) grapple across contained areas. At full flow though, it hits the sweet spot of making you feel like you\u2019re just about in control without ever feeling under-challenged. \u00a0However, there are frustrating issues that will have you moaning when you die. For one, the game never quite resolves the main problem with 3D bullet-hells, where you can be struck by a projectile that comes from off-screen. If that is a minor annoyance, then the design of arenas is more of an important one. The game\u2019s environments, which are appealing enough to stave off any boredom from looking at them repeatedly, all have some degree of danger when it comes to bottomless drops. But on more than a few occasions, I found myself dashing back to avoid a wave of projectiles only to go tumbling because I couldn\u2019t see the cliff behind me. I\u2019ll happily admit that I\u2019m not the most spatially aware at the best of times, but it does cheapen some of the otherwise excellent action. \u00a0Similarly, these issues are also compounded by the RNG baked into the game\u2019s structure. Every time you die in Returnal, you lose your gun, and any of the Parasites (critters that latch on and grant you a buff and debuff) you\u2019ve found. There are a few permanent upgrades, but on the whole, progress is by and large reset with death. While that\u2019s not uncommon in a roguelike, it does mean that cycles can be heavily influenced by what randomly spawns in, especially when some items are infected with malignancy, which means you can take them, but you\u2019ll get a suit malfunction that makes the game harder, such as your map getting scrambled or an increased dash cooldown.\u00a0I struggled on my first few cycles, and then discovered a Parasite that gave me an auto-repair buff with damage from a long fall debuff. This is an extremely good perk with a quite soft caveat, and it meant I was able to get through the game\u2019s first three worlds in one cycle by playing conservatively when I was on death\u2019s door. While the balance can feel off on some runs, where you pick some handy attachments early on or limp on through without much to aid you, it doesn\u2019t distract too much from that core combat loop. \u00a0Of course, Returnal isn\u2019t all spraying and praying. Like Hades, it also wants to tell a complete story within the structure of a roguelike, and it\u2019s this intriguing story that helps pull you through the more intense moments of frustration. Selene\u2019s tale is told through Scout Logs you\u2019ll find scattered throughout the worlds you explore, as well as first-person segments that put you inside her house (which has mystifyingly turned up on Atropos) and play like a simplistic P.T., all foreboding corridors and shifting environments. While trips into the house are very much Horror 101, a few misdirects followed by the occasional jump scare, they help create a sense of mystery that you want to unravel as you embark on each new cycle.\u00a0While the overarching themes, which start in sci-fi before slowly evolving into something far grander, intrigue, Selene\u2019s character suffers from this isolation. While Hades created a cast of hilarious, fully-formed characters who are a joy to learn from, Returnal puts Selene front and center, with only her own voice for company throughout the game. She is a cipher for the most part, someone who is deathly determined to carry out her mission with seemingly little agency of her own. While this makes sense for what the story wants to do - and we\u2019re not expecting belly laughs from a game about trying to escape a living hell of blasting away aliens on a distant planet - it does mean the human elements of her predicament don\u2019t land quite as forcefully as they could have done. \n\nI have to admit that, despite reaching the credits twice now, which comes with its own moment of partial resolution, there\u2019s still plenty left for me to discover.

Rain feels like it\u2019s coming through your controller with the pitter-patter effect of the DualSense, while a clever use of the triggers lets you aim by pulling the LT a little, and using a weapon\u2019s alt-fire by bringing it in fully. Letting a volley of projectiles fly while your controller buzzes away is an endless simple pleasure. While 3D audio might be initially less noticeable, the little chittering of Parasites or booming drones in the distance all come together to sell the game\u2019s alien environments more convincingly.\u00a0But while Sony has been keen to emphasize these elements of the game, it perhaps does a disservice to Housemarque\u2019s fine action and compelling story. Returnal is a breakaway from the type of exclusive Sony has focused on in recent years, using a genre that has only recently come back into fashion as a starting point for a story that makes you work to understand it, offering plenty to chew on without wrapping it up neatly. It\u2019s an unexpectedly daring step forward for a developer who has refined what makes its style so compelling while adding in new elements.\u00a0Returnal was reviewed on PS5 with code supplied by Sony.Hello, I'm GamesRadar's News Editor.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nGame Informer, Returnal is a powerful roguelike recipe offering intense combat, a drip-fed narrative of palpable dread, and a cohesive combination of artistic elements. Housemarque\u2019s third-person shooter delivers lightning-fast action transfused with incredible exploration, featuring equal doses of intensity and lingering unease. Every run is the start of something new, but what you learn over many failures provides an extra edge as you attempt to chart the sci-fi horror world of Atropos. Returnal deftly combines gameplay, graphics, and musical composition to create a haunting tapestry that\u2019s an absolute joy to partake in, even when a mistimed dodge or a sinister trap claims your life.Returnal is a challenging game that puts relatively high demands on the player. There are no difficulty dials to tweak, so the experience can feel overbearing at times, especially in one of the later stages. While this adds to the overarching horror elements that exude from Returnal\u2019s core and enhances the sweaty grip-for-your-life moment of slaying a massive boss, it\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s possible to lose hours of potential progress in mere seconds should things go awry. Death is inevitable and can be devastating. Being willing to learn and ready to adapt your strategies and glean takeaways for future runs is essential. I felt that the challenges presented by Returnal enhanced the nature of the unknown alien planet and that these elements contributed positively to the overall game. Still, some players may find these asks to be outside of their enjoyment range.As Selene, who gets stranded on an alien planet, your journey on Atropos brings questions and exciting revelations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "921dde96-1771-4236-852b-cdef8146db23": {"__data__": {"id_": "921dde96-1771-4236-852b-cdef8146db23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1e65588-8ef4-494c-a533-9f510e8b53df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f12767bc064ba5c8ed8477ff6876ea38da0ff68e1b2d91830b8c0d06c394f883"}, "3": {"node_id": "4220265f-bfbc-4bff-acf3-da778064d31e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc97fe6563602f4f2cedbdc09b77ed6b6204c35e4d6d964fcb7e8f761c30751"}}, "hash": "8d4f7e2e50e4eda681c4b3c190fbdce91413abffe82c1aa631da18ce2166f9c3", "text": "The story is communicated slice-by-slice over time as you work through different biomes, with each narrative piece adding one element to a larger puzzle that\u2019s a pleasure to work out. While anything but a blissful fairy tale, the narrative functions more like a soothing balm to the endless cycle of doomed runs and discomforting discoveries. When things were at their worst after a few failed runs, at least I was learning more about the mysteries that tie the world together. Try not to get spoiled by the story before playing the game, as it\u2019s a pleasure to put together clue-by-clue.The exploration through the biomes is procedurally generated in some respects, but you learn to recognize rooms and what\u2019s inside each one over time. This knowledge is power. Exploring carefully and mastering each space can lead to discovering hidden powerups tucked away in hard-to-find places, whether they are behind false walls or just out of sight on a precipice above. In addition to the temporary build that you craft each run, there are other permanent unlocks for your character to uncover. As you make progress, areas that you couldn\u2019t previously access become available via tools like a grappling hook, hazard-protection boots, the ability to travel underwater, and more. Every time you find one of these new tools feels incredible as you can finally access areas that have taunted you with treasures for many, many runs. With each traversal find, you breathe a sigh of relief as a checkpoint is locked in.Applying learned knowledge to situations and scenarios carries over to combat, which is incredibly fast and rooted in the \u201cbullet-hell\u201d genre. Players must avoid various objects on the screen, each with its own pattern and directional movement. Learning each pattern on standard enemies is a constant battle as you progress, as new and deadlier abilities and patterns regularly appear. Boss battles take this to the next level, and you will find yourself relying on muscle memory and perhaps uttering a quick prayer while attempting to dodge growing rings, moving barriers, and hundreds of projectiles at varying speeds simultaneously. Throughout the game, you may be surprised at just what you can accomplish in this regard. Several times I said to myself, \u201cNo way,\u201d as the game pushed another blitz of swirling projectiles onto my screen, but with well-timed dodges and jumps, I shocked even myself. Patterns that seemed challenging at first became laughable as I mastered the game's many systems, and it feels great to complete encounters with finesse.Avoiding things is half of the battle. The other half is shooting back. In Returnal, you unlock a variety of different weapons with various modes of fire and traits to unlock over time, which is sort of a permanent progression mechanic that improves your damage output from run to run. I became a huge fan of the rocket and grenade launcher archetypes and their various tweaks, which allowed me to pay more attention to getting out of the way while issuing my payloads. However, you never really know which weapon will be your best option during a run, so you have to become comfortable using a lot of them regardless. This keeps things fresh and had me stuck with one of my least favorite weapons during a particularly tough boss fight, but it\u2019s all part of the freshness that comes with each run. You never know what you\u2019re going to get, and you have to use everything together to survive. In true roguelike fashion, you may have runs with excellent weapons where you make a ton of progress across multiple biomes, and in others, you may perish a room or two into your adventure.Risk and reward are intricately tied together in Returnal, as there are numerous upgrades you can find that come with the risk of a malfunction that debuffs your character when you collect them. This means you might be able to increase your health pool or collect some bonus resources, but you might get a serious penalty as a price, like losing 85 percent of your damage while stationary. You can ditch these penalties by completing different goals, so careful planning for when to take on the risk of malfunctions is essential, as they can completely change the way you play. A late-game biome plays with the concept of issuing malfunctions for getting hit by some enemies, which, as you can imagine, is a massive incentive to up your dodge game. Learning how to manage malfunctions is a long process of weighing when and if to pick up specific bonuses, and it can make a huge difference on a run. Again, the theme of learning over time comes into play here, and I enjoyed tinkering with my risk profile on each run.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4220265f-bfbc-4bff-acf3-da778064d31e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4220265f-bfbc-4bff-acf3-da778064d31e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "921dde96-1771-4236-852b-cdef8146db23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d4f7e2e50e4eda681c4b3c190fbdce91413abffe82c1aa631da18ce2166f9c3"}, "3": {"node_id": "13237fc3-75b5-4f27-bba3-39e32828980c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cfb2d57c28790335daf2536e23452463a7ba374c70426bb570a3277237412b53"}}, "hash": "dfc97fe6563602f4f2cedbdc09b77ed6b6204c35e4d6d964fcb7e8f761c30751", "text": "Some runs, say when you are off to a bad start, the philosophy just becomes \u201cwell, I\u2019m going to die anyway, why not roll the dice?\u201d And sometimes, those dice roll in your favor.Returnal is a delightful immersion for the senses, even if the aspect it\u2019s trying to convey is horrifying, lingering dread. It nails it in this regard, and is drenched with both in-your-face monstrosities and lurking terror. Enemy designs are hideous amalgamations of tentacles and teeth, which feel right at home in this bizarre alien hellscape. One of the late-game biomes is incredibly distressing to explore and may even significantly deter some players with\u00a0thalassophobia.The soundtrack, primarily composed by Bobby Krlic (Midsommar), provides a haunting backdrop that contributes immensely to Returnal\u2019s constant and rising sense of trepidation. The unnerving melodies gnaw at the back of your mind long after you set the controller down. One stage in particular hinges on music, and the feeling that you get while climbing up to the boss as it gets louder and louder exudes cacophonic anxiety.

Aside from unlocking new levels of performance not possible on the PlayStation 5, Returnal arrives with some welcome new visual settings, an array of settings for display and upscaling options, and a bar-setting benchmark tool that helps you fine-tune performance far better than any other I've ever used.Returnal is a technical showpiece on the PS5, with remarkably rich art direction making each of the six distinct biomes a pleasure to explore. Its bright, neon particles and large, deadly projectiles flood environments and bathe them in a variety of colors, accentuating the exhilarating, fast-paced gunplay. On PC, it's action that's still best enjoyed with the controller it was ultimately designed for, the DualSense. If you use one with your PC setup, and you use it wired, you'll have full access to the same control scheme that was present on the PS5, including its marvelous use of the adaptive triggers to augment primary and secondary fire. It's just fine on any other controller, too, with appropriate button mapping making the gameplay feel just as natural. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the responsiveness of a mouse and keyboard feels transformative to Returnal, allowing me to zip around rooms and pull off deadly accurate shots with ease. Whichever way you choose to play, Returnal feels fantastic on PC.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Returnal Video ReviewReturnal's gameplay lives and dies on responsiveness, making anything below 60fps almost impossible to recommend.

Nvidia's DLSS (without DLSS 3's frame-generation) and AMD's FSR are present as expected, but developers Housemarque and Climax Studio have also added Nvidia NIS (a linear image scaling technique similar to AMD's FSR that is platform agnostic), Adaptive and Linearly Scaled Resolutions options, and Variable Rate Shading (an option that reduces shading on unimportant parts of the current frame, reducing hardware demand). Having FSR and DLSS is somewhat expected of a good PC port today, but the addition of the rest is a welcome surprise that should give you plenty of avenues to try and hone in performance.Aiding in that endeavor is Returnal's best-in-class benchmark tool. Usually, these are nothing more than a way to see how a game might run at a specified settings preset, but Returnal's goes a step further by breaking down each aspect of the game that it's testing. From its particle system to thick volumetric fog, each scene bundles certain visual settings together and tests them specifically, allowing you to see exactly how your hardware is coping. The results screen at the end lets you scrub through each of these sections while also informing you which parts of your system are being tested in each one. This is invaluable in figuring out which settings to change to boost performance efficiently, and which likely won't make a difference, taking out a lot of guesswork typical of this process.Sadly, no matter how much time you spend tinkering with settings, Returnal is currently a bit too much for the Steam Deck to handle. I attempted to run the game on its lowest graphical preset, at a resolution slightly lower than native, and with FSR set to Performance (thus rendering the game at 50% of its resolution), and it was impossible to maintain a stable 30fps, nevermind anything close to double that. This was in some of the least-demanding early sections of the game, meaning the later chaotic ones would likely fare even worse. Returnal hasn't been officially certified for Steam Deck yet, so there's the possibility this could change, but it could be just too much for the portable device to ever handle.There is one facet of Returnal's gameplay that its robust benchmark misses, however. Loading between each new procedurally-generated room that you enter routinely caused a large stutter, irrespective of which settings I was using. It was generally abrupt enough to plummet my framerate down from the mid-90s to somewhere in the 30s for a second, which was more than enough to make it distracting. Given the speed at which you're making your way through Returnal's biomes, having this happen consistently was incredibly distracting, and not something I would've expected given the game was installed on an incredibly fast Samsung 980 Pro SSD.Although the performance on Steam Deck is disappointing and the consistent hitches are an annoyance, Returnal is another great port of a previous PlayStation 5 exclusive. It opens up the intoxicating gameplay loop to a new audience while offering all the bells and whistles expected of a modern PC port, with the addition of a remarkably robust benchmark tool and an impressive amount of graphical and rendering settings to fine-tune performance. Returnal has long been one of the best PS5 games, and now it could stand as one of the best on PC, too. -- Alessandro BarbosaYou can read our original review of the PS5 version, published on April 29, 2021, below.Returnal is a hard game to pin down. On the one hand, it is very much a pastiche of existing game genres: Play one run and you will see how it very clearly draws elements from roguelikes, Souls-likes, metroidvanias, action-platformers, bullet hell shooters, and horror games. But while it borrows from all those genres, its unique flow ensures that its chaotic shooting galleries and creepy storytelling feel decidedly new. A shifting, but not jarring pace, an unpredictable narrative, tough-as-nails gameplay, and a constant sense of ambient terror--Returnal's many moving parts coalesce into a rare shooter that grabs you with its mechanics and its story and never lets go, seducing you with its challenges and a foreboding sense of dread every step of the way.When you start Returnal, interstellar scout Selene Vassos crash-lands on an alien planet, Atropos, which is broadcasting a mysterious signal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4728f02a-44d5-42aa-91c3-37b2ca854577": {"__data__": {"id_": "4728f02a-44d5-42aa-91c3-37b2ca854577", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "13237fc3-75b5-4f27-bba3-39e32828980c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cfb2d57c28790335daf2536e23452463a7ba374c70426bb570a3277237412b53"}, "3": {"node_id": "9acf4626-7091-46db-a700-4b6c2fc7da16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b431b0cfac51bc29d7db23b03e611759bf28ca703cbe11d9da94aaa75d402818"}}, "hash": "0d32dfc3acc3d2aa6c13a8a4aef19281e9305916c8d03f6d811d6ff5fed59bdb", "text": "Stranded, Selene makes some startling discoveries on the planet, including the game's titular trait: When she dies, Selene \"returns\" to the site of the crash, seemingly unharmed. To explain much more would give away too much: You want to know as little about Returnal and its story as you can going in.Yes, \"return\" is in the name, which is a not-subtle-not to Returnal\u2019s run-based structure. It falls into the broader definition of a roguelite--Selene starts each run from the crash site but holds a few key upgrades and one of two in-game currencies from run to run. Everything else, including her weapon, \"artifacts\" that provide passive upgrades, and consumables like healing items disappear with each death. Selene wanders through the procedurally arranged and populated landscapes of Atropos hoarding gear, upgrading her health and weapon level (called proficiency), and gunning down the planet's strange-looking, tentacle-wiggling creatures, all of which want you dead.Though some swipe at you with teeth, claws, and the aforementioned tentacles, most of your enemies have the ability to shoot some kind of bright, colorful projectiles at you. In a large combat arena, the room very quickly fills with a gauntlet of neon orbs and beams of light for you to sidestep, jump over, and dash through. Each enemy species has its own bullet type with a predictable pattern to learn, but when you put four or more together, even the simple enemies can create complex, beautiful light shows that will put you down if you aren't at the top of your game. Unlike most \"bullet hell\" shooters, where you're looking down from overhead, Returnal puts projectiles in your face and makes you react quickly and gracefully. That can be a challenge: Sometimes the number of bright beams and orbs on screen gets so unwieldy, it feels impossible to keep up. The only way to make things more manageable is to kill your enemies, so you're constantly planning your offense and defense--looking for a route to safety, while also taking aim and whittling down the opposition.Returnal\u2019s combat mechanics reward players who can perfectly dodge enemy attacks while keeping their composure. With every kill, Selene builds up adrenaline, which provides temporary bonuses, like a more powerful melee attack and a glowing aura that makes enemies easier to see, so long as you don\u2019t take damage. There\u2019s also an active reload mechanic, which helps you dish out as much bullet hell as you take. Given the ridiculous number of bullets you have to avoid at any given time, it can be tough to work in a quick reload between dodges. In fact, it pays to know when to skip a reload, rather than risk delaying your next attack. More importantly, it\u2019s an easy and very tangible way to see your skills improve run to run.Selene can find a small but nicely varied array of guns for herself, as well as artifacts, which offer passive upgrades. Her arsenal ranges from classic pistols and assault rifles to the Electropylon Driver, which fires posts that generate laser beams between them, allowing you to trap an enemy in a deadly laser grid. Each weapon type also comes with randomly assigned perks, which you unlock by killing enemies and which persist across runs. As your weapon level grows, the weapons you find have better stats, along with more and better perks. And you always have a sword, which lets you disable enemy shields and can quickly dispatch enemies who get in close. When you have a strong understanding of your tools, you can find a rhythm for working any combat scenario that\u2019s specific to your build.Not every upgrade is entirely a blessing. Many of the items and chests you'll find will be \"malignant,\" so picking up or opening them will incur a temporary penalty until you complete an objective. For example, you may do half as much damage with your sword until you use two consumable items, like a temporary shield or a healing item. You'll also find parasites, which impose both an upgrade and a debuff, and can't be switched out without a special item or device found in the world. While you can simply avoid any items with potential negative impact, it's hard to build up power without them, so the quest to make a winning build often forces you to make some smart compromises and, occasionally, roll the dice to increase your prowess.This wide range of weapons and gear is both a blessing and a curse: On the one hand, you'll never have to run the same strategy twice. On the other, your success is largely contingent on finding the right stuff. This is true in most roguelites to some degree, but it's especially prevalent here: When I had the right gear, I was unstoppable.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9acf4626-7091-46db-a700-4b6c2fc7da16": {"__data__": {"id_": "9acf4626-7091-46db-a700-4b6c2fc7da16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "4728f02a-44d5-42aa-91c3-37b2ca854577", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d32dfc3acc3d2aa6c13a8a4aef19281e9305916c8d03f6d811d6ff5fed59bdb"}, "3": {"node_id": "f44fb8b1-6be6-48be-a77f-e3db60ddaf66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac012aebd6dc29c9482717ed4c039a364fe6dcdbaed220d862835deec36550e9"}}, "hash": "b431b0cfac51bc29d7db23b03e611759bf28ca703cbe11d9da94aaa75d402818", "text": "When I didn't, I struggled to make even incremental progress.You also have to flex your beam-dodging skills with a fair amount of complex platforming. Many rooms will tempt you with items guarded by laser grids or long trails of small platforms. Returnal's controls are tight and responsive, so you have the tools you need to navigate even when the timing is extremely tight, assuming you have the precision and reflexes to master them. (And Reader: I didn't always have them). Having traps, obstacles, and hidden rooms to find in every run means the act of exploring never feels wasteful or boring. You're always desperate for more health or that next upgrade, and even when you come to know the shape of every pre-fab room, there's always a sense that you don't know what might be around the next corner.Though Returnal's basic mechanics fall within the broad specifications of a roguelite, it features more ways to make permanent progress than your average run-based game. Though they change with every life, each zone follows a loose basic structure with a main path and branching side paths. On your first time through each zone, you'll come across a barrier on the main path that you can't breach, either because you need a key or a movement ability you don't have, like a grappling hook or an item that lets you explore underwater. This will lead you down a secondary main path that, once completed, you will not need to repeat on future runs. The result is a shifting and changing micro-run: To reach the next objective, you'll need to play through the next 2-4 hours of the game without dying to advance the story, but you won't need to complete every step on a winning run.It creates a balance between the endurance-based challenge of the traditional roguelite, where you not only need to succeed, but to do so well enough that you can continue on, and the extreme challenge put forth by the bullet hell-style shooting galleries you have to conquer. It also opens the door for Returnal's many challenging boss fights which, in typical Souls-like fashion, asks you to fight giant, daunting enemies that can literally fill the screen with waves of attacks that are as beautiful as they are deadly. No matter the challenge, progress always feels attainable, removing some of the sting from the repetitive, unforgiving nature of the run-based structure.Moreover, on a narrative level, mixing up your objectives helps create a sort of fog around your goals. You always know the way forward, but what you're actually doing changes over time. Between the shifting maps and the ever-changing objectives, you\u2019re never quite sure where you\u2019re headed, which feels nerve-wracking. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re lost--the way forward is almost always clear--but your lack of awareness fosters a general sense of confusion that amplifies this undercurrent of discomfort that washes over you while exploring Atropos.I wouldn't describe Returnal as a horror game, exactly, but it is consistently spooky and occasionally terrifying. You don't get much about Selene, the planet, or why she's there early on, but the mystery is constantly at the forefront of your mind. You receive a drip-feed of information from run to run through audio logs, monologues, and cutscenes, which you find by exploring the different rooms that pop up as you make it closer and closer to your goal. Scouring each area many, many times is crucial to getting the full story, as new notes appear as you make it further in the world and uncover other secrets.Returnal uses that lack of information aggressively, frequently showing you images and referencing events for which you have no context, all in service of creating a slippery understanding of Selene, a nightmarish impression of Atropos, and a mystique around the true nature of your mission. From its first moments, it's clear that something is very wrong, but you have no idea what it is or how it might manifest next. The need to know what's going on never leaves your thoughts, even as it instills a strong sense of ominous dread.The \"horror\" of Returnal is largely sequestered to the narrative of the game, but there are a handful of playable story sequences where it comes through front and center. From time to time, Selene will find an area with her home from Earth, a literal American house, just sitting in the middle of the wilderness. When the time is right and she enters the house, you're put into a short, first-person sequence that focuses on narrative and mood.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f44fb8b1-6be6-48be-a77f-e3db60ddaf66": {"__data__": {"id_": "f44fb8b1-6be6-48be-a77f-e3db60ddaf66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "9acf4626-7091-46db-a700-4b6c2fc7da16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b431b0cfac51bc29d7db23b03e611759bf28ca703cbe11d9da94aaa75d402818"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb9588df-b9f4-43a5-9715-c18ce98e305e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0a321e116360b2934adcef8a37c71d6dde5cd36b9814fc222033e581c699a06"}}, "hash": "ac012aebd6dc29c9482717ed4c039a364fe6dcdbaed220d862835deec36550e9", "text": "You have no guns, no real control over what to do, and you're subjected to some spooky events that teach you more about the world, while sending shivers down your spine.Returnal uses the tech of the PS5 to give you tons of sensory feedback that connects you to the world and amplifies your general state of confusion and fear. When playing with headphones on--and I strongly urge you to do so--you can hear the sounds of creatures rustling through the underbrush and howling in the distance all around you, giving you the sense that you could be attacked at any time. In the heat of combat, using surround sound gives you the chance to keep track of enemies and their attacks by ear. Using the DualSense'\u2019s haptics, you can feel the rain hitting Selene'\u2019s space suit and other environmental effects. Certain weapons perks will also add resistance to the triggers to change how the gun fires, which helps create a tactile connection to the game. (Though, it can be annoying to suddenly find you need to press the trigger twice as hard to fire your gun.)Returnal is constantly unsettling and consistently challenging. Its mysterious story and demanding action feel intense, urgent, and fresh. The fast-moving combat manages to appear incredibly daunting, bordering on overwhelming, without ever actually becoming insurmountable. Every moment is a rush, either because you just barely evaded a giant purple laser or because you have no idea why there's an Apollo-era astronaut following your every move. Do you need to be a little brave to play Returnal? Yeah. Do you need to be glutton for punishment? It helps. They say that anything worth doing should scare you at least a little bit. I'm not sure if that's always true, but Returnal makes a strong case.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:Housemarque\u2019s PS5 exclusive elevates the time loop genreI was losing faith in Returnal until I encountered the second boss.After a few dozen runs, the enchanting presentation and sense of discovery from my first few hours had started to wear off. I felt weak compared to the colossal creatures that defended their territory against an unwanted visitor. I had seen and used all weapons available at the time, slowly unlocking new alt-fires and passive skills for them, but none had managed to impress me enough. The first boss had only taken me a couple of tries to conquer, yet I could barely make any progress in the second area. I was running in circles.I stopped playing and came back the next day. After some painful runs, I finally managed to move through the enemies\u2019 lines, dodging lasers in midair and never ceasing fire. I climbed all the way up a mountain, facing wave after wave of foes and traps as I made my way through. But all of a sudden, the chaos stopped.

I used all of the movement options at my disposal, carefully planning their execution. The music, which had been almost as quiet as the enemy before my arrival, quickly ramped up. All the while, the boss showcased its plethora of attacks, perhaps as a warning of what was to come. In one moment, a storm of projectiles would follow my toes. In another, the creature would fly quickly through the arena. During the battle\u2019s final phase, the enemy started attacking in close quarters in a much weaker stance, rampaging against the floor, producing shock waves with each hit, using whatever strength it had left.Seeing the boss struggling to stand on its feet as it tried to defeat me one more time symbolized what Returnal is about: It\u2019s a showcase of the toll that comes from repetition.This PlayStation 5 exclusive introduces itself as a third-person roguelike with set levels that reorient themselves in each run, across a total of six areas.

Each one has different passive skills that are unlocked purely by using the weapon, as well as an alternate fire that can be activated by pulling the DualSense\u2019s left trigger all the way down, instead of depressing it halfway to aim \u2014 a feature I loved.\n    Related\n  As for movement options, Selene can only jump once, and her dash is somewhat limited. While it allows you to dodge through almost all projectiles (as long as they\u2019re not purple), it has a hefty cooldown. In a game where split-second decisions can save you from a killing blow, the short wait until the dash becomes available again can feel eternal. It takes some time to get used to this, especially since the enemies aren\u2019t exactly patient about it.Item descriptions in roguelikes tend to consist merely of quick, catchy blurbs that are mysterious as they are unhelpful. Unfortunately, Returnal upholds that trope. It\u2019s rather annoying to see \u201cthis affects your dash\u201d reflected in a more colorful animation and not much else. Throwing yourself off a cliff or dashing toward an enemy attack on purpose aren\u2019t really good ways to test out an item, either, since you always have to be aware of your health.\n    Related\n  Then there are parasites, which grant a buff and a debuff, both of which are explained before you pick them up. It\u2019s an excellent idea on paper, but it quickly became more of a nuisance, as the drawbacks would often outweigh the benefits. These debuffs are also present in some items and chests, but unlike with the parasites, you have no idea what to expect there. Sometimes I got lucky, but in most cases I would get a debuff that significantly affected my run. I would always have the option to break free of it by completing a specific challenge, but there weren\u2019t many times that I was able to do that before dying.Toward the end of the game, I started to avoid parasites and items with possible debuffs altogether. I could rarely find reasons to risk my run in the mere hopes of getting an item or a cool buff. Some consumable items do help to mitigate harmful status effects, such as one that detaches parasites and another that eliminates all debuffs. The latter, for example, pushed me to go on a chest-opening spree before the next fight, and then I just used the item to undo my debuffs ahead of the battle. This dynamic was refreshing. I just wish items like this weren\u2019t so few and far between.I had to be smart about the risks I was willing to take in each run, and Selene\u2019s demeanor often matched how I was feeling. She faces uneven odds from the moment she sets foot on the planet, and that is clear in every encounter. It makes every victory significant, and revisiting past areas after learning the ropes feels immensely rewarding. But I was particularly impressed by the way Returnal portrays Selene\u2019s exhaustion, which gets elevated by the planet\u2019s cyclical nature.Every time Selene is defeated, she\u2019s taken back to the initial landing spot, a crash site where her ship lies broken into pieces. But before she\u2019s able to try again, a sequence of cutscenes appears on screen.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56070a9d-8e2d-4c39-88d5-d0667d552e26": {"__data__": {"id_": "56070a9d-8e2d-4c39-88d5-d0667d552e26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb9588df-b9f4-43a5-9715-c18ce98e305e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0a321e116360b2934adcef8a37c71d6dde5cd36b9814fc222033e581c699a06"}, "3": {"node_id": "d93aff2d-35ab-4fde-9b9c-85cccb0f5907", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee447c5246b7f72d252bd806ca0db7ea84e01ae2be5f885ca7261357557914cc"}}, "hash": "178ef4636dfdf2bb7c5f043a6f9006ce8cce1ffd89d6edca772eeccab0f22a9a", "text": "They replay the crash and Selene\u2019s arrival on this planet, but also display new events that begin to happen as the story unravels, making the flashback more poignant and terrifying with each death. These cutscenes tend to repeat themselves, but whenever I thought I knew what to expect, a new vision would shake me to the core, leaving me with even more questions about Selene\u2019s life before the crash.Desperation and uncertainty are ever-present feelings in each run of Returnal. They are there whenever Selene picks up a recording from the ground only to hear her own voice, relating events and thoughts that we as the player haven\u2019t seen yet. Perhaps even more terrifying are the moments when Selene finds her own body, time and time again, in different places. This loses some impact at the cost of adding a fun but gimmicky online component where you can find other players\u2019 corpses and trigger an optional fight if you choose to avenge them. Despite that, seeing Selene\u2019s body across some key locations after a couple of runs, often sitting in stillness, as if it had been shut down, becomes a scary constant.After defeating a few bosses, Selene finds a house that further toys around with these ideas. It did feel a bit reminiscent of P.T., but the visits were usually short enough and different enough from one another that I never tired of visiting the house. I won\u2019t spoil any of its surprises, so instead I\u2019ll say that it always left me with a wide range of emotions. Fear was the foundation, but there were story twists and even new momentary mechanics introduced there that took me by surprise and left me smiling at the screen, lost in a mix of confusion and admiration.Returnal\u2019s biggest achievement is the way it presents the horror of being stuck in place. It\u2019s bold and unapologetic in crafting its universe, making up for some of its more frustrating decisions by carving its own path and fulfilling its haunting potential. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard Selene fights; she\u2019s back in the same place with the same questions as before, if not more. The terror of fighting tooth and nail, seeing her suit covered in snow, mud, and sand, her visions tormenting her in her sleep \u2014 it stuck with me.After the 26 hours that it took me to see the final credits, I could relate to Selene\u2019s exhaustion. But by the time I was at the final boss, dodging hundreds of projectiles at once and side-eyeing my health bar, I felt consumed. I beat it with only one hit left on me, and I stood there watching the screen as I slowly regained my breath. All the while, Selene was in critical condition, as illustrated by a black-and-white filter, a flashing red signal on her suit, and a slow walk that reflected her injuries. I watched the final cutscene, waiting for a big revelation that would tie everything together, but the discovery was only one more piece of the puzzle. And I got sent back to the crash site, as ever.Even after more than 60 runs of Returnal, the enchanting presentation and sense of discovery still remain. I now feel vigorous compared to the creatures that have tried to defend their territory against an unwanted visitor. The last boss only took me one try to beat it, yet I could barely make any progress in finding the right answers. I feel like I\u2019m running in circles. But I\u2019m not giving up.

What makes it such a joy, whether in its original form on PlayStation or in this new PC version, is that being bad at it barely dents at its incredible appeal and overwhelming replayability.For those arriving afresh to 2021\u2019s PS5 title, this is Sony-owned Housemarque\u2019s exquisite combination of big-budget third-person shooter, with the sensibilities of an indie roguelite.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d93aff2d-35ab-4fde-9b9c-85cccb0f5907": {"__data__": {"id_": "d93aff2d-35ab-4fde-9b9c-85cccb0f5907", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "56070a9d-8e2d-4c39-88d5-d0667d552e26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "178ef4636dfdf2bb7c5f043a6f9006ce8cce1ffd89d6edca772eeccab0f22a9a"}, "3": {"node_id": "46d45cd9-07fc-4e52-8c34-250da8ed104a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ed6197e2aa593e3e0fe7bb461aaeba6f2263272a57c53bc8f89dc1e78f1f34e"}}, "hash": "ee447c5246b7f72d252bd806ca0db7ea84e01ae2be5f885ca7261357557914cc", "text": "Which is to say, every time you die at the hands of the writhing alien horrors, you start right back at the crash site of your spaceship, your progress lost, but for the permanent upgrades and improvements you\u2019ve perhaps made in previous runs.Selene Vassos is a space pilot whose ship crashes on Atropos, after she goes rogue in her pursuit of something called the White Shadow signal. But on her very first venture out into the overgrown ruins of the area, she discovers\u2026her own dead body. There are recordings she\u2019s previously created and left for herself to hear, seemingly aware that at certain points she loses her memory. Then on your first time dying at the hands tentacles of a local monster, you find yourself reliving the crash before awakening back on your ship. It\u2019s a time loop, and one where the planet you\u2019re on reshapes itself each time you set out.And set out again you will, the game\u2019s difficulty set deliberately high, such that in your earliest runs you\u2019re close to helpless, given your lack of a melee weapon, the potato gun you begin with, and the way the doors keep locking behind you, sealing you in enormous arenas with a vast, red lion-octopus thing that pins you down as it tears you into chunks. And yet you keep going. And going. And going, getting slightly better at the game, while being rewarded with slightly better starting equipment. Perhaps a bonus item that heals you, or something to skewer enemies with spikes, or it could be entirely new traversal equipment.What\u2019s so important about all of this\u2014even if you\u2019re someone (like me) averse to the whole Dark Souls scourge on gaming, and who would rather belly-flop onto railings than do yet another boss fight\u2014is that it\u2019s so outrageously compelling. Both in 2021, and today, this is a game that always feels eminently fair, where every failure is entirely on you, and yet constantly gives you the feeling that next time, next time you\u2019ll get it. You don\u2019t. In fact, you do far worse than last time. But you laugh it off, and head out yet again, because goddammit, it\u2019s just so much fun to play.OK, so obviously if you\u2019re familiar with the game, what you want to know most of all right now is how does it hold up on PC? The joyful answer is: tremendously. This is unquestionably a very demanding game, and I feared that I would need to reduce my computer\u2019s setup to be more in line with the far lower television resolutions and scales a console demands, but none of that was true.My PC is pretty decent, although ever-more modest: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X, 32GB RAM, with a GeForce RTX 3070. It\u2019s usually able to run most games close to full specs, albeit with the fancier bells and whistles toned down. Returnal informed me it wanted to run things at \u201cEpic,\u201d about which I was somewhat dubious, before realizing it was intending to do this at 3440x1440. Ha, yeah, sure. And then it did. And for the most part, it\u2019s delivered that at a pretty solid 55-60FPS. Which has blown me away\u2014aren\u2019t these console ports supposed to chug along at 25FPS on minimum settings until at least the third patch?I say for the most part, because I have had a couple of moments of slowdown, extremely busy scenes where framerates have noticeably dropped, or where the GPU usage has spiked so high my whole PC starts to groan. But these have been rare, and let\u2019s not forget I\u2019m running the whole thing at full specs, in ultra-widescreen. (It even offers support for 32:9 Super Ultrawide, should you have a monitor that mad.) Of course, that\u2019s my PC, and I don\u2019t have the facilities to do wider testing\u2014your mileage may vary, and with any PC release, there are hardware combinations that meet issues.If you want to get hardcore with your hardware, Returnal PC offers a wealth of toggles, including NVidia\u2019s DLSS and NIS, and AMD\u2019s FSR, to boost framerates, along with options for ray-traced shadows and reflections, if you really like it when your GPU starts to wheeze. Beyond this, you can tweak every detail of lighting, environmental details, and post-processing options, with the option to have FPS, CPU, GPU, temperatures and RAM use all live on screen while you\u2019re perfecting your setup.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46d45cd9-07fc-4e52-8c34-250da8ed104a": {"__data__": {"id_": "46d45cd9-07fc-4e52-8c34-250da8ed104a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "d93aff2d-35ab-4fde-9b9c-85cccb0f5907", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ee447c5246b7f72d252bd806ca0db7ea84e01ae2be5f885ca7261357557914cc"}, "3": {"node_id": "9184637d-9d9c-4815-a12b-fedfd3c9e5e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d7d7732aedbd096438b2c8885f238a06d8553871b122b4d773f8b31a7ae3e50"}}, "hash": "7ed6197e2aa593e3e0fe7bb461aaeba6f2263272a57c53bc8f89dc1e78f1f34e", "text": "It really is a master class in how to deliver a top-end game to PC users, somewhat ironically coming from a console company.Oh, and if you want to get the full experience, you can hook up a PS5 DualSense controller to your PC, and get all the same haptic feedback and trigger witchcraft that comes with the console version. Personally, I opted to play mouse/keyboard, having already spent a ludicrous number of hours playing the PS5 version, and really appreciated the far greater aiming precision of God\u2019s own gaming setup. With dash on Shift and melee on middle mouse, there wasn\u2019t really anything to miss but for the haptic sensation of rain falling all around me.This PC port also offers co-op play, and the endless challenge mode of the Tower of Sisyphus, so it\u2019s pretty much identical to the PS5\u2019s version, just at resolutions that\u2019ll make your console chums cry into their controllers.I\u2019m really pleased to have returned to Returnal, even if it has been a lesson in just how awful I am at the game. It\u2019s just so much fun to play, even when you\u2019re failing, and that\u2019s a rare and precious thing\u2014something too often forgotten in gaming since the days of the arcade. Goodness me, if I had to stick in another quarter every time I lost, I\u2019d be flat-broke by now, and happy about it.Returnal drip-feeds you progress just often enough to leave you feeling like progress is always achievable, but at a pace slow enough that you do something more important: get better at it through practice. Enemies that felt impossibly deadly at the start become brushed aside not because you\u2019ve now got a vast arsenal of weapons and seventy times more health\u2014you just don\u2019t\u2014but because you got good at beating them. That\u2019s a tremendously satisfying experience.In fact, the whole game is a tremendously satisfying experience. From the wonderful alien design, to the slow-burning storyline and its blank-faced staring astronaut, to the satisfying array of weapons, and perhaps most importantly, to the way the statues crumble when you hit them, this is something utterly solid, and eternally compelling. And unless my rig proves a fluke, finally a console-to-PC port to celebrate on day one.\nKotaku, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve felt it too. For the past year and some change, life has fallen into a rut more than usual. Life is always cyclical to some degree\u2014humans are, after all, creatures of habit\u2014but the stresses that go hand-in-hand with a certain mismanaged pandemic have made the day-to-day feel more dreary and cyclical than ever. Returnal, an action game out tomorrow for PlayStation 5, captures that sensation in a bottle.To play Returnal is to subject yourself to repeated lessons in failure. Every time you play, you\u2019ll do the same thing, except slightly different, except the same, really. You might, at the end of a session, walk away with the inexorable, all-consuming notion that everything is futile, that nothing will ultimately change, and that it\u2019s just not worth it, man.Good thing the game is such a blast.Let\u2019s start with the basics: Returnal is a sci-fi action game with a heavy focus on shooting and laser-precise traversal. Developed by Housemarque\u2014a Finnish studio best known for slick bullet-hell shooters of the side-scrolling (Resogun) or top-down (Nex Machina) variety\u2014Returnal notably features a third-person perspective viewed over the shoulder. At any given moment, enemies swarm your position, filling the screen with a barrage of iridescent orbs. You can only survive a handful of hits, so you have to dodge this sea of neon by jumping or dashing. (Later on, you can use a grappling hook to zip across levels and out of danger.) You fight back with an arsenal of standard-issue video game weapons: pistols, shotguns, rifles, launchers, and one seriously kickass alien sword.You play Selene Vassos, an interstellar scout working for a space agency called Astra. Returnal opens with Selene approaching Atropos, an uncharted planet.

Huh. Moving on. Astra protocol dictates that Selene can only be rescued if she reaches a far-off radio signal, so her one and only priority is figuring out how to get there.On your journey you\u2019ll jump and dash and shoot your way through various biomes\u2014including that waterlogged forest, an arid desert, and a decrepit, long-abandoned metropolis set amid an orange-hued wasteland that looks like something out of Blade Runner 2049\u2014littered with the shattered remnants of an apparently dead civilization referred to only as \u201cthe sentients.\u201d The placement and order of these biomes remains the same each game, but each one\u2019s layout, loot, and enemy contingents are procedurally generated.

Death is always a bit disorienting. In rare instances, you\u2019ll wake up in the cockpit of the Helios, one of the few moments when the game switches to a first-person perspective. More often, you wake up in the dirt. Returnal doesn\u2019t have a start screen or menu. Whether you\u2019re booting up the game or respawning from your latest death, a smash-cut version of the opening cinematic plays out.Yes, Returnal is yet another time-loop game. The past few years of fiction have featured so many recursively structured stories that I sometimes feel like I\u2019m in a time loop of time loops, but Returnal tees up a novel approach. Often, the time-loop story kicks off at the start of the cycle, but Returnal throws you into the thick of it. I, as Selene, may have died nearly 70 times so far. It\u2019s impossible to calculate how many times she died before I entered the picture and became singularly responsible for her life and wellbeing.So that\u2019s the thought exercise at the core of Returnal: What do you do when you realize you\u2019re not just stuck in a time loop but have possibly been stuck in it for an indeterminable length of time? And, in the face of that realization, how do you motivate yourself to keep going?\u201cI\u2019ll make it this time,\u201d Selene says after standing up for what feels like the millionth time. I don\u2019t believe her at all, mostly because I don\u2019t believe in myself.Returnal is, without question, the most challenging game I\u2019ve played in a long time. The enemies are relentless, and you\u2019re quite fragile.Enemies in Returnal don\u2019t retreat or cower behind cover. They\u2019re constantly pushing your position, raining\u2014torrentially downpouring, more like\u2014projectiles your way. Some foes create laser-beam rings that ripple outward. Others can summon tendrils to snag your feet, slowing your movement. There are also turrets everywhere, many of which have shields you can only break with a melee attack. Trying to keep track of this all while also shooting enemies is a lot to juggle. Returnal forces you to learn how its patterns work, to respawn and try again, armed with knowledge gained through the fire of trial and error.But also, absolutely fuck some of these fucking enemies into the fucking sun. I\u2019d like to call out the bats specifically. (They\u2019re technically called Lamiadons, but, look, \u201cbats\u201d rolls off the tongue better.) Returnal never feels cheap, mostly because Selene\u2019s movement is more finely tuned than a baby grand under the purview of the New York Philharmonic. But the bats have really tested my patience. Survival in Returnal is largely contingent on dodging projectiles. Bats, instead, full-body barrel into you, seemingly without warning, completely flipping the script you\u2019re handed at the start. As I eloquently put it in a Kotaku Slack channel, \u201cTHE BATS ARE THE WORST.\u201dReturnal gives you a snappy toolkit to take on enemies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8a735aa-f010-4269-96a5-071b6350cc47": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8a735aa-f010-4269-96a5-071b6350cc47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "9184637d-9d9c-4815-a12b-fedfd3c9e5e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d7d7732aedbd096438b2c8885f238a06d8553871b122b4d773f8b31a7ae3e50"}, "3": {"node_id": "34549358-a75e-4808-b108-2baaac7420dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c834fc785cba862f2516a6a77862f1fbadf1d6ba0adbeb1ec08d1bfe513c810"}}, "hash": "48bb7bb1798c4e6a638aaf24e7dfad0a8f73fd6ff4c5faac22f1a651e57bdd2e", "text": "When you dash, you\u2019re fully invulnerable, so instead of moving as far and as fast as possible away from projectiles, it\u2019s often more beneficial to dodge toward\u2014and even through\u2014them. You\u2019re invincible (momentarily)! You can take it, so long as your timing is sound.The game also features a unique approach to alternate-fire modes. Every weapon features a secondary fire, a cooldown-tied ability that can vary from a proximity mine to a single-use grenade to a Palpatine-esque stream of lightning. In the default control scheme you don\u2019t activate this with a button. Instead, while aiming down the sights, you\u2019ll feel the left trigger tense up, a haptic innovation you\u2019d only find in the PS5\u2019s controller. Pushing past that tension activates the secondary fire, at which point you\u2019d then need to pull the right trigger to fire. (You can switch this to a more traditional scheme in the game\u2019s settings.)Less of a trip, at least for those who\u2019ve played Gears of War, is the reloading mechanic. You don\u2019t have any ammo reserves. Weapon clips on Atropos automatically recharge, but if you empty a clip, you need to time a reloading mini-game. Your clip\u2014which is displayed directly under your reticule, so you can\u2019t miss it\u2014will turn into a rightward-moving slider; stop it at the right spot, and you\u2019ll instantly reload. (The target stopping point varies in width at an apparently random basis.) Time it wrong, and your gun will jam for a second. It\u2019s yet one more element to keep track of amid the onslaught, constantly keeping you on your toes. Upon death, yes, Returnal always sends you back to the beginning of the loop. As with all roguelikes and roguelike-likes, dying is so, so frustrating. I mean, you found so many health upgrades! And, man, you had the best gun! Really, how could you possibly lose when you lucked into that rare revival item? Uggghhh.Not all is lost. Returnal features a handful of permanent upgrades that carry between runs. Whenever you unlock a new weapon\u2014typically at or near the start of each unlocked biome\u2014that weapon stands a chance of spawning in your next run. Same rules apply to consumable items and artifacts (accessories that grant you a bonus for the duration of that life). Still, you start every run fresh, with nothing more than a pistol and your reserves of a single type of currency that, in the game\u2019s mythos, transcends timelines.Returnal features classic roguelike elements like \u201cHow\u2019s this for a twist on Groundhog Day?\u201d and \u201cNice loadout you\u2019ve got there, it\u2019d be a shame if something\u2026happened to it.\u201d But it also makes some more unusual choices. For one thing, you only have to defeat each boss once. So, for instance, after your first kill of Phrike (the first biome\u2019s boss), on every future run you can skip that fight and head directly to the Crimson Wastes, provided you survive the first biome\u2019s arboreal trek. But boss fights tend to give you some sweet upgrades. So do you take on the boss\u2014who\u2019s more likely to kill you compared to the cannon fodder\u2014for the chance of nabbing some powerful gear? Or do you play things safe and skip the fight?You also don\u2019t have to trek through every biome each run. Once you defeat Ixion, the boss of the Crimson Wastes, you\u2019ll earn a permanent upgrade that allows you to directly access the third biome, the Derelict Citadel. This poses a similar quandary. You could take the time to fight through both the first and second biomes, picking up silphium resin (health upgrades) and parasites (double-edged equippable bonuses) along the way, all in the effort to prepare yourself as best as possible for the punishing third biome. Or you could skip the Crimson Wastes altogether and beeline to the Derelict Citadel.A brief detour into some mid-game story spoilers:Spoilers follow for the doozy of a mid-game twist in Returnal.

Dammit.There are six biomes in Returnal. As far as I\u2019ve seen, once you broach this halfway point, every death returns you to the start of the fourth biome, which bears a stark resemblance to the first but is still very much its own deal. In other words, in any given run, you only have to make your way through three biomes (or two, if you, like me, are equal parts impatient and cautious). As far as twists go, it blew my mind\u2014in terms of both narrative and structure. It\u2019s also the one thing I would\u2019ve loved a heads up about before diving into the game. Were I not playing this for review, I can\u2019t say for sure I would\u2019ve powered through; the sheer thought of making it through six lengthy biomes in one run sounded impossible. Three? Well, that\u2019s easier to swallow.Spoilers over.

Also the dialogue veers into melodrama.HousemarquePS5April 30, 2021Over the course of 33 hours and 20 minutes, explored 214 areas in five biomes, died 69 times (nice), killed 3,768 hostile monsters, performed 308 overloads, suffered 55 suit malfunctions, attached 37 parasites to my nervous system, and experienced one existential crisis.As mentioned, Returnal is one of the more challenging games I\u2019ve played in recent times; as I write this, I\u2019m still hacking away at the fifth biome, whose mini-boss keeps stealing my lunch money and wedgieing me to death. It\u2019s also one of the most well-crafted. I\u2019m still trying to unlock some obvious, Metroid-style upgrades, like the ability to swim in pools of water I\u2019ve passed. I haven\u2019t seen how vestigial story threads play out. And yet, I feel fully confident in saying that Returnal is well worth checking out.Of the many things Returnal does right, few top the boss fights, each of which is both a puzzle and a challenge. Broken into three progressively intense waves, you have to dodge literally hundreds of projectiles while trying to line up shots on the boss, usually centrally located in the arena. You might master the first two waves, and still get eviscerated by the third. Back to the drawing board, and the start of the game.Weaponry in Returnal is totally randomized. There are 10 weapons types and 10 secondary fire modes that can slot onto any weapon. Defeating a boss is partially contingent on memorizing patterns, but it\u2019s also a matter of luck: While working through biomes, will you get one of the weapon pairings fit for that particular boss fight? Or will you be stuck with a dinky pistol?While bashing my head against the fourth biome\u2019s boss, I repeatedly never found anything better than a dinky pistol. I learned the patterns, but I couldn\u2019t deal enough damage to make a difference. Every time I tried, I\u2019d make it to the third wave and die within seconds, focusing too much on landing my weak shots rather than effectively dodging the volleyball-sized orbs of space goo.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a19e170-fd34-4ebe-84a8-dd8990e0ac88": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a19e170-fd34-4ebe-84a8-dd8990e0ac88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "34549358-a75e-4808-b108-2baaac7420dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c834fc785cba862f2516a6a77862f1fbadf1d6ba0adbeb1ec08d1bfe513c810"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c89af92-8c93-4263-b6a7-ae74048a5125", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "09878ee18b278da3160dd969e86c59e8449261a0f08c07b0631e86d1efa4ff46"}}, "hash": "d0b76346da8938c68d7662d379818b1d77a2554c6602091e503b058f55b37a03", "text": "Then I got lucky and found a weapon called the hollowseeker, which doesn\u2019t deal much damage per individual bullet but does have a blistering fire rate and a nearly bottomless clip.

Throughout the first biome, you\u2019ll come across a mid-century house. Usually, you can\u2019t interact with it at all, but after beating a boss, you\u2019ll see the porch light flicker during the following run, at which point you can walk right in. The game pivots from third- to first-person and the pace slows to a crawl without releasing any tension. You can\u2019t sprint or shoot. You can only pick up and put down various mundane objects\u2014pill bottles, laptops, cereal boxes, rejection letters.It\u2019s not worth spoiling what happens in these sections, as they\u2019re brief, rare, and consistently astonishing. I\u2019ll just say this: Before the game came out, a series of screenshots and concept art pieces suggested that nothing in Returnal would be more nightmare-inducing than the local creatures. Every monster in this game is a breathing nightmare, no doubt, but I\u2019ve found the sections in the house\u2014the quiet moments when you\u2019re exploring\u2014to be far more frightful. The monsters\u2019 hellish screeching might unsettle, but, ultimately, you know what they\u2019ll do. When you\u2019re in the farmhouse, and hear footsteps inauspiciously plod upstairs, you have no clue what\u2019ll happen.Returnal feels like a next-gen game. Take a peep:The game is freakin\u2019 gorgeous. You get the standard next-gen fidelity benchmarks\u20144K resolution and a framerate of 60 frames per second\u2014but the beauty of Returnal is more than mere numbers. It\u2019s how moonlight peeks through the forest canopy, or how blue-tendril fauna arcs toward Selene in moments of respite. It\u2019s the way snow shuffles in the wind. It\u2019s the way fog parts as you stroll through buried tombs. Returnal moves at a brisk pace, but I\u2019ve spent long moments just standing still, drinking in the sights.I\u2019d further go on a limb and say that, at the moment, Returnal is debatably the fastest-loading big-budget video game out right now. You can cold boot\u2014or go from clicking on Returnal\u2019s dashboard tile icon to playing the game\u2014in under 20 seconds. Fast-traveling within one biome doesn\u2019t trigger a loading screen. Even moving between zones barely registers a load. If you look closely, you\u2019ll see a minor blip while sprinting between two biomes. For all intents and purposes it\u2019s a seamless transition. Seriously, get a load of this:The haptics, too, are unlike anything I\u2019ve felt in a PS5 game. There\u2019s that trigger-tension alt-fire thing, which feels fantastically tactile. Even the vibrations are more subtle and varied than other games I\u2019ve played on PS5. Somehow, developers at Housemarque were able to replicate the pitter-patter of rainfall so that, when it rains in the game, your controller mimics the rhythm and intensity, as if you were holding your hands out, palms up, in an April shower. That\u2019s not to say other PS5 games haven\u2019t previously made use of the DualSense\u2019s haptics. There\u2019s just a world of difference between using them in the most literal sense (get hit, take damage, controller rumbles) and using them in creative, savvy, eye-opening ways like Returnal often does.Last fall, Astro\u2019s Playroom arguably made the strongest case for the next generation of video game consoles. As a pre-installed game on every PS5\u2014typically the sort of thing you\u2019d either ignore or delete\u2014Astro pulled double duty as a solid platformer and as a built-in technical demonstration for what the DualSense controller could do.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c89af92-8c93-4263-b6a7-ae74048a5125": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c89af92-8c93-4263-b6a7-ae74048a5125", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a19e170-fd34-4ebe-84a8-dd8990e0ac88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0b76346da8938c68d7662d379818b1d77a2554c6602091e503b058f55b37a03"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c38ff19-254d-47a4-8eb3-95b9084d504c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb001f50dfeb9186f7298a0f169979e8d9073d1bb064db87b04a19c33fee8115"}}, "hash": "09878ee18b278da3160dd969e86c59e8449261a0f08c07b0631e86d1efa4ff46", "text": "It was a neat game, the general consensus suggested, but served more as a harbinger for what PS5 games could really do. Just gotta wait for one to come along. Returnal is that game. That\u2019s not to say Returnal isn\u2019t devoid of archaic bullshit, nor to absolve Returnal of said bullshit. Exhibit A: There is no official way to save and quit out of the game. A run in Returnal can last hours, especially if you\u2019re combing through every room in every biome for as many resources as you can scrounge up. That you can\u2019t save your game and pivot to something else smacks of a design decision from a prior, less accommodating era of gaming. If, for whatever reason, your PS5 turns off, you\u2019re screwed, out potentially hours of carefully earned progress.(Speaking personally, my apartment has a curious setup where the living room power is tied to a light switch that rests at head level above our sofa. Sometimes, people accidentally lean into this switch, turning off the power for everything in the room, including my PS5. Thankfully, that hasn\u2019t happened while I\u2019ve been playing Returnal, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t plagued with anxiety about that possibility while knee-deep in a solid run.)I can\u2019t even begin to see the logic behind this strange decision. In a reviewer\u2019s guide provided to Kotaku, Sony, Returnal\u2019s publisher, suggested using the PS5\u2019s \u201crest mode\u201d as a workaround. You can pause the game at any point, and putting the console into \u201crest\u201d will suspend your game. In my experience, this trick hasn\u2019t failed. But I\u2019m an edge case, having devoted nearly every hour of my free time over the past nine days toward playing this game. Most players likely won\u2019t be in that position. Off the top of my head, I\u2019m thinking of people who share a PS5, or people who work erratic schedules, or people who can otherwise only play video games in sporadic bursts. At the end of the day, designing the game without a save function at all sure feels like a callous choice meant to wring attention from players who might not always have that attention to spare.When asked whether or not save functionality will be implemented in the future, representatives for Housemarque said the company is focused on Returnal\u2019s launch and that there are no \u201cfurther plans to announce at this time.\u201dDuring one stellar run\u2014I made it to the fifth biome (!!!) without taking a single hit\u2014I tripped.I held my left thumbstick maybe three degrees too far to the right, and stepped directly into a bottomless pool of 33\u00ba F water. This didn\u2019t kill me\u2014I respawned in the same room with a third of my health bar missing\u2014but it sure threw me off my game. (It also reset my \u201cadrenaline\u201d meter, which is basically a kill-streak that grants you bonus effects, like increased melee damage, for consecutively taking out enemies without getting hit). Sure enough, within a few rooms, I died. Set yourself up for success all you want. Nothing can compensate for a sudden and total loss of momentum.I tried to imagine what Selene was thinking in that moment. I got nothing. She dies too quickly. Then she wakes up. She dusts herself off. She\u2019s ready to go\u2014or not. There\u2019s always tomorrow, which, for her, will be the same as today, and the next day, and every day.Last month, in an essay for The Atlantic, Devon Powers, an associate professor at Temple University, addressed the \u201cconstrained yet predictable rhythm\u201d many of us surely feel every day.\u201cThis little world is equal parts dull and intense; everyone I know is sad, exhausted, antsy, and resigned,\u201d Powers wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to leave these confines behind, and yet this world is mine.\u201dAs you repeatedly make your way through Atropos, you\u2019ll find Selene\u2019s deceased remains, presumably left behind in previous attempts to escape.

There\u2019s always tomorrow..\nGame Revolution, \nBy\n\nMack Ashworth \nReturnal for PC untethers the game from its PS5 exclusive constraints, unlocking better controls with keyboard and mouse, higher frame rates and flexible resolution options including super ultrawide 32:9, and bumps up the visual quality to an even higher standard. PS5 owners might have been first to play this mysterious bullet hell roguelike, but PC players get to enjoy it in its definitive state.Returnal is one of those shooters that benefits enormously from PC performance and peripherals. The more frames you can get, the smoother the experience, and the more fluid and responsive movement and aiming become. Though a DualSense controller is supported, it\u2019d be foolish to forgo the accuracy and versatility of a keyboard and mouse. Playing Returnal on PS5 with the DualSense was immersive, sure, but I found myself forced to use weapons with homing properties, so as to alleviate some of the frustration that comes with using analog sticks to aim. On PC, every weapon feels lethal thanks to the mouse.While most players will opt for lower visual quality to keep the frame rates as high as possible, those with higher-end systems can use their investment to make Returnal look sublime. The alien environments come alive with the generous number of graphics options all cranked to the max, and Returnal quickly cements itself as one of the best-looking games out there.Most environments are darker which contrasts brilliantly with the neon-lit attacks. Newcomers may find it tough to track and dodge enemy bullets with the sheer number of particles on screen but, as is the case for most bullet hell games, experience over time will make encounters easier to read and less overwhelming. Just get used to dying a lot, as this game leans heavily into trial and error.Aiding low to mid-tier hardware are the many upscaling options. The developer has confirmed that DLSS 3.0 and FSR 2 are on their way in a future update, but players can already make use of smart upscaling to gain additional performance. This is a huge benefit to those holding off upgrading their PC and trying to get a couple more years out of their current specs.Following a patch deployed close to the game\u2019s launch, performance has been smooth 99% of the time for my 3700X/3070/32 GB rig. This is largely due to the exceptional graphics options menu, which overlays the gameplay and immediately showcases changes. This pairs with the superb benchmarking run to make honing in on perfect settings as simple as possible. The other 1% of the time, performance suffers from occasional hitches when moving between areas. This is also present on the PS5 version and, after a few hours, you do get used to it. It normally isn\u2019t an issue, as I\u2019m rarely in combat when moving quickly between rooms, but on the rare occasion where it does hiccup during a fight, it can be very frustrating. Avoiding hits is a huge part of Returnal\u2019s gameplay as it impacts both weapon enhancements and maximum health, so any performance problems become extremely noticeable.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc4f366f-9283-4f68-b6f5-aeed748c897a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc4f366f-9283-4f68-b6f5-aeed748c897a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c38ff19-254d-47a4-8eb3-95b9084d504c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb001f50dfeb9186f7298a0f169979e8d9073d1bb064db87b04a19c33fee8115"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba6efdf2-099f-4bb3-b56a-4f902c26b2b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38db05738dd00bf62cd9b02e96f2ffe8d80b10d34cb637bd5287a39caedb7ed8"}}, "hash": "5a396170558d0c86892214933f9b6220d9fdfbfb824d3f5f5623d050a4063aca", "text": "Once keyboard and mouse controls are configured and graphics settings are fine-tuned, the planet of Atropos awaits players. There are mysteries to be discovered around every corner and it\u2019s this curiosity for story progression, while getting more powerful gear, that will keep players engaged with this roguelike. Not only are there alien enemies, but the environments themselves have their own unexpected characteristics, alongside pickups that can be either a help or a hindrance.This roguelike demands trial and error not just through its challenging combat, but also in the items players pick up. It\u2019s easy to accidentally nerf yourself for the next few encounters, making for an extra layer of danger when deciding which alien artifacts to equip or to outright avoid.There\u2019s a surprising amount of story to absorb in Returnal, though much of it is open to interpretation through the symbols and hints laced throughout the game. Even the main character, Selene, is shrouded in mystery and not entirely trustworthy as a narrator. This horror show quickly turns into a psychological thriller and I found the downtime between fights, where you learn that little more about what\u2019s going on, very compelling. However, for those who just want to shoot things, perhaps with a buddy, the Tower of Sisyphus mode is the place to let loose. This is where the Returnal\u2019s longevity lies. It cuts out the story and replaces it with endless waves of enemies and the upgrades needed to help deal with them.Thanks to a recent patch that fixed the majority of performance issues that I was having, I can happily call Returnal on PC the \u201cdefinitive version.\u201d It has the looks, the performance, and the best controls, ready to reward those who waited for the PS5\u2019s timed-exclusivity period to end with a compelling, mysterious story and top-tier bullet hell gameplay. 9Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Although still technically an indie studio, Housemarque is changing that through Returnal, its Sony-published AAA roguelite shooter. Even though this is a departure for the Finnish developer and different take on the genre, it\u2019s easily the team\u2019s best and most well-realized game and an overall brilliant experience.Returnal is a unique roguelite, but it still follows the rules that its two-dimensional counterparts have established. Dying or closing the game returns players to the starting point and forfeits all of the non-permanent items earned along the way. Levels, gear, and upgrades are procedurally compiled together to make each run different. And, since it is a roguelite and not a roguelike, there are a small handful of persistent upgrades that either make successive bouts a touch easier or unlock other areas of the map, Metroid-style.From the most basic standpoint, Returnal doesn\u2019t stray too far from genre staples, but it still uses that traditional framework to great effect. Almost everything in the game is some sort of risk or choice. Cursed chests, heath packs, or crystal clusters may yield powerful rewards, but could also unleash a malfunction; a risk that can be prematurely bypassed by spending a rare currency used for obtaining new stuff or a life-saving revive. Challenge rooms are difficult, but yield grand rewards upon completion. Attachable parasites boost some stats while harming other ones.The game is intelligently designed in a way to push players to take risks and make their experience more interesting as the difficulty is stacked against those who play it safe. An easier game would be less exciting. Constantly weighing those dangers while also picking through the vast array of weapons and upgrades also ensures that no two runs feel similar.The loop of starting fresh and seeing what mix of guns and gear the RNG gods have sprinkled around is an addictive treat, given the possibilities the ocean of variables grants players. And this ocean gets even deeper as the roguelite elements come into play and unlock progressively more mods, weapons, consumables, and more, further sweetening the loop as the hours fly by. Unfortunately, levels layouts aren\u2019t as diverse and comparatively start repeating quite soon in a way that the items never do.The combat puts the arsenal of gear to the test and is where the game comes into its own. It\u2019s a fast-paced third-person shooter with the amount of precision that would make PlatinumGames jealous.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba6efdf2-099f-4bb3-b56a-4f902c26b2b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba6efdf2-099f-4bb3-b56a-4f902c26b2b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc4f366f-9283-4f68-b6f5-aeed748c897a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a396170558d0c86892214933f9b6220d9fdfbfb824d3f5f5623d050a4063aca"}, "3": {"node_id": "410df8ad-23d2-46df-994b-0372327c0462", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "00dbce5be9d5c2b481f8fc4c7de22ac1aec453d0e7ddf765d64530649e6d0a7d"}}, "hash": "38db05738dd00bf62cd9b02e96f2ffe8d80b10d34cb637bd5287a39caedb7ed8", "text": "An air dash, generous dodge, a blazing fast sprint speed, and a sparse amount of recovery frames give players the ultimate control over Selene, the protagonist, as she zips around slaying all sorts of aliens and robots that fill the screen with large projectiles and explosions.It\u2019s demanding, but routinely fulfilling because of the tightness of the controls, utility of the weapons, rock-solid high frame rate, and intuitive use of the DualSense\u2019s adaptive triggers. Housemarque hasn\u2019t made a third-person shooter like this before, but its work making responsive arcade games has truly paid off and translated to this new genre phenomenally well.Returnal\u2019s combat would be exceptional in a standard third-person shooter, but it\u2019s made even better by its roguelite half and vice versa. Since the shooting is so satisfying by itself, it\u2019s natural to want to do it over and over again in a replayable setting. And the engrossing roguelite loop of unlocking more stuff is improved because of the astonishingly smooth combat that\u2019s required to get those unlocks. Rewarding shooting begets more rewarding unlocks which begets more rewarding shooting and that symbiotic process repeats over and over again \u2014 ironically \u2014 without feeling repetitive. It\u2019s a perfect storm of intrinsic and extrinsic incentives.Returnal\u2019s world is about as unique and awe-inspiring as its gameplay, too. Each of its six biomes are radically different from one another, but are common in their truly alien feel. These places are so foreign and are not only riddled with bizarre extraterrestrial flora and fauna, but also gigantic statues and structures that belong to a mysterious sentient alien race not too unlike the space jockeys in Ridley Scott\u2019s Alien (sans all the phallic imagery).Fusing together technology and buildings from such otherworldly sources provides the constant sense of wonder that good sci-fi has \u2014 an aspect that becomes even more clear as the game leans more into its Lovecraftian inspirations. The Interstellar-esque soundtrack also further reinforces this mood and is equally chilling and breathtaking as the visuals it complements, creating an unforgettable and consistent audiovisual presentation.The game\u2019s world and roguelite nature are even justified in its story. Selene finds herself after she\u2019s crashed on an alien planet and is reborn after every death for some unknown reason. And if that wasn\u2019t absurd enough, she also stumbles upon audio logs of herself that she doesn\u2019t remember recording.The premise is an inherently engaging central mystery that seamlessly works in tandem with its mechanics and provides a narrative incentive to progress further in the loop to get some answers. Like Hades, additional story bits are even unlocked after dying as more recordings and alien tablets litter the newly configured environment. Listening to the journeys of all the other Selenes is unsettling as the logs slowly get darker and darker and further ratchets up the intrigue.Like its gameplay, Returnal\u2019s story is not force-fed to the player. It\u2019s semi-Lynchian in its approach as a lot of its narrative is implied, found in audiotapes, or told in fragments or flashbacks. Very little of it seems to be an objective fact and is instead meant for players to infer their own meaning from the beats it presents. And while a more traditional presentation would have been more digestible, Returnal gives players enough to chew on to be gratifying in its vagueness, especially considering its dark, ambiguous ending. Understanding everything isn\u2019t the point as the process of soaking in its tone and reflecting on the emotions it evokes can be as valuable as a more conventionally told tale.However, Returnal is unambiguously and thoroughly an outstanding game. Mixing the RPG progression and ever-evolving suite of roguelite hooks with a frenetic third-person shooter results in a new experience with two halves that make each other better. As it did with the PS3, Vita, and PS4, Housemarque has once again provided Sony with another launch-era hit and in doing so has created a rewarding, replayable, and revolutionary game that\u2019s hopefully the foundation for other future AAA titles that are as clever with the roguelite blueprint.GameRevolution reviewed Returnal on PS5.

Is it worth (gulp) $70? It really depends on your penchant for roguelikes.Returnal\u00a0(PS5) Developer: Housemarque Publisher: Sony Released: April 30, 2021 MSRP: $69.99Housemarque is back and I\u2019m into it. Ever since Super Stardust HD\u00a0they immediately appeared on my radar and haven\u2019t left ever since. While people are quick to point out more well-known games like Resogun\u00a0when talking about The House, I\u2019m particularly fond of a few of their lesser-known titles like Outland, which was a fantastic take on Ikaruga\u00a0meets platforming.This time around the studio is reinventing itself with a third-person shooter roguelike/roguelite. The latter bit is important, because like Hades, you\u2019re going to be keeping permanent upgrades, and in the case of Returnal, shortcuts. So if you loathe the idea of \u201cstarting all over\u201d upon every death or failed run, that\u2019s not as much of a concern here. The gimmick involves a very Prometheus-esque setup of a woman (Selene) crash-landing on an alien planet filled with creatures that would make\u00a0H.R. Giger squirm.Every time Selene dies, she appears right back at the crash site, and needs to figure out why she\u2019s there; amid a bit of coming to terms with personal trauma added in for good measure. As a result, Selene feels more like a character than a lot of similar genre staples, but there is a good degree of subtlety to avoid Returnal\u00a0descending into cloying shlock.Mechanically, you\u2019ll get to your eventual endpoint by huffing it and air dashing through a handful of biomes, as you upgrade both an in-run track (that you lose after death) and an overarching permanent track. It takes some getting used to, but the adaptive triggers and rumble are neatly used here, allowing for regular fire if you slightly press down on L2 to aim, and alt-fire if you slam down hard. Each biome pits you against a big boss at the end, then you move to the next biome, get more upgrades, and try your luck again.[brid video=\u201d770592\u2033 player=\u201d12899\u2033 title=\u201dReturnal%20Review\u201d duration=\u201d258\u2033 description=\u201dDestructoid\u2019s review of Returnal.We\u2019re NOT taking a look at a new Wicca Phase Springs Eternal album, but a video game named Returnal from Housemarque for the PS5.

Returnal\u00a0doesn\u2019t feel overly oppressive for the sake of it, as enemies can be handled through pure skill and twitch action and don\u2019t have many opportunities to cheese or otherwise one-shot players so long as you have situational awareness.Weapons also pack a punch, as do the vast majority of upgrades. Returnal\u00a0uses a clever risk-reward system too, which can grant you access to better equipment if you chance\u00a0that a marked item might give you a \u201cmalfunction\u201d penalty. Typically you can heal these off with other items and/or some sort of imposed challenge goal, like \u201ccollect 200 currency.\u201dWith this gambling system in mind, the pacing is extremely on-point. Typically upgrades are always within reach, and if they aren\u2019t, I can try my luck with the curse mechanic that can also be adapted to with enough time and skill. Even the chance-based systems of Returnal\u00a0can feel fair and balanced. A helpful map that marks items without guesswork is a huge plus.The game\u2019s pacing also highly benefits from a moody atmosphere that is haunting with 3D audio on PS5.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb451457-1743-4b84-ad70-ef1d857da160": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb451457-1743-4b84-ad70-ef1d857da160", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "410df8ad-23d2-46df-994b-0372327c0462", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "00dbce5be9d5c2b481f8fc4c7de22ac1aec453d0e7ddf765d64530649e6d0a7d"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd597bcd-c963-46b6-b7c5-95658793d25c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c048bf92f88cdef4e6ce3b01c54dd981d1357023faeaf2874c547f137ab9883"}}, "hash": "4d55c86080bd0a9985a6b32fc4a2765dd9c1b0f376a966e2370bc41e945c1575", "text": "It\u2019s unsettling pretty much at all times, which is a very cool way to play a tense roguelike. At one point I had to pause Returnal because it got too tense. It sounds hyperbolic, but it was a good run! The real ones understand.It\u2019s all good so far right? Well likewise, the more you play, the more you learn and adapt; the more it can become too familiar. In each individual biome I didn\u2019t find the enemy or environment variety to be as interesting as I\u2019d like, and if you\u2019re stuck on a particular area for a while, it can start to get very samey. It\u2019s\u00a0exacerbated by lengthy periods between permanent upgrades, which can result in a lack of tangible in-game progress: a problem for people who don\u2019t feel like picking up mechanics is its own reward.\u00a0Daily challenges and leaderboards might coax more out of a specific audience (but I\u2019m going to ignore them).Then there\u2019s the rest mode requirement. In Returnal, you need to rest mode your PS5 in order to save progress during a hiatus. So if you\u2019re on a really lengthy good run and want to play something else, you\u2019re pressing your luck. Given how many issues I\u2019ve had with rest mode since launch, I\u2019m always uneasy using it, even if all my tests haven\u2019t seen any issues.Returnal\u00a0is a mostly thrilling sci-fi action romp that suffers from a lack of scale at times. In the moment, I\u2019m completely fixated on my run, upgrading like a fiend, and dashing around for iFrames like I was playing a Capcom game. But after that run ends and I\u2019m looking at the bigger picture, Returnal\u00a0can feel a little smaller than it actually is. Keep that in mind before you take the pricey plunge.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience.

One that you simply must give 100% effort at all moments lest you be struck down swiftly. Housemarque delivers the latest uber-challenging game with Returnal, a roguelike that excels at just about everything it tries to do, while also packing in fascinating mystery.I can best describe Returnal as Alien meets Groundhog day. After crash-landing and finding herself stranded on Atropos, a strange planet, ASTRA Scout Selene faces grave threats in addition to an unraveling mystery. Doomed to relive the experience every time she dies, players will have to beat the odds in order to figure out what's going on and get Selene back home.I really love how the developers weave the game\u2019s narrative into the roguelike gameplay.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd597bcd-c963-46b6-b7c5-95658793d25c": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd597bcd-c963-46b6-b7c5-95658793d25c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb451457-1743-4b84-ad70-ef1d857da160", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d55c86080bd0a9985a6b32fc4a2765dd9c1b0f376a966e2370bc41e945c1575"}, "3": {"node_id": "64fec935-8516-41df-bc5d-ee835044767b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2fe51183161be0c5ec38b291b4ba0a497f9b90312addf8196aab99d5d52061e"}}, "hash": "3c048bf92f88cdef4e6ce3b01c54dd981d1357023faeaf2874c547f137ab9883", "text": "With the nature of the genre, players will die and start from the beginning a lot. The story finds Selene stuck in a twisted time loop, where she constantly relives her ship crashing, and is forced once again to battle powerful creatures. It creates a really interesting mystery, while actually adding some value to dying. Although it still sucks to have to start from scratch, it\u2019s more than just getting your progress wiped and hitting \u201cplay again.\u201d Things are constantly changing, and there are even ways to help yourself on future runs.Though the game is certainly action first, Returnal has the atmospheric tension of a horror game. Not only are the environments twisted and off-putting, but some of the discoveries made along the way were enough to creep me out a few times. There\u2019s sequences where players walk through the halls of an old home, and it feels like a scene pulled directly from P.T.To put it quite frankly - Returnal is one of the most challenging video games I\u2019ve played in years. It\u2019s beyond cliche to compare a game to the likes of Dark Souls simply based on difficulty, but I really do believe that Returnal will sit beside it as some of the most difficult titles in the modern era. It\u2019s a full-on bullet hell, with players constantly having to juggle multiple enemies at once, all while making sure not to fall victim to the hazardous environments.It\u2019s a game that really forces you to learn and adapt to everything it throws at you. There\u2019s a wide variety of hostile enemies and creatures you\u2019ll come across, each of which has their own unique behavioral pattern. There are foes that fire a spread of attacks, some that leap forward and pounce at you, ones that shoot homing attacks, and several others. As I grew to recognize and anticipate upcoming attacks, the combat really began to shine.Returnal really clicks when you get a good feel for movement and traversal. Using my jump and dash maneuvers to dodge attacks, sprinting around the area leaping from platform to platform was nothing short of thrilling.There\u2019s a variety of weapons that players can find and take into battle in Returnal. You have handguns, rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and more. In addition, each weapon features an alt-fire mode, which can be used to deal big damage. Some of the alt-fire modes include an explosive blast shell, an electrifying shock stream, and a tracking swarm. It\u2019s all completely randomized, so any weapon could potentially have any alt-fire mode.The combat in Returnal is just about perfect. The weapons feel great, while also being distinctly unique from one another. The ability to time your reload and overload a weapon adds another mechanic for players to master, and you can even use a sword in close range to deal heavy damage and knock down shields. The combat mechanics combined with the frenetic movement make for a superb roguelike experience.There are a series of bosses in Returnal that players will need to take down in order to make meaningful progress. Like any other enemy, bosses have a specific arsenal of attacks and a behavioral pattern that players can study and adapt to. I must\u2019ve gotten killed by Phrike - the game\u2019s first major boss - half a dozen times before I was able to take him out. Successfully killing bosses in Returnal is another level of rewarding and very satisfying.Like any good Roguelike, there are a ton of different power ups and stat-affecting items to find during your adventure on Atropos. Artifacts are items that are stored in the player\u2019s inventory and provide boosts such as increased damage or Obolites (currency). Consumables grant a temporary gain and are limited to a small handful of slots.One of the really interesting and cool items in Returnal are Parasites. These small creatures physically bind themselves to the player and offer really powerful bonuses. However, they also come with a strong negative side effect. Parasites can be stacked, but the player can not remove them through conventional means. It creates a strategic dynamic where the player has to decide what they\u2019re willing to sacrifice in order to get the edge on enemies.When you die, all of your Artifacts, Consumables, Obolites, and Parasites are lost. It can be incredibly frustrating, but it\u2019s those high stakes that keep the player on edge at literally every moment.With as brutal and unforgiving as Returnal is, I really appreciate how clear and concise the level design and map layout is. The map shows all of the explored areas and indicates what doors players have and haven\u2019t entered.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64fec935-8516-41df-bc5d-ee835044767b": {"__data__": {"id_": "64fec935-8516-41df-bc5d-ee835044767b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8baddfb9-1d04-4447-ad73-c87893ba2620", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "165754d1200d5011d4312c4be48e763953a2a0d2c6e62da72cd44c5380cb0b77"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd597bcd-c963-46b6-b7c5-95658793d25c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c048bf92f88cdef4e6ce3b01c54dd981d1357023faeaf2874c547f137ab9883"}}, "hash": "f2fe51183161be0c5ec38b291b4ba0a497f9b90312addf8196aab99d5d52061e", "text": "What\u2019s more, it also illustrates which of these doors lead to side paths, which ones continue the main path, and which doors will take you to a boss battle. If I want to spend some time gathering loot and resources before taking on the next boss, I can easily plan out my course of action.This is also really helpful when you consider that the world of Atropos is procedurally generated. Every time you die and start over, everything is moved around and rearranged. Though specific rooms may remain the same, they\u2019re in different locations and are incorporated into brand new layouts. Though I liked how it kept the experience fresh, I wasn\u2019t a fan of how the randomness impacted weapons and loot.Weapons, Artifacts, Consumables, and Parasites are also completely randomized in Returnal. Though this is indeed a staple of the roguelike genre, it\u2019s frustrating that some runs feel doomed to fail when all the game serves up to you are sidearms, or if there are no bonuses worth your while. For a game as unforgiving as Returnal is, it sucks when you feel like it wasn\u2019t entirely your fault that you failed.Returnal is strictly exclusive to the PS5 as it\u2019s one of the handful of \u201cnext-gen\u201d games that aren't playable on its predecessor. Aside from being an excellent roguelike, Returnal is a technical marvel. The locations are all so gorgeous and incredibly detailed. Even in moments where my screen was flooded with action and chaos, the PS5 held strong and I experienced practically no major stutters or hiccups.Returnal is also the true showcase of just how spectacular the DualSense controller is. Players pull down the L1 trigger halfway to aim down sights, and you can feel a bit of draw and kickback when you do so. Pulling the trigger all the way is how you activate alt-fire. I originally thought this would be confusing and lead to screw-ups, but the DualSense tech makes it so easy that I don\u2019t think it happened a single time.The controller also emits a sound cue from its built-in speaker to let players know when their alt-fire is fully charged and ready to be used again. If you stand still, you can even feel the raindrops falling and hitting Selene\u2019s spacesuit, thanks to haptic feedback.Housemarque reminds audiences that it\u2019s got the chops to be one of the premier-tier game developers with Returnal. The game is wholly difficult with a roster of powerful enemies and bosses to overcome, but also gives the player everything they need in order to succeed. The game just gets better and better as you go on, as recognizing patterns and learning to adapt is endlessly rewarding. Despite some issues with RNG, it\u2019s hard to knock this creepy sci-fi adventure. Returnal is a must-play PS5 exclusive for any roguelike fan itching for their latest challenge.This review is based on a digital download code provided by the publisher.
