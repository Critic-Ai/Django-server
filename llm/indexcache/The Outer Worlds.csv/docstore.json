He pauses before a cryostasis control panel and, of all the thousands of scientists and engineers he could've thawed out, for some reason he chooses me: a janitor called Pippin with a twirly moustache and a wonky moral compass.This is the beginning of a quirky romp across a solar system ruled by brutal corporations. The Outer Worlds is a light-hearted RPG that aims to emulate the Firefly fantasy. You fly from planet to planet, gather a crew of misfits, pick your way through a series of moral quandaries, and shoot people with cool laser guns.The game's retrofuturistic aesthetics and dark sense of humour pitches The Outer Worlds against Bethesda's Fallout games, but there are important differences. True, you have ray guns, and companions who will shoot enemies and stand around staring awkwardly into walls, but this game isn't a sprawling sandbox experience. You hop between planets and space stations, exploring fairly large (and very pretty) zones full of corporate employees staving off plagues and wild animal attacks. Each area is loaded with loot and sidequests, but it's a tight and prescriptive RPG. You fetch science fiction gadgets for quest givers and make some entertaining moral decisions.That's not a bad thing, but in a world of 70-hour RPGs it's useful to set expectations. The Outer Worlds is a pulpy choose-your-own-adventure experience. If you don't go in expecting a deep systems-driven sandbox, it's a pleasure to breeze through.There's still plenty to tinker with. When you level up you get ten points to pour into your character's stat sheet. I went all-in on my handgun competency to pay homage to Obsidian's cult spy RPG Alpha Protocol, but you can also put stock in personality traits like perception and intelligence to unlock extra conversation options. I recommend that. Pippin the space janitor is an exceptional liar, which means I can mess with corporate stooges in entertaining ways.You can also mod weapons to add sights, improve their ammo capacity or, most importantly, change their damage type. There's a loose rock paper scissors system to combat. Energy weapons mess up animals, electric weapons mess up robots, and pretty much anything messes up humans. You don't really have to care about that if you don't want to, however. For hand-wavy science reasons you can slow down time and easily line up headshots. You can equip melee weapons too, and if you unlock the right skills there's a light parry system that lets you block precisely to rebound opponents.Combat isn't challenging, and enemies fit into worn categories\u2014face rush melee types, sniper types, dog types. But the Jetsons-style sci fi weapons are fun to use and battles are frequently hilarious. Enemies explode into chunks with enthusiasm, often while screaming overwrought barks. It's entertaining even when it goes wrong. I blew a man's head clean off and he fell over screaming \"aaaaargh my eyes, I can't see!\" I've encountered a bunch of other amusing RPG contrivances. I looted money, light, ammo, drugs, and an entire mining suit from a man's dismembered right leg.The corporate colonies are full of employees keen to do the best job they can\u2014largely because getting fired can mean exile and death.Fights exist to put some light friction between meetings with The Outer World's oppressed but surprisingly merry citizens. The corporate colonies are full of employees keen to do the best job they can\u2014largely because getting fired can mean exile and death. The story winds between pockets of people trying their best to survive. The game's main dilemmas ask you to side with one faction against another. You're free to play the freedom fighter or a corporate shill, but quest outcomes are frequently messy and unexpected.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3406072-f17c-41fc-b25a-98d39bf25bc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3406072-f17c-41fc-b25a-98d39bf25bc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "2604c4f1-0a62-4af8-b02e-852205df98b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8044982fbf7636527e48712515461e14e81e9497a0d47927f2139909d3a3d444"}, "3": {"node_id": "d56c3f44-4b96-4180-aaa2-e1e9a1ad79e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8122ab679af692c41528318a9b0d07da3263bdd1dc630d3d28850bc6986edd56"}}, "hash": "ff7bacf354aa563ed5979d09d890a7d77b17dc6b58a0484d7269b6b61f2812f5", "text": "Along with multiple endings, that gives the game some replayability.Your companions have their own stories too. They aren't as meaningful as, say, Mass Effect's companions, but they regularly chip in on conversations. The voice acting is great, but NPCs and companions can seem stilted and unmoving during conversations. There's also some extremely aggressive zoom when you initiate conversation, which takes me all the way back to the looming potato faces of Oblivion.For the most part the game ran beautifully on a GTX970. There were occasional stutters and quick texture popping upon loading into a new area. Barring menu controls, all other keys are rebindable and the game controls well on a mouse and keyboard setup, especially because you can use number keys to quickly select dialogue options.

The advantage of the planet-hopping structure\u2014rather than have a single contiguous wasteland to explore\u2014is variety. It's a colourful universe full of excellent lumpen spaceships that remind me of Red Dwarf. You journey through improbable sci-fi landscapes, brightly lit space stations, and robot-infested facilities. I love the design though some minor texture popping in larger areas took me out of the moment at points.There's a category of games I think of as Saturday morning cartoon games. They lack depth, but they are fluffy and easy to enjoy. As I look back on some screenshots as Pippin laser blasts a poor marauder into a pile of dust, I realise that's what The Outer Worlds is to me. If you meet it on those terms, I think you'll enjoy it.An entertaining, uncomplicated RPG in colourful universe.Part of the UK team, Tom was with PC Gamer at the very beginning of the website's launch\u2014first as a news writer, and then as online editor until his departure in 2020.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nEurogamer, Corp speed.The solar system of Obsidian's The Outer Worlds is swimming with comically evil corporate products: toothpaste that causes blindness, hangover cures that induce comas, each with its jaunty advertising catchphrase and baleful barbershop jingle. Compared to that trove of terrors, the corporate product that is The Outer Worlds itself is kind of like a posh cup-a-soup. It's far from haute cuisine, or especially nutritious - the packaging probably accounts for a solid 30 per cent of the calories - but it goes down easily enough and it won't do you any damage. It's fine, is Outer Worlds. There's nothing I really loathe about it, the tedium of looting aside, and nothing I really love about it either. If you read the sales pitch \"Maker of Fallout: New Vegas makes Fallout-tinted cover version of Mass Effect\" and broke your thumb on the pre-order button, rest assured that this is broadly that. But what else could it have been? The game begins eccentrically enough. The Outer Worlds unfolds in an alternate universe where the USA never passed some critical anti-trust legislation, and humanity is accordingly owned and operated by vast corporations. Your custom-created character is a pioneer aboard the interstellar colony ship Hope, cast out toward the Halcyon system by the all-knowing hand of Profit Motive. Said hand then declines to revive you when the Hope turfs up, decades late, due to a drive malfunction. The system, you learn, has already been settled in your absence and transformed into a fungal, retro-futuristic Wild West, its planets dotted with flat-packed, hardscrabble townships of chrome and timber.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d56c3f44-4b96-4180-aaa2-e1e9a1ad79e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d56c3f44-4b96-4180-aaa2-e1e9a1ad79e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3406072-f17c-41fc-b25a-98d39bf25bc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff7bacf354aa563ed5979d09d890a7d77b17dc6b58a0484d7269b6b61f2812f5"}, "3": {"node_id": "52fbd8bc-a615-4815-a7ce-0610412b7ccd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0aca21597d6326a1d5275467cf708e8ef0dc5275e33290d6e6a3f7839afa267"}}, "hash": "8122ab679af692c41528318a9b0d07da3263bdd1dc630d3d28850bc6986edd56", "text": "It's a place of on-going resource wars and caricatured ideological tensions, with quasi-communist \"Philosophist\" rebels embedded on one moon and a trio of big companies tussling for preeminence. The last thing your employers need is another few hundred mouths to feed, particularly if those colonists then fall in with the lefties. Fortunately, you are sprung from cryosleep by motor-mouthed mad scientist (is there any other kind?) Dr Phineas Wells, who sends you on a quest to unfreeze the remainder of your crew. Among your first feats is to land an escape pod squarely on top of the mercenary captain Phineas has asked to be your chaperone. This frees you from oversight, while also giving you the keys to the mercenary's ship, the Unreliable, a cousin of Mass Effect's Normandy made entirely from trashcans and spit. This serves as your mobile homestead - complete with sarky AI landlord - as you explore Halcyon, undertaking main and optional quests, picking allegiances, unearthing ulterior motives and recruiting six companions to your cause. The two major planets consist of lavish open worlds with several landing sites. You'll spend the bulk of the game here, but there are also smaller areas such as asteroid hideaways, makeshift space bazaars, scorched mining facilities and prisons. Many landing sites must be unlocked by obtaining a pass, which turns The Outer Worlds into an interstellar game of Find the Keycard. You'll obtain these cards as part of the main story, which should last you 20-30 hours if you take your time.I had reasonably high expectations for The Outer Worlds' satire, after spending an hour with it this summer. These expectations were not met, though the writing has its moments. The premise is satisfyingly unceremonious, next to most other RPGs. It introduces you as spare goods, plucked at random from the left luggage locker, and endows you not with the usual Chosen One CV but a selection of blue-collar backstories such as bartender and factory loader. This puts you on the same footing as many of the colonists you'll meet, half of them contractually obliged to speak in advertising slogans; one conversation tree sees you pestering a miserable shopkeeper to say something, anything that's not in his script. There are some decent gags and moderately engrossing scenarios in play. Hackable terminals in the many gutted factories, outposts and laboratories you'll visit are full of emails about workplace abuses, blithe missives from HR, and passive-aggressive spats with coworkers. On one planet, there's a reformist rogue executive who speaks in self-care mantras; his nemesis, the daydreaming socialist across the valley, is a frustrated copywriter (I see you too, Obsidian).Sadly, though, the satire is more often cute than cutting. The game tries sporadically to explore the question of a corporate-run dystopia in earnest, typically by asking you to weigh the mutually exclusive claims of two factions, capitalist and anti-capitalist. But much of the time, the portrayal is too reliant on clich\u00e9s sucked dry by Fallout and Bioshock. The bosses are invariably slick, silver-tongued and content to wallow in hypocrisy. The 50s-style ads that cover walls and loading screens are macabre in a predictable, adolescent way (each has its cheeky disclaimer detailing a range of horrible side effects). The people slaving under the corporate yoke are all folksy, can-do sorts who shave the grammatical subject from every sentence because dang it, there's no time for \"I\" when you're wearing your fingers to the bone on behalf of Johnny CEO. Most importantly, none of it makes much of an impact on your tools and tactics as player, beyond that eye-catching beginning. You could swap The Outer Worlds' social commentary elements for the peaks of Skyrim or Mordor and it would be exactly the same game, which is to say, one you've played many times before.There are a dozen or so skills to level up, with more specialised perks - such as a chance of resetting a companion's ability cooldown - to unlock every other level. You can mod your weapons and armour at worktables for tweaks like quieter footstep noise, and chug down a sizeable range of narcotics for a short-lived stat boost (and subsequent withdrawal symptoms). There are lots of variables, but it all boils down to four, millennia-old ways of role-playing: shooting, hacking, sneaking and talking people round to avoid conflict entirely. Generally, you'll make use of all of these approaches simultaneously, much as you might strive to define yourself as, say, a glib gunslinger or a brainiac with a tournament-class right hook.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52fbd8bc-a615-4815-a7ce-0610412b7ccd": {"__data__": {"id_": "52fbd8bc-a615-4815-a7ce-0610412b7ccd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "d56c3f44-4b96-4180-aaa2-e1e9a1ad79e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8122ab679af692c41528318a9b0d07da3263bdd1dc630d3d28850bc6986edd56"}, "3": {"node_id": "d9997164-b309-4757-acd4-c30fd701d76a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a7ffeee6a77296b20318d056a8ec4754247f5590d89bdf5d5a4eac8370036c66"}}, "hash": "e0aca21597d6326a1d5275467cf708e8ef0dc5275e33290d6e6a3f7839afa267", "text": "There's a slight claustrophobia to The Outer Worlds, for all its searing skyboxes and neon-striped roads winding in amongst hills of alien flora. There are too many ways of beating each quest per square metre. You'll discover key props or half-complete undiscovered quests in passing, and the different routes and means of reaching each waypoint are seldom far apart. You rarely have to really think about what you're doing, or exercise much curiosity about either the environments or the people that live within them - everything just sort of falls into place under your feet.Mind you, you'll be doing plenty of poking around. The Outer Worlds isn't quite as obsessed with loot as Fallout under Bethesda, not least because it doesn't support full object physics, but its landscapes brim nonetheless with containers and bricabrac. Even the homeliest shack in the wilderness is strewn with foodstuffs, weapon mods, equipment, ammo, drugs and sellable junk. You know that you need to sponge up some of the loot - much of it frustratingly tucked in amongst objects you don't want - to keep pace with the difficulty curve, but it's unclear what will prove essential down the line. So you end up gathering absolutely everything, till you hit your character's weight limit and dismantle/eat 50 per cent of your haul in frustration. The gunplay, at least, is smart and stylish enough to puncture the mounting boredom, thanks in no small part to a totally-not-VATS-inspired time-slowing ability that highlights the effects of targeting different body parts. The arsenal is a no-frills stew of pistols, rifles, heavy weapons and melee tools, but you'll need to match ammo types such as plasma or lightning to target vulnerabilities, which takes a bit of planning. It's never Bulletstorm, but it's a cut above mindless mayhem.Much of my apathy for The Outer Worlds' conventions is a question of taste, of course, and there are plenty of RPGs that do the same things worse. But all the same, do we really need another one of these? So much of this game feels like a formula on repeat, for all the charisma of its landscapes, which include some towering fields of Morrowindy mushrooms. Take companions, which, given Obsidian's previous achievements in this area, ought to be where the game is at its best. Your ship's AI is a feisty conversation partner, but your buddies in the field - a vicar, a gawky mechanic, a gun-slinging sawbones, an orphan boy, a battle mech and a bounty hunter - are weirdly interchangeable, even when not concealed beneath layers of armour. They have many lines of incidental dialogue, and offer different perspectives on key plot points. Max, the vicar, is on some level an obedient corporate stooge, while Ella, your medic, balances a brash exterior against a privileged upbringing. But they're oddly devoid of striking qualities once you get to know them, and I was never that interested in hearing their thoughts. Optional loyalty questlines aside, each character has their own potted skilltree and a secondary ability, which is rarely more complicated than dealing a big wodge of damage in one go.As the hours roll on, the objectives and encounters chain together without seam. People want stuff collecting and/or fixing and/or other people killing. The details vary - sometimes your employer is a wizened bounty-hunter whose friends are all dead, and sometimes it's a black market kingpin. Sometimes you're fetching ink for a printing press, and sometimes you're retrieving the targeting module from a crash-landed cruiser. Either way, it's the same waypoint, the same dependable buffet of sneaking, hacking, shooting or talking things through, and the same, slavish anti-climax of combing bins and corpses for goodies. You stop paying attention to concluding binary choices because it feels like there's very little, really, at stake, beyond some percentage points on the faction loyalty screen. I don't hate The Outer Worlds. Rather, what I hate about it is that it's sufficiently unhateful that you can spend 30 hours playing it without noticing. It's solidly-made enough that you keep hanging around in the hope of something more, like a layer of catchy percussion that never quite escalates into a song. I guess to sum things up, I would like two features to be added to the game. One is a powerful suction cannon with infinite extra-dimensional storage, so I can just gather all the loot in one fell swoop. The other is the option to hand off dialogue decisions to one of my companions, because I have no strong feelings either way, comrades.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9997164-b309-4757-acd4-c30fd701d76a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9997164-b309-4757-acd4-c30fd701d76a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "52fbd8bc-a615-4815-a7ce-0610412b7ccd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0aca21597d6326a1d5275467cf708e8ef0dc5275e33290d6e6a3f7839afa267"}, "3": {"node_id": "7498f84f-ae68-4adb-a9d4-bac6f1d30431", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "54778c08786f98abd93722a4663707e8aee336d9e514baf7692ca74daf2c82d1"}}, "hash": "a7ffeee6a77296b20318d056a8ec4754247f5590d89bdf5d5a4eac8370036c66", "text": "Let me do clean-up in the background, hosing down the level's crevices with one earbud in, following the conversation absent-mindedly.

The Outer Worlds tells a slightly different story, about how humanity\u2019s settlement of the stars would go if it were driven by a 1950s style corporate culture. It\u2019s a distinct vision of adventure capitalism on new and dangerous planets, with a similarly comedy-bleak outlook.Developed by Obsidian, makers of Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic II and Fallout: New Vegas, the first piece of good news is that The Outer Worlds harks back to Fallout\u2019s golden age, when conversations were at the heart of the game rather than a minor inconvenience to be minimised where possible. Talking is central to everything in The Outer Worlds, a game that\u2019s been structured so that you can complete all its campaign missions without even firing a shot, if your character is charming and persuasive enough.You play a deep-frozen colonist, whose 10-year journey from Earth ends with the entire ship drifting in space because the Halcyon system\u2019s economy is in such bad shape it isn\u2019t profitable enough to thaw everyone out. You\u2019re plucked at random from the freezer by wanted fugitive Phineas Welles, who would like your help to fight back against the cold-blooded corporations that are in charge.You quickly inherit a starship, and once you\u2019ve fixed it up and recruited your first crew member it\u2019s time to explore the solar system, righting wrongs and inadvertently creating a great many of your own. Partly inspired by Firefly\u2019s brand of Frontierland-in-space, this has a similarly Wild West aesthetic, the one-horse towns and colourful characters embodying the pioneer spirit, whilst bucking against their corporate overlords and the appalling bureaucracy they inflict.The Outer Worlds\u2019 biggest departure from the established Fallout model is that rather than exploring solo you can select up to two companions from your slowly expanding crew to accompany you on missions. As well as adding firepower they also bring their own skills, and boost yours, adding to your ability to hack computers, fix machines, lie, charm, and intimidate. But they turn out to be a lot more interesting than just walking stat buffs.Each companion comes with his or her own backstory, character arc, and personality. As well as backing you up in a fight they also chip in on conversations and chat amongst themselves as you\u2019re exploring. The sheer quantity and quality of dialogue for each is astounding, given the huge number of missions and conversations you undertake and the range of crew members you have available to you.It\u2019s supremely well written, with eccentric characters proving to be funny, articulate, and well-acted. If you\u2019ve recently been playing Ghost Recon Breakpoint, this won\u2019t so much be refreshing as a reaffirmation that conversations in video games can be compelling rather than soul-crushing. And they don\u2019t have to be locked away in soporific cut scenes either. The Outer Worlds\u2019 character interactions are central to most missions.You\u2019ll regularly have five choices of what to say, some of which come from your intelligence, perception, or, say, medical skills, and others that are available to all. Some responses will be kind, some rude, and some magnificently absurd. The result is that each encounter is captivating, as well as furthering both plot and mission objectives. It\u2019s inspiring, and the writers\u2019 ability to keep throwing fresh and often hilarious new personalities at you remains a delight throughout.Something that hasn\u2019t changed one bit since the days of Fallout is the plethora of loot. Carrying capacity will never be too far from the front of your mind as you plunder everything that\u2019s not nailed down to use, sell, or breakdown for parts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78c82deb-5766-444c-b62f-709fe66bb58c": {"__data__": {"id_": "78c82deb-5766-444c-b62f-709fe66bb58c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "7498f84f-ae68-4adb-a9d4-bac6f1d30431", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "54778c08786f98abd93722a4663707e8aee336d9e514baf7692ca74daf2c82d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "05788aa9-73ef-4866-8955-b451539e1ca7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "92b72f1d9aa2973383ed074667b3b88d24d9156a58f34d4f8c12723dfee3fbbf"}}, "hash": "58ad0e57fbae956578ce01d6115ff41617ee84770446995596043d9054490615", "text": "Whether it\u2019s the corpse of a freshly downed marauder or a previously locked room in a company office, there\u2019s loot all over the place and it\u2019s always in your interests to acquire as much of it as you can lift.As you win fights and complete objectives you earn experience points to level up your character. Each level gives you 10 upgrade points to spend on stats that max out at 100 but allow you to specialise more deeply once they pass 50. Every two levels you also get a new perk point, which can be applied to gain a permanent bonus. Your companions have perks too, which you choose to complement your own.Not content with the usual character development path, Obsidian has also incorporated the flaws system. Keep getting burnt, and you\u2019ll be offered a free perk point in return for a small flame-related debuff. Fall off a lot of high places, and you\u2019ll be offered a fear of heights, again in return for a perk. It\u2019s an interesting system that does indeed result in a more defined character, with weaknesses as well as strengths, that specifically relate to what\u2019s happened on your adventure so far.You\u2019ll need all the buffs you can get, because fights do get messy. First person melee combat is always a bit chaotic, but once you add the weapons output of two companions and however many enemies you\u2019re blasting there can be a great deal of hot lead and plasma flying around thanks to guns that have a chunky, primitive charm. It\u2019s all manageable though, and triggering your companions\u2019 recharging special moves at the right time is a skill of its own.Along with human foes, each planet comes with its own ferocious wildlife, from giant larva-like mantipillars to lizardy raptidons, and automechanicals \u2013 The Outer Worlds\u2019 take on robots. They all have weaknesses to certain types of attack, whether electric, fire-based, or ballistic, while the numbers that pop up showing how much damage you\u2019re dealing drop towards the bottom of the screen if the weapon you\u2019re using is ill-suited to that enemy. It\u2019s a neat visual cue that doesn\u2019t get in the way of the action.One of the other things The Outer Worlds gets almost perfectly right is the balance amongst the game\u2019s different skills and their usefulness in any given situation. You genuinely can talk your way through most missions. At the same time, engineering, weapons, and melee skills will also see you right, even if having those alone will mean you can\u2019t open certain locked chests and rooms. There are even unique weapons that rely on the science skill to increase damage, bolstering the arsenals of those who choose a more cerebral approach and allowing you to take on the occasional side quest that really does just need firepower.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader\u2019s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepAlthough every bit as deep and complex as Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout, it has a far greater level of polish, with no bugs or crashes evident during a lengthy playthrough.

Given the astonishing intricacy of the systems involved and the diversity of different characters and their potential interactions with the plot, it\u2019s a remarkable achievement.

And there\u2019s artistry at work, not only in the colourful yet deadly fauna, and beauty of its worlds and rusting space stations, but also in the way the plot is woven in with your character and those you recruit to your crew.

Or, rather, you're going to have a lot of people talk at you before selecting from one of several pre-written dialogue options in response. Anyone who's played a Fallout game won't be a stranger to this kind of interaction, but The Outer Worlds is keen to put these discursive parlays at the forefront of its role-playing experience.\u00a0In fact, I'd wager that over two thirds of my time with The Outer Worlds was spent in conversation with Halcyon's denizens, all fully formed with their own thoughts and motivations, and brought to life through strong voice performances and convincingly rendered facial animations across the board.\u00a0That amount of verbiage will sound off-putting at first, but these are some of the most well written, multi-faceted, intelligent and human NPCs I've ever had the joy of getting to know, and the intricacies of conversing with them brings its own kind of rewards, making for The Outer Worlds' best moments.\u00a0These characters will react so acutely to your behaviour, the company you keep, and the events that transpire around them, it hurts my brain to even imagine how Obsidian accounted for every dialogue tree stored within their coded personas.\u00a0Whether it's a potential boss fight suddenly becoming a lucrative trade partner after it turns out he's friends with one of my companions, or a total stranger expressing their disgust at my choice of clothing, I never got tired of discovering how Halcyon's inhabitants would express themselves in conversation, even if I did sometimes find myself skipping through chunks of dialogue when the exchange got too exposition heavy. \u00a0\"I said to the team, 'I hope this becomes your Fallout'\": The directors of The Outer Worlds discuss its developmentThe Outer Worlds frontloads its deep dialogue systems because Obsidian knows that's where its strengths lie; but it's still a shame that the game's combat still feels relatively undemanding and rudimentary in comparison. There's nothing particularly wrong with it, per se, but the game's array of first-person firefights and melee brawls don't quite enthral in the same way as its contemporaries, even with a fairly substantial arsenal of weapons at your disposal.\u00a0Take Tactical Time Dilation; a side-effect of your character's sudden awakening from cryosleep which lets you slow down time at will. It's The Outer World's replacement for Fallout's VATS mode, yet lacks that system's strategic orientation and memorable sense of impact, thus ending up as a forgettable gimmick that adds little depth or colour to combat. Sneak enthusiasts will also likely be disappointed by the The Outer Worlds' ropey stealth mechanics, which make it frustratingly difficult to execute covert kills without alerting other nearby enemies, especially in the absence of ranged tools like crossbows or silencers.\u00a0There is, at least, a full cast of recruitable companions, two of whom can join you on your adventures at any one time, and bring their own flavours to the carnage via special attacks that lend a pulpy, cinematic flair to critical hits.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eddaa90b-7f62-4ae1-891e-1b55c654a6c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "eddaa90b-7f62-4ae1-891e-1b55c654a6c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "05788aa9-73ef-4866-8955-b451539e1ca7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "92b72f1d9aa2973383ed074667b3b88d24d9156a58f34d4f8c12723dfee3fbbf"}, "3": {"node_id": "b878eced-db79-4014-be6b-f5d8c91014bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1db9034aa18a366345a9e8f18cdefa775a3f6537b42a6098d6e1360691d40d2f"}}, "hash": "d289853f2dc0cb7d827c4bb19a0320a1fd7b004be9c12062e02b533f3add604c", "text": "Watching them stomp, smash, quip, and drop kick their way through enemies was enough to keep fights entertaining, even if the efforts of my own attacks never connected with as much panache or impact.Here's the thing, though; you can avoid The Outer Worlds' combat encounters almost entirely if it's not your cup of tea, because the choices about the kind of spacefarer you want to be affects the player experience from top to bottom, as emphasised from the moment you boot up the game and start creating your character.\u00a0Invest your Skill Points in Engineering and Stealth, for example, and you should be able to hack and lockpick your way around any nearby aggressors, while those with the gift of the gab (a.k.a. a high Dialogue and Temperament build) can usually pursue verbal alternatives to violence, avoiding the need for any conflict in the first place. The freedom to progress your character through The Outer Worlds' dizzying brew of attributes, skill points, perks, flaws, companions, armour and weapon management, and reputation borders on limitless, and practically demands multiple playthroughs of its 25-30 hour campaign.\u00a0That campaign is just as enrapturing and open-ended as The Outer Worlds' old school RPG foundations, too, beginning as a simple quest to save your abandoned colony ship from being left in orbit by Halcyon's ruling mega-corporation The Board, and unfolding into something else entirely over the course of your planet-hopping escapades. That's thanks to Obsidian's masterfully constructed branching narrative, one that's completely free from any binary morality system to weigh it down.\"The Outer Worlds absolutely delivers on its premise as an immersive, full-bodied RPG.\"You can kill friends, partner up with former enemies, or terrorise entire towns if you want to, but Obsidian's carefully layered system of failsafes and alternate pathways means there'll always a plausible route for you to pursue each questline, with no arbitrary gauge of right and wrong to push you in certain directions. In a way, this makes some of The Outer World's narrative choices even more tough to grapple with, as they all sit in deliciously uncomfortable grey areas with no gamified moral code to rely on for answers.\u00a0I can't count how many times I was about to close the books on one of The Outer World's many multi-layered quest lines with a decision, before one last minute factor (perhaps one of my companions suddenly voicing their opinion on the matter, or an uncovered computer log revealing a new side to the story), made me reconsider my choices all over again. The Outer Worlds' multiple endings are an inevitable offshoot of that fluid structure, then, but - no matter how you see in the credits - you'll know you've left a determinable impact upon this world, one that will have changed the course of its future.\u00a0And what a world it is. Halcyon has been meticulously conjured up by Obsidian from top to bottom, with some of the finest writing and world-building I've seen from a game in recent memory. The studio sets its sights firmly on the avaricious extremes and laughable absurdities of crony capitalism, consumer culture, and red-tape bureaucracy, littered with satirical parables of exploitation that are as tragic as they are rib-tickling in their jet black punchlines.\u00a0Everyone in Halcyon has a story to tell about corporate mismanagement, mistreatment, or straight out malevolence, each one darkly humorous in tone yet not too far-fetched from the stories of greed and callousness you see in the real world today, making them all the more powerful as indictments of the ruling class. But there's real soul at the heart of this dystopian milieu, too, especially when it comes to your crew of motley companions.\u00a0Each recruitable team mate (who will also readily leave your services if you do something to piss them off) steps aboard your ship with their own personal worldviews, emotional baggage, and connections to Halcyon, but watching this group of strangers slowly gel into a united crew of friends is genuinely affecting.\u00a0From the adorably naive Parvati, to the curt yet always surprising Vicar Max, the way in which each companion develops believable relationships with you and each other evokes the kind of space crew camaraderie that harkens back to the best of Mass Effect 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b878eced-db79-4014-be6b-f5d8c91014bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "b878eced-db79-4014-be6b-f5d8c91014bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "eddaa90b-7f62-4ae1-891e-1b55c654a6c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d289853f2dc0cb7d827c4bb19a0320a1fd7b004be9c12062e02b533f3add604c"}, "3": {"node_id": "422a1a7f-d486-43fe-8a9b-be4ef795e54a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9625837a76f54d99f20b90c605ac6c1c4f0ffa09ecba15756f48af9153933ec1"}}, "hash": "1db9034aa18a366345a9e8f18cdefa775a3f6537b42a6098d6e1360691d40d2f", "text": "By the end of my travels, I was completely invested in the world of Halcyon as a living, breathing place, and can only hope this is just the beginning of a brand new franchise for Obsidian, especially now that it's a first-party studio with the might and support of Microsoft behind it.Each of Halcyon's various zones are relatively small in size, but Obsidian makes up for that more focused scale with a strong sense of environmental diversity, from drifting megamalls soaked in neon to terraformed jungles of engorged fungi and craggy red rock. Not only that, but one of The Outer Worlds' greatest distinctions from its most obvious comparison, Fallout, is its exceptional level of polish, at least on PlayStation 4.\u00a0Playing on a standard PS4 Slim, the game ran at a reliable and steady framerate, with only the odd freeze and texture pop-in occurring here and there to load in assets for new environments, while I can count the total number of bugs I encountered in my first playthrough on one hand. Loading times are a bit of a hassle in terms of their length and frequency, but The Outer Worlds is an experience that's otherwise hard to fault on the technical side, with a glowing, Golden Age inspired art style that elevates its modest graphical makeup into some seriously eye-pleasing playgrounds.Obsidian's talent for sharp writing, choice-based narrative, and complex role-playing systems have coalesced together to create one of the strongest new IPs of the generation with The Outer Worlds. There's plenty of room for improvement when it comes to making combat as compelling and rewarding as the rest of the game but, nevertheless, The Outer Worlds absolutely delivers on its premise as an immersive, full-bodied RPG that successfully picks up the baton where Bethesda has been dropping it of late.\u00a0Those expecting a straight-up spiritual successor to Fallout: New Vegas might be surprised by Obsidian's more contained and old-fashioned approach to science fiction, but stick with this unashamedly talkative tragic comedy, and you'll discover one of the smartest games of the year.\u00a0I'm GamesRadar's Features Writer, which makes me responsible for gracing the internet with as many of my words as possible, including reviews, previews, interviews, and more.

Your compatriots include a religious zealot, a heavy drinker, a compulsive cleaning robot, and other imperfect individuals. However, despite their flaws, this plucky team can help you find remarkable and unconventional solutions to the colony\u2019s biggest problems. Whether you want to heal a rift between warring factions or destabilize a governing body, the underdogs of the Unreliable can get it done.Like the misfits it features, The Outer Worlds finds inspiring success despite its rough edges. It has technical and visual quirks, and can veer dangerously close to feeling archaic, but these aren\u2019t the qualities that define the game. Instead, The Outer Worlds distinguishes itself with a crumbling space colony controlled by cartoonishly evil corporate interests, then sets you and your party loose to explore, aid, and incite. Maybe that involves gunplay and innocent casualties \u2013 or maybe you can talk your way out of conflict altogether. The Outer Worlds finds brilliant and fun ways to blend signature aspects of well-known series like Fallout and Mass Effect; it is a space adventure featuring a likable cast and\u00a0an irreverent-yet-dangerous frontier, with entertaining gameplay bridging the gaps.\u00a0The single best part is the freedom you have in approaching the various problems plaguing Halcyon.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "422a1a7f-d486-43fe-8a9b-be4ef795e54a": {"__data__": {"id_": "422a1a7f-d486-43fe-8a9b-be4ef795e54a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "b878eced-db79-4014-be6b-f5d8c91014bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1db9034aa18a366345a9e8f18cdefa775a3f6537b42a6098d6e1360691d40d2f"}, "3": {"node_id": "81791ecb-964d-4ca5-8868-19bd686bfbf8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc7f157ad1fcd15d9771c63d42046b1b014344fc91e2c298ba004d0b77199c49"}}, "hash": "9625837a76f54d99f20b90c605ac6c1c4f0ffa09ecba15756f48af9153933ec1", "text": "The corporations have done a terrible job taking care of their workers/citizens, so you need to reroute power, recover salvage, and reconcile militant factions across various planets and space stations. As you try to address these issues, The Outer Worlds deftly presents options beyond simple \u201cstealth or melee\u201d scenarios; depending on how you build your character and which tasks you complete, you can pursue a wealth of available options with rewarding outcomes.In one case, I needed to access a high-security area in a government building. I found a woman who could sneak me in if I convinced her I was interested in a romantic rendezvous, or I could investigate a lunch-related feud between her and a coworker to win her over. Another option was simply stealing a disguise, which also required a silver tongue to divert suspicion if detected. Of course, I could have also opened fire and fought my way through, but I was so adept at lying and persuading that I usually only considered naked hostility as a last resort. This kind of flexibility makes The Outer Worlds especially satisfying, because no matter how you specialize, the team at Obsidian provides\u00a0something clever to do apart from deciding how to kill folks.Though I often sought nonaggressive solutions, I had fun with combat when it happened. Again, the flavor of encounters changes based on how you\u2019ve allocated your skill points. My first character was melee-focused, with lots of points invested in buffing my companions;\u00a0eventually, they could handle most fights without me. For my second playthrough, I made a more active hero, specialized in handguns and rifles\u00a0with perks spent on improving a tactical time-slowing power (similar to Fallout\u2019s V.A.T.S. system). Regardless of your focus, the controls are responsive and feel great. I especially liked firing off my companions\u2019 cinematic attacks.The crew of the Unreliable are solid traveling buddies, assuming you choose to recruit them. In different ways, they all struggle to find a place to belong in Halcyon, and I enjoyed getting to know them gradually through a mixture of conversations, ambient banter, and personal quests. However, these interactions are too sparse. What\u2019s there is excellent; their dialogue and stories are well-done, and I like how most of them don\u2019t fit neatly into established archetypes. But they can also feel oddly peripheral considering the time you spend with them by your side.Structurally, the game follows the blueprint established by classics like Knights of the Old Republic. You go to a planet or settlement, do some quests, and eventually make a bigger decision that determines the fate of the area. Over the course of my two playthroughs \u2013 one thorough, one fast \u2013 I saw these scenarios play out in different ways, and I was a bit disappointed at how black-and-white\u00a0the options are. Most boil down to siding with a heartless corporation or a group of freedom-loving dissidents, though completing sidequests usually reveals an optimal third option, like bringing feuding groups together. This predictability diminishes the magnitude of the seemingly significant choices, and combined with the static explanation screens you get during the ending, this is an area where The Outer Worlds feels outdated.Even if the larger beats don\u2019t always land, The Outer Worlds shines with a constant stream of small, bright moments. An amusing interaction with a clueless guard. A sugary corporate jingle. A brutal sneak attack. A solution to a problem you are sure won\u2019t work, but it does. The team at Obsidian excels at encouraging creative experimentation within its responsive and absurd setting, ensuring that every visit to Halcyon is full of delightful surprises.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

It is, surprisingly, the best possible version of a Fallout game--a potent distillation of what made that series so beloved in the first place.The Outer Worlds adopts the most compelling innovations of modern Fallout games, emphasising immersive exploration and impactful, action-oriented combat in a game engine (Unreal Engine) that actually makes those things feel good by contemporary standards. It shares Fallout's satirical but incredibly bleak look at the future, but is free of its tired tropes. Critically, The Outer Worlds exhibits the same depth of soul as the early Interplay and Black Isle Fallout games (as well as other games in the '90s PC RPG genre) with a genuinely complex, interconnected narrative web of relationships and events that feel like they can change in a seemingly infinite number of ways based on the character you want to be, the variety of choices you can make, and the actions you take.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: The Outer Worlds Video ReviewGiven the studio and the key people responsible (original Fallout creators Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky), that last trait isn't surprising. But it's not the only element that makes The Outer Worlds an excellent space Western adventure--that's just the incredibly sound foundation that elevates the game's great world-building, wonderful characters, and multi-layered quest design, on top of punchy combat and consistently sharp writing.In The Outer Worlds, you are just one of the thousands of people left in hibernation on an abandoned colony ship, when a scientist of possibly ill repute frees you and enlists your help in saving the rest of your frozen peers. After a rigorous character creation process--involving a slew of variable attributes, perks, and aesthetic customization--you crash-land on a planet, alone, and from there, how you make your mark on the Halcyon system is up to you.The crux of this sci-fi setup is that, among other things, the Halcyon system is owned and run entirely by a board of corporations, and their presence is a big deal. Whole planets are owned by corps looking to use their ecosystems as part of a larger supply chain, and numerous vending machines from different companies populate towns, trying to attract you with their bright logos and jingles. In fact, The Outer Worlds is saturated with strikingly colourful locales; the planets you'll visit are impressively varied and sometimes beautiful, flaunting an H.G. Wells-like retro-futuristic aesthetic, the antithesis of grimdark cyberpunk.On the first impression, corporations appear as a mostly aesthetic layer folded into the world. A number of the companies mentioned seem to mostly just exist as manufacturers of weapons and consumables--a piece of flair to keep the tone light in the same way that the Circus of Values exists in BioShock, but it's far more ingrained than that. Corporate capitalism so deeply affects everything in The Outer Worlds, and explorations into how it can affect society on a variety of levels is a surprisingly well-considered constant, despite the semblance of parody. You'll meet sympathetic workers whose livelihoods are only made possible by offering themselves to exploitation and indentured servitude, white-collared outlaws who are more bureaucrats than pirates, and well-meaning middle-managers who are trying to change the corporate machine from the inside. You'll find moderates, idealists, extremists, and most things in between and around the fringes, all of which have their own feasible ideas about how to best serve the colony or themselves. By the time the climax hits, it's clear that The Outer Worlds has its own stance on this bleak future, but that doesn't stop the world it creates, the sojourns you take, and characters you meet along the way from being any less fascinating.There are plenty of characters in The Outer Worlds who I didn't like. Reed Tobson, for example, is a snivelling factory chief in the early hours of the game who I didn't have to think twice about undermining, and Felix, one of your potential companion characters, had such an annoyingly naive personality I avoided talking to him as much as possible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fdd67d1-7d47-42d4-a755-a51dffbb2b3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fdd67d1-7d47-42d4-a755-a51dffbb2b3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "81791ecb-964d-4ca5-8868-19bd686bfbf8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc7f157ad1fcd15d9771c63d42046b1b014344fc91e2c298ba004d0b77199c49"}, "3": {"node_id": "779d1715-d829-496a-b007-fb2e5224deef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "274b35b2b9cc1699dd122c550eb5cf0aa4295462fc934572265f1bd5a92ceb5a"}}, "hash": "3d1608f98c30bc018d60c1a30875c0220b60494379eaafd31315d289fd3f8dc0", "text": "The Outer Worlds allows you to kill any character in the game (bar one), and the world will reshape and move on without them, but there's something to be said for game's depiction of its unappealing people, whose portrayal I admired despite my distaste. You'll talk to a lot of people in The Outer Worlds. How much you do is up to you--you're allowed to cut straight to get to the point or dive deeper--but chatting to the game's entire supporting cast of non-player characters is something that never gets tiring, even if you don't care for them, purely because of how strong the game's writing and vocal performances are.I never felt like I had to endure stretches of pointless or overly dramatic exchanges, both because of how focussed and subtle the script seemed to be, as well as the variety of response options for my player character which kept conversations flowing in largely natural ways. Numerous considerations for the world state let conversations take into account things you may or may not already have done throughout your campaign; brief and subtle injections of worldbuilding and lore stop conversation from being too matter of fact without losing the game's identity, and some exceptional low-key wit works very well in sparking a periodic laugh without humour feeling like a sticking point. Solid, consistent voice direction helps keep the tone firmly measured, meaning the hours you spend absorbing the world through its people are always engaging.Nowhere does the strength of the game's characters shine more strongly than in your companions, however (except for Felix; that guy is a weenie). You have the option to recruit six predetermined characters to accompany and assist you in your adventures, though the game does have tools to bolster a lone wolf character too. But having companions along for the ride is a delight, and that's, again, because of the strength of the character writing. Companions instantly feel like fleshed-out characters of their own accord, not like they simply exist to revolve around you. They'll converse privately with each other and chime in on conversations you have with other characters in the world, acting as sounding boards during key moments. They can, in extreme situations, leave you of their own accord if they strongly disagree with a course of action. It's all mechanically conditional, of course, but the illusion the game builds is so endearing--spending time with these folks feels just as valuable as your pursuing the overarching goal.Companions have their own customisable skill trees, equipment loadouts, combat tactics, and special abilities you can command them to use, which, with their cinematic camera angles, inspired battle cries, and useful status effects, never become unsatisfying to initiate. The other major tool at your disposal in combat, provided your character's weapon skills are high enough to use it, is Tactical Time Dilation (TTD)--a time-bending mechanic that slows the action to a crawl, allowing you to give yourself some breathing room in order to analyse enemies and take the time to execute precision attacks. Hitting certain locations on enemies will let you do things like cripple or maim them, or inflict weapon-specific effects like bleed damage or knocking them unconscious. Using TTD tactically to take out key targets and attempt to control the flow of battle makes it an entertaining and useful tool, but its availability is limited and not something you can rely on entirely until you get to meaningfully upgrade it much later in the game.Despite having strong RPG foundations, the combat in The Outer Worlds is very much focussed on first-person action, incorporating things like parries, blocks, and dodges on top of an array of melee weapons and firearms. There's a hectic and fast-paced fluidity to combat that feels very good, however. That's aided by some enthusiastic sound design, which does most of the heavy lifting in giving all weapons some satisfying feedback. A range of \"Science weapons\" bring some creative diversity in your arsenal, and features guns that have unique, entertaining properties like shrinking enemies or turning them against each other.The only problem with combat is that on the game's recommended Regular difficulty, it eventually turns into a cakewalk. This is satisfying in a way, of course--all the points I pumped into maxing out my handgun skills, thus becoming best gunslinger in the galaxy, did actually make me feel utterly invincible. But, it also meant I didn't feel pushed to explore the game's slew of combat-adjacent mechanics nearly as deeply as I would have hoped. Things like elemental damage, equipment modding, companion synergies, and the special effects allowed by consumables (which, by the way, are incredibly difficult to parse in the game's icon-heavy menu), could all be safely ignored.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "779d1715-d829-496a-b007-fb2e5224deef": {"__data__": {"id_": "779d1715-d829-496a-b007-fb2e5224deef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fdd67d1-7d47-42d4-a755-a51dffbb2b3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d1608f98c30bc018d60c1a30875c0220b60494379eaafd31315d289fd3f8dc0"}, "3": {"node_id": "2338a3b6-5131-44ad-ba2a-3be7812148f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f5d4bf87c59831cbb4c72ec910da3de3938250038518cbcad2cef2a7804792b"}}, "hash": "274b35b2b9cc1699dd122c550eb5cf0aa4295462fc934572265f1bd5a92ceb5a", "text": "The Outer Worlds has a \"flaws\" system that lets you purposefully shoulder restrictive debuffs in certain situations in exchange for an extra perk point, but it's completely optional and rarely worth the tradeoff. Jumping into the \"Supernova\" difficulty level in a subsequent playthrough changes all that, however--combat danger increases, your ability to save your game becomes restricted, and survival mechanics like hunger and thirst are introduced, making all of the game's mechanical considerations feel far more vital. The game is more challenging and interesting because of it, but its demanding nature definitely makes it more of a second-run option.Toe-to-toe combat is not the only solution to your problems. The Outer Worlds allows for a variety of avenues for alternative and passive solutions--stealth, hacking, and speech-related options are available throughout the game, provided you pass the skill checks. It's nigh impossible to complete the game without getting into at least some combat, unfortunately, but to the game's credit, virtually every quest in the game, big or small, features branching options in terms of their paths to success and how you deal with the big, final choices you have to make to resolve disputes, which are often deliciously grey. It's at the level where you'll always be considering the additional ways you could have achieved something, whether that be taking a different route, finding more information out in the world, or killing the quest giver and everyone else in the town. When you hit the end, the game runs through a whole slew of epilogues that describe how you resolved the game's numerous major variables and what became of them, and being shown all your exploits after some 30 hours makes the whole journey and your unique path through it really feel quite meaningful. It's difficult to know the full extent of just how many directions something can go, and the end result of many quests can likely only ever differ in a small handful of ways, but this perception of freedom and possibilities on your first run is inspiring.I finished The Outer Worlds wanting more, eager to jump back into the world to see extra things. It's not a short game, but it's one packed with such a steady stream of wonderful characters to meet, interesting places to explore, and meaningful, multi-layered quests to solve, that it didn't feel like there was any room to get tired of it. I wanted to rewind the clock and do everything in a completely different way. The Outer Worlds is consistently compelling throughout, and it's a superb example of how to promote traditional RPG sensibilities in a sharp, modern experience.

I offered to help, but he hesitated. Was I using Spacer\u2019s Choice health care products? His contract clearly states that he can\u2019t use a competing product. This was my first real introduction to the weird, corporate dystopia of the Halcyon system, where giant, sprawling conglomerates have the final word on just about everything, and everyone is simply trying to get by. But maybe I can help with this whole mess, if I decide to try. The game begins with Phineas Welles \u2014 a guy who\u2019s a little like a nicer Rick, sans Morty \u2014 waking me from cryosleep aboard the colonist vessel the Hope. The Hope was lost in space, I\u2019ve been frozen for 70 years, and the entire system went straight to hell while I was on ice.

I grab a weapon, begin to explore the galaxy in the game\u2019s first-person view, fight enemies when necessary, and spend a lot of time talking to people.The game unfolds in an extremely \u201cold lady who swallowed a fly\u201d fashion. I need a ship to get where I\u2019m going, so I should go over there to hire one. Oh no \u2014 the guy who owned the ship is dead, and the thing is broken anyways. Guess I need a power supply. Well, the person with the power supplies needs help with a little problem ... you get the idea.Before I know it, I have a full quest log and I\u2019m trekking out with some companions to murder raiders, find lost citizens, and check out a power plant. This is a society run by corporations, like the aforementioned Spacer\u2019s Choice, and almost everyone I talk to is an employee or cog of some kind in that ecosystem.It\u2019s hard to kill, or even fight, a corporation; if you destroy a CEO, another will be appointed. All of this leads to a large-scale confrontation: Welles wants to tear down the Board that runs the colonized Halcyon system and unfreeze all my fellow Hope colonists so he can reform society.The Hope held the best and the brightest minds before it became lost, but more importantly, we haven\u2019t been conditioned to love these corporations in the same manner as those who were born and grew up in the Halcyon system. We believe we can find a better way, because we originally lived in a time where business didn\u2019t always have its boot on our necks ... or at least, the boot wasn\u2019t pressing down quite so firmly. It\u2019s one of the more interesting subplots in the game: I\u2019m willing to fight for the future because we know a better future is possible. Most of the other people around me don\u2019t even know what they\u2019ve given up, including most of my own companions.As in many classic RPGs, each big idea or goal in The Outer Worlds rapidly devolves into a series of quests where I need to either collect or kill things, or find a clever way to avoid doing either.And everything comes down to choices. Am I for the \u201cgreater good,\u201d or sticking it to corporations at all costs? Am I a mercenary, a freedom fighter, a burnout, or a sociopath? Happily, the game seems to be ready for whatever I decide I\u2019d like to do. I\u2019m able to betray Phineas right away if I so choose, for instance, by turning him in to the authorities. There are very few rails on this ride.Those very important choices begin when I\u2019m creating my character. I take great care to sculpt a face (that I ultimately don\u2019t see very much), decide my origin (I chose to be a former Earth cashier, so I have some charisma up my sleeve), and then spend some skill points.The Outer Worlds lets me allocate points to a variety of skills in combat, social situations, technology, and even leadership in battle. I\u2019ve put a lot of points into the Sneak skill category in my latest build, for instance. Once the category has been leveled up enough, I can choose to prioritize subskills of Sneak, like Hacking or Lockpicking. I can also select perks that make my life a little easier, like adding extra health or the ability to carry more, or heavier, items. This isn\u2019t about min-maxing as much as it\u2019s about the options I would like to have when solving problems.In one settlement, I\u2019m able to use my medical checks to figure out an important piece of backstory. The plague that I\u2019m trying to fight isn\u2019t anything beyond mortal comprehension; it\u2019s just the flu! Then, I can use my knowledge of how the flu works to lean on the town\u2019s boss for more info about why people aren\u2019t healing from the plague. Turns out, he\u2019s sending them to work even harder to cleanse their imperfections through capitalism!

This is all extremely great for role-playing. Every time I see a robot, my blood runs cold. Their plasma damage hurts, even though I\u2019m now much stronger and tougher because of our bouts. The Outer Worlds nails the feeling of playing a game being run by a talented, but rather mischievous, dungeon master. The combat itself is perfectly adequate, if you decide you\u2019d rather just fight your way toward your goals. There\u2019s even a VATS-like system called Tactical Time Dilation that\u2019s a side effect of my cryosleep. I can slow time at any moment to aim shots, dodge enemies, and reposition myself to have a stronger advantage in combat. The Outer Worlds was never going to be an action game, but the shooting and fighting is above average for a game that\u2019s trying to offer a little bit of everything.As I go about the game and things go wrong, I might get the opportunity to accept a flaw as part of my build. For instance, my character isn\u2019t having a great time fighting robots. The game gives me the option to take on the flaw of Robophobia, and offers me a perk point as compensation. I lean into this, turning the perk into extra carrying weight. I\u2019m stronger overall, but robots remain my bane, and I have a grudge against them.It\u2019s not like relying on brutality means you won\u2019t get to role-play! During another run, I meet an important character during a mission and shoot him in the face, which takes much less time than talking to him about his problems. This triggers an encounter with his guards (they\u2019re pretty upset for some reason, so I have to murder them too), and then I\u2019m able to loot his office and walk away much richer. But one of my companions is now very upset about all the killing and almost leaves the party, until I convince her I did it all for her honor. That doesn\u2019t cheer her up, but she seems worried about \u201cletting me loose\u201d on the world unattended, so she sticks around.See? All the killing was, in fact, very wise. The Outer Worlds is functional and stable for an Obsidian release \u2014 the studio\u2019s games have historically been a little shaky at launch \u2014 but it\u2019s the writing that elevates the experience. Every NPC has a distinct personality, and it\u2019s easy to remember them all after I\u2019ve moved on from their zones, even the one-dimensional joke characters. I feel bad when a companion or important character gets mad at me, because they\u2019re written so well that they feel like, well, people.\n    Related\n  I collect six companions throughout the game, and they\u2019re seeded throughout the main story. They each have unique perks, skills, and abilities: Parvati\u2019s an engineer, Ellie\u2019s a doctor, and so on. I can bring two of them at a time on missions to give me more options to solve problems or just to give me a hand during combat, and the whole party will often banter among themselves, learning more about each other and sharing their own points of view with me.  They\u2019re a bunch of hot messes, honestly, and they have their own lives going on, ranging from being attracted to different NPCs we meet to wanting to hunt down the hidden truth of their religion. I\u2019m heartbroken that I can\u2019t romance them, because Vicar Max is one of the best RPG companions I\u2019ve ever met, and he\u2019s an absolute daddy of a priest.Each zone I explore helps to build up the overall world as well. Edgewater is a town where workers have to rent their own grave sites, newborn babies are corporate assets, and everyone\u2019s ready to report each other to the ruling Board for crimes like \u201cbeing sick\u201d or \u201cnot loving the Board.\u201dAt one point, I spent a good 10 minutes exploring the graveyard. The best workers \u2014 their grave sites are marked with their lifetime earnings \u2014 have sealed steel coffins.

Anyone who can\u2019t pay is thrown into a ditch.Obsidian does not pull any punches with The Outer Worlds: Capitalism is an ever-present, inescapable force that is rotting the Halcyon system. The injustice of it all makes my blood boil, but my companions are there to anchor me, or at least provide more context and nuance. Parvati, a timid engineer, was raised in this society, and she reminds me that the individual workers don\u2019t know any alternatives to how they currently live their lives. At one point, I ignore her and do something drastic to \u201cfree\u201d a settlement from a corporation\u2019s control. My reward? A man spits in my face. He never asked to be liberated, and from his point of view, I\u2019ve ruined the only life he has ever known.Obsidian has pulled off the delicate task of creating an RPG that feels big while still keeping control of the overall scope of the game itself. There is a galaxy map, but this isn\u2019t No Man\u2019s Sky, with the freedom to completely explore every sprawling world if I choose to. Each planet consists of relatively small zones, so I\u2019m able to focus on my current quest without becoming overwhelmed. These areas are always small enough that I never lose track of the story or my immediate goals, but complex enough that new seeds are constantly being planted for the next area and quest. The Outer Worlds is expansive when it needs to be, but never falls into the trap of believing that bigger is always better. Each area is like a dense little croissant. The environments are bustling with people who feel like they\u2019re a part of a cohesive society. For a capitalist dystopia where people work themselves into their rent-controlled graves, it\u2019s not too bad to explore. And it\u2019s frequently hilarious, if you don\u2019t mind some incredibly dark humor. At one point, I found a gentleman wearing a giant, terrifying moon mask. No matter what I asked him, he just cheerfully redirected the conversation to the amazing wares of Spacer\u2019s Choice. Can he eat in there? Isn\u2019t it hot? Is that a rat I saw in the mask? He kept a poker face until I asked him if I could try it on. Then, his facade broke, and he pleaded with me to move on and never darken his door with such a suggestion again. It\u2019s touches like this that make hanging out in a dystopia fun, and I can\u2019t wait to go back. The Outer Worlds will be released Oct. 25 on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.

On one side was a community of outsiders frustrated by corporate control. Their outpost was something like a worker\u2019s paradise\u2014they were well fed and mostly happy, surviving by relying on each other. I admired their leader, Adelaide, for the passion that she had for her people. On the other side was the corporate-owned town they left, led by Reed Tobson, an idiot that didn\u2019t seem to realize that asking his workers to only eat canned fish (for protein!) led to the population being ravaged by plagues. Despite how much I hated Tobson, he was right that the people working for him suffered because of the workers that had abandoned the town to form their own community.I still don\u2019t know if I did the right thing.The choice I would make would destroy one of these two communities permanently. I managed to find an in-between option, which disbanded the outpost of deserters but also allowed for deep reforms in the town. I was satisfied with this for a short while, but when I got back to my ship, I saw that I\u2019d received a bit of memorabilia from my adventure: a town sign. As I sidled up to examine it, its description told me that I had taught the deserters something important about their dream of a life without corporations: to never dream.The universe that The Outer Worlds takes place in is bleak.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0f944e9-174f-4eb2-8e88-31a3eca103b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0f944e9-174f-4eb2-8e88-31a3eca103b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c21b75d-6b7c-4f89-9a87-fdb381f1f10f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "22b1e478c32b45c69eaba5ab2f607aea7be4c2c96cb367f44936d554b47244e9"}, "3": {"node_id": "b73feec6-3dee-41d2-8f15-a568420972a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bed7f6aadcef4934dfb0ae08806286f5e94912f8452f9ab1a39a03bcb0cd1920"}}, "hash": "298721e90aaa8e1440225217d2d8b4461d668901d512f71a08147060edc95756", "text": "Halcyon is a corporate-owned colony consisting of two planets of workers, a mining outpost on an asteroid, a ship called the Groundbreaker that acts as a waystation for groups of workers going to and fro, and a prison planet. Things are in dire straits, as the workers suffer low wages and long hours while the wealthy live in a gilded city, unconcerned with their plight. Several questions drive the game: How do you create the ideal society? And who is at fault for bringing this one to its knees? What adequate punishment exists for those responsible, if there is one at all? The Outer Worlds acts as a mirror this way; you answer these questions via the myriad choices you can make in the game, your moral standing met with visible consequences. You can also avoid all these questions in favor of just shooting everyone you see and taking everything in sight, though as time goes on, you will see how your selfishness affects the people around you.You play a variable that the corporations hadn\u2019t accounted for in their quest for total economic and social control. The scientist (and outlaw) Phineas Welles has unfrozen you from 70 years of cryogenic sleep. You were a passenger on the colony ship The Hope, which houses some of the greatest scientists, artists, and philosophers Earth had to offer but never made it to its destination after being knocked out of its planned route. With their help, Welles thinks that Halcyon can recover, but he needs you to find the chemicals he needs to wake up the rest of the colonists, who have been frozen for so long that they would otherwise experience what Welles calls \u201cexplosive cell death\u201d upon being thawed. Your perspective as someone outside of the colony is one that will eventually shape its future.For players concerned about Obsidian\u2019s past issues with buggy releases, you can breathe a sigh of relief. The game isn\u2019t quite bug free\u2014my game had a hard time whenever I visited the abandoned, monster infested town of Cascadia, with texture pop-in and longer loading times, and for some reason it believed that one of my companions was dead, making it impossible to finish their personal quest (and snagging me a deadpan explanation that they didn\u2019t survive at the end of the game). Neither of these issues were exactly game-breaking for me, and my playthrough didn\u2019t suffer for them. This is the Obsidian game that people have been begging for: one with polish.\"What happens to a dream deferred?\"Class struggle simulatorExtremely thoughtful writing paired with gunplay that's just as sharp.Because the game sets the bar high, the places where the writing doesn't go far enough are glaring.ObsidianPlayStation 4 (played), Xbox One, PC, Switch (eventually)October 25, 2019Around 40 hoursBeing frozen for 70 years has some advantages: You gain \u201ctactical time dilation,\u201d which allows you to slow down time for combat. By slowing down time, you can target specific body parts that will temporarily give your enemies debuffs. Shooting an enemy in the eyes will blind them, making their shots less accurate. It\u2019ll also allow you to reposition yourself, to peek out of cover with just enough time to take down an enemy and run to waist-high wall.The weapons themselves are fun enough to use that even though I tried to talk myself out of violence as much as I could, I never dreaded violence when it occurred. You can find and buy different modifications for your weapons and armor that change how they work, making almost every weapon and armor set work for every playstyle. If you like the hunting rifles but need something that takes out the automechanicals (robots that often have guns), you can add a mod that changes their damage type to shock rather than physical. If you like a certain set of heavy armor but need to sneak by a couple enemies, you can modify that set of armor so that the sounds of your footsteps are quieter.The Outer Worlds serves the player\u2019s needs mechanically at every turn. As you level up, you can unlock perks for even more abilities, like the capacity to carry more items, recharge your tactical time dilation faster, or get a little health with each kill. You can also take on flaws, which will allow you to unlock another perk while giving a permanent debuff to your character. Flaws unlock based on your own weaknesses as a player.

Yes, The Outer Worlds mechanically resembles the Fallout series. It was made by the same team that worked on the first two Fallout games as well as Fallout: New Vegas. It\u2019s built on the skeleton of Dungeons and Dragons, with the player assigning points in perception and intelligence in character creation and as you level up. You will have to pass checks on those stats to unlock dialogue options that allow you to finish quests in different ways. This is not dissimilar to what Fallout has become under the ownership of Bethesda, though I will say that I have not felt as motivated to finish Fallout 3 or 4 as I felt to finish The Outer Worlds. The writing is centered, focused on getting the player to confront its class struggle, the universe built with that goal in mind. As a bonus, it\u2019s also quite funny. Early on in the game, I laughed as a corporate guard told me that they were busy dealing with marauders, and worse: parking violators.You and your band of companions will eventually uncover some dark truths about Halcyon. From there, you can reshape it to fit whatever your vision of humanity\u2019s potential is. For some, this will be a reflection of what their politics already are. As a socialist, I knew that whatever I ended up doing would be in the service of a colony that put the rights of workers first. Others who are more sympathetic to corporatism and capitalism will also have paths to enact their visions. If you see fit, you can even side against the scientist who unfroze you, Welles. The Outer Worlds will challenge you to make hard choices in your quest to find a better way of life, offering viewpoints that run directly counter to your own in a way that always felt fair and compelling. By the end of the game, I felt like I understood my own politics better.The key to making this feel naturalistic is by challenging the player to really commit to their ideals. When I first encountered the Iconoclasts, a faction of sorta socialists that are dedicated to their cause with a cult-like fervor, their community starved under a leader who spent far more time on empty rhetoric than on praxis. (In a turn that made me laugh, he\u2019s also a former journalist.) It\u2019s safe to say that the leader of the Iconoclasts is a pretty bad person, but on the other hand, under the control of the corporations, workers don\u2019t have bathroom breaks or weekends. If you play your cards right, you\u2019re probably going to find a way to stay true to yourself without leaving people in power that aren\u2019t serving their communities. But in order to get that far, you\u2019ll have to actively care, and the game provides enough deep character writing to give you avenues to care about what happens to the people of Halcyon.You companions act as guideposts to the many different walks of life that make up Halcyon. Their personal quest lines reveal as much about these characters as the world itself. Parvati is so used to not belonging that when she meets someone that she\u2019s interested in romantically, she doesn\u2019t know how to handle it. Her quest is both an examination of what it is like to be a square peg unable to fit in a round hole as much as it is a touching queer love story. Vicar Max, like other followers of his faith, is looking for peace in some kind of grand design, to make an uncertain world make sense. He is also, as the kids would say, daddy. One of my favorites, Felix, is an orphan who is fleeing Groundbreaker after starting a fight with his foreman over sports. He isn\u2019t well-read, but his convictions are strong\u2014he doesn\u2019t need to study theory to know that workers are being exploited. Your companions will have strong reactions to the main story quests and the decisions you make in them. In fact, it was Parvati\u2019s reactions in that first quest that led me to the choices I ended up making.No matter your politics, you\u2019re not going to finish The Outer Worlds without addressing issues of labor head-on. I\u2019m a union rep for Kotaku, and at times playing this game reminded me of the things we talk about in our meetings: How do we meet the needs of the workers, how do we placate the bosses?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f00575cc-e4c1-4b6a-aa69-828d8a2c9dd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f00575cc-e4c1-4b6a-aa69-828d8a2c9dd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "b73feec6-3dee-41d2-8f15-a568420972a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bed7f6aadcef4934dfb0ae08806286f5e94912f8452f9ab1a39a03bcb0cd1920"}, "3": {"node_id": "02922a91-f767-4b07-9883-e429300816ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe745a4c6b6f2a011eaed5e3bba257cb40b151c74b48b4023f86d42a3dc1f444"}}, "hash": "82108452870a83889d2a49136656521335bd0fc16fc955aed6b0b01744525715", "text": "As someone not contracted by a corporation, you\u2019re referred to as a \u201cfreelancer\u201d by quest givers, which amused me. One quest even had me negotiating between striking workers and their boss. Labor is at the center of everything in Halcyon. The issues that are destroying the colony are directly related to the division of wealth between bosses and workers. Halcyon feels full and complete\u2014at the edges of your understanding of its history lies the implication that nearly a century of life has unfolded in this colony.As my time in Halcyon went on, I ended up parsing what the game was asking me to think about through the Langston Hughes poem \u201cHarlem.\u201d What happens to a dream deferred, in space? Throughout the game you will see the result of dreams that have festered, dried up, crusted over. Once I got that idea in my head, it was hard not to notice the limitations of such a laser-focused pursuit to interrogate class struggle.Halcyon being called a colony certainly made me bristle at times, though conveniently, there are no sentient races that the colonizers have displaced. In The Outer Worlds, all social problems are filtered through class. Sexism and racism don\u2019t meaningfully exist even though race does; many of the people you meet across classes are black and brown. Race and gender go essentially unacknowledged from the game\u2019s core narrative to its tongue-in-cheek riffs on PR buzzwords, which was frustrating in a game so deeply embroiled in power dynamics. In our world, class and race are inexorably tied, and a world in which questions of class are more eternal than questions of race strikes me as dishonest. I trust in Obsidian to broach those issues with the same grace as they do issues of class, so I wish they had gone there.The Outer Worlds is so impactful that it made me question and ultimately settle more thoughtfully into my beliefs. My game ended with what felt like a utopian, worker-led vision for Halcyon, and the game gives you the room to enact whatever your personal vision may be. It pushed me without feeling preachy and gave me some fun shootouts between the politicking. In the end, The Outer Worlds aligns itself with Hughes. The dream of paradise that Halcyon has deferred exploded. How you pick up those pieces is up to you, for better or worse.\nUSgamer, \nIn an alternative timeline, Bethesda made Fallout 5 instead of 76 and cleaned up its bugs.That imaginary timeline isn't far from the Hellscape we inhabit in 2019, except it's Bethesda buddies Obsidian that have taken the Fallout formula, cleaned up the sloppy implementation and refined an adventure RPG that has all the early signs of evolving into its own series. The Outer Worlds may reach across planets, but it's smaller in scale that Fallout 4 and New Vegas. It's a focused game with a joyously conceived world, society and politics, making exploration and conversation with the locals flow like swirling currents. You're unlikely to get lost or lose track of your objectives when such snappy dialogue tumbles out of mouths. There's always a zinging one-liner to give you a sign-posted push in the right direction. Who doesn't want to flirt with a pharmacist for free drugs? Why would you say no to a mission that asks you to retrieve dinosaur robot porn?\n\nAlthough you're exploring multiple planets and space stations, it's as familiar as the Wasteland or Commonwealth. The Outer Worlds is draped in sci-fi Americana, with a little bit of the Wild West thrown in for good measure. It has its own version of VATS where you slow down time to pinpoint better shots and cause more damage. It has a wealth of perks to choose from, sassy companions who need your help, and romantic dilemmas to get involved with. You will hack, loot, upgrade at benches and sneak past guards who really should be able to spot a party of three knee-crouching like something out of a bad panto. There's even a cute mascot or two to rival Vault Boy. An early part of the main questline has you wrestle with a big moral decision like you're back in Nuketown playing with The Power of the Atom. Todd Howard must be doing his nut in.Still, while it borrows heavily from Bethesda to the point of someone from the legal department drafting a stern letter, it's also confident in its own strengths. The clear highlight of The Outer Worlds is its dialogue and characters. The locals are quick witted, or drunk and stupid, horny, aggressive, depressed, pissed off, cynical, caustic, hyped up, ignorant, condescending and angry.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02922a91-f767-4b07-9883-e429300816ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "02922a91-f767-4b07-9883-e429300816ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "f00575cc-e4c1-4b6a-aa69-828d8a2c9dd5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "82108452870a83889d2a49136656521335bd0fc16fc955aed6b0b01744525715"}, "3": {"node_id": "98431d9f-953f-4229-8c2c-929175bbbd28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c067513aa818690bef0ae5a512fbb30e3bcf8d921f3f5a90bd08953cd9d9b61"}}, "hash": "fe745a4c6b6f2a011eaed5e3bba257cb40b151c74b48b4023f86d42a3dc1f444", "text": "They're a hoot, and it feels like every branch of conversation spins off into its own drama, tale of revenge, loss or friendship. It's refreshing and noticeable that the world isn't populated by boring white men asking you to do gruff military stuff. One of the first romance options you come across isn't about your personal love interests, but trying to facilitate a get together between two characters admiring each other from afar. It's genuinely sweet, even for a cynical, old, black-hearted bastard like myself. There's a lot more fun to be had spending quality time with the locals than fighting the mercenaries and monsters that lurk outside of town.  \n \n\"For those that were disappointed with Fallout 76 going online multiplayer, this is the single-player RPG you've been looking for\"That's not to say combat is bad, but it is flavourless. The Outer Worlds is a better RPG and adventure game than a shooter, so it's a shame that it litters unexplored areas with so many enemies. It can feel like a slog churning through them to get to the next interesting populace. Enemy AI tends to default between charging like a bloke on a Saturday after nine pints, or just floating in the distance spitting venom and bullets at you. Your best approach is either send in your companions to do the dirty work, unload everything you have, or run away. There's also an abundance of cash and ammo on the default settings, which may be an admission that you'll want to blast through combat to get to the better bits. If violence and risk is your thing, tougher difficulties will make your companions mortal. But again, I'd rather try a second playthrough with a different attitude and stats than simply making combat harder.And while it borrows from the best, it doesn't stretch itself or risk innovation. The Outer Worlds never goes too deep in any one direction. Sure, you can upgrade and tinker with your stats, but you'll never get lost in the system or fall down a rabbit hole to really refine your character build. There's a neat little flaw system in play that adapts to your style; if you get your ass kicked by a lot of robots, for example, you can choose to accept a phobia and weakened stats in exchange for an extra perk. It's a shame then that perks are so functional. They may help you carry more, or do more damage, but there's little of the inventiveness of Fallout's vampire Hematophage perk, or the Mysterious Stranger. That feels like a missed opportunity in a game brimming with wit, but maybe it's something that would develop for a sequel. It also commits a few basic RPG sins we thought were on their way to the bin in 2019, such as forcing you to choose stats before you've barely played the game. But when it's hitting you with good gags at character creation with all the perky confidence of a Barden Bella on enrollment day, it's a niggle you can forgive quite easily.  \n \nIt doesn't feel right to praise a game for not having ugly or game-breaking bugs, but it's something we associate with this genre of sprawling single-player RPG. In The Outer Worlds' case then, Bethesda should really take note. Aside from some basic pop-up entering larger areas, I've come across no evidence of weird graphical glitches, busted questlines, disappearing items, weird animations or any of the other sloppiness we've become used to in recent Fallout games. Congratulations on not being broken, The Outer Worlds. That said, this is a much less physical world than Bethesda\u2019s, which are usually littered with props that the game has to remember the location of. Most of The Outer Worlds\u2019 items exist in menus.  I usually play these games with a build that errs on the side of violence when it comes down to it. I'm happy to play with a nasty attitude and blunder through killing and insulting people if I think there's more in it for me. But The Outer Worlds had me considering my violent acts, pulling me back from the brink on a number of occasions when I thought I'd already made my mind up how to deal with a situation. That's a testament to the great writing and characterisation, and it's this that The Outer Worlds should be celebrated for above all else.The Outer Worlds serves a need and fills a gap very neatly at the end of this console generation. The charm of The Outer Worlds lends itself to water-cooler tales and other moments to share, and certainly more than one playthrough adopting alternative styles. It's safe, but very welcoming.

Virtuos is the developer behind the port, tasked with squashing down the Obsidian Entertainment creation to play nicely with the less powerful Nintendo Switch. We were blown away with\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0when we played it on PS4 Pro, so how does it hold up on Nintendo\u2019s hybrid home-portable console? Here\u2019s our verdict.Coming in at a relatively impressive 13.7 GB in size,\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0fits onto a game cartridge with plenty of room to spare. While other titles have suffered a loss in audio fidelity due to over-compression to get the game to fit,\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0Switch version sounds solid to me. This is the full experience, too, so there was no need to cut content to save space.The Switch edition features motion controls, using the console\u2019s gyroscope. Players can opt to aim by rotating a detached Joy-Con.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1f83a07-0612-45ad-be91-c6bdf275321f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1f83a07-0612-45ad-be91-c6bdf275321f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "98431d9f-953f-4229-8c2c-929175bbbd28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c067513aa818690bef0ae5a512fbb30e3bcf8d921f3f5a90bd08953cd9d9b61"}, "3": {"node_id": "de0f2384-7e03-4b5e-a849-5925c6747b48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b414979c6684cf81c4677dae726e812d81a43fc55c628a0d051b17065cf883f7"}}, "hash": "6009cbe85c08b42d29c5b04f87920a0c2a12aedc6c937ce30a6ca6b2cabc898a", "text": "Players can opt to aim by rotating a detached Joy-Con. I didn\u2019t find this to be useful at all, but hey, it\u2019s an option and it might work well for others.Of course, the biggest advantage of playing\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0on Switch is the portability factor. You can now enjoy a fantastic Obsidian RPG on a handheld, a feat that\u2019s still hard to believe despite my many hours with the game.Of course, non-Lite players can still dock their system and play on the big screen. Though, I\u2019d personally advise against doing that as it turns the already heavily compromised visuals into an even bigger mess. This gets worse the bigger the external display is.This is where things get ugly, unfortunately. While it should be obvious that a game like\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0is going to suffer compromises when moving to less powerful hardware, I was still surprised by the downgraded visuals. Something had to give in order to keep performance at an acceptable level, and it quickly becomes obvious that the \u201csomething\u201d was a crisp resolution.As you\u2019ll see in the majority of screenshots that I\u2019ve captured while playing,\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0can get very, very blurry. While the output resolution is 720p portable and 1080p docked, it\u2019s clear that upscaling from a lower resolution is often used to keep the experience as close to 30 FPS as possible.It\u2019s a shame to see what is such a fantastic-looking game on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, crushed down to look like this. There are no graphics options to fiddle around with, either, which are what ultimately helped save\u00a0The Witcher 3 on Switch\u00a0from looking like a puddle of Vaseline.Overall stability of the frame-rate is mostly fine. However, in larger gunfights or when moving more quickly through the world, you can sometimes suffer the occasional hiccup. Both docked and portable play had these rare stutters, but they were infrequent enough to only be minor annoyances.I\u2019m happy that frame-rate has been given the priority, especially for a game with a first-person perspective and gameplay that requires reasonably speedy aim, but it comes at a much greater cost than I was expecting.I should also mention load times, which are a little long. Saving the game is very quick, however, which is important for a title like this where players may want to rechoose dialogue options or approach a fight differently. The game supports multiple save files, so you can go wild.If you can get past the greasy look of the game, you\u2019ll still find\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u2018 gameplay\u00a0underneath. The awesome class and weapon customization will still keep you busy as you become more powerful and try out new tools. Tough decisions still need to be made, and you\u2019ll see them impact the world in positive and negative ways. You\u2019ll also still be able to appreciate the variety in scenery across different planets.Characters are well-acted and vibrant, with their own little quirks giving them that extra bit of personality. This often makes it tricky to choose which faction to side with, especially if you\u2019re used to trying to keep everyone happy in other games. There are multiple ways to play out the adventure, which invites a replay or two.Some of the characters you meet will offer to join you as a companion. Companions in other RPGs can often hold you back or require you to babysit them, but in\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0they are incredibly useful. Helping to bolster the player\u2019s statistics is one advantage, but companions also have their own abilities that can save the day against a big mob of enemies or a particularly tough boss.Again, there is still a lot to enjoy here. Obsidian made a damn good game, creating a\u00a0Fallout-style RPG with its own unique strengths, which is now playable on the go.While the game\u2019s blurry presentation has me recommending any other version of\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0over this Switch edition, if you have to play on the Nintendo handheld, then there are a few ways you can handle the compromised experience.The aim assist and easy difficulty option both help to make challenging combat easier to handle and less stressful. While controls are decently responsive, intense combat can still be tricky. Keep the aim assist on and consider playing on easy to help balance out any accuracy fails.I chose to avoid sniper builds and focus on melee, in addition to leadership. This meant that I didn\u2019t have to worry about pinpoint accuracy and I was able to rely on my companions\u2019 fast ability cooldowns to make fights easier.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de0f2384-7e03-4b5e-a849-5925c6747b48": {"__data__": {"id_": "de0f2384-7e03-4b5e-a849-5925c6747b48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1f83a07-0612-45ad-be91-c6bdf275321f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6009cbe85c08b42d29c5b04f87920a0c2a12aedc6c937ce30a6ca6b2cabc898a"}, "3": {"node_id": "07ff6c51-8fc4-4775-a5ef-be854ef01af4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "90942e5a47a367e89d3ea81b0f4996b277bb25f1db1eaaae659718b3da19a601"}}, "hash": "b414979c6684cf81c4677dae726e812d81a43fc55c628a0d051b17065cf883f7", "text": "Investing points into buffing the Tactical Time Dilation is also wise, as it allows you to constantly be slowing down time to land shots.Obviously it\u2019s not great that I felt the need to go down a specific customization path just to handle the combat, but fighting is only one aspect of\u00a0The Outer Worlds. There is still a lot of enjoyable gameplay to be had with interacting with characters and exploring the wild landscapes.It\u2019s unfortunate that\u00a0The Witcher 3\u00a0on Switch set the bar so high for handheld ports. While it also had its compromises, it still managed to retain the charm of one of the best games of all time, with the options to disable Motion Blur and Blur, as well as to increase Sharpening, coming in clutch to save it.The Outer Worlds\u00a0on Switch is too heavily compromised in the visuals department for me to recommend it above any other version of the game. However,\u00a0for owners of the Nintendo Switch and no other supported system, then there is still plenty to love here, provided you can stomach the full price at launch.This was of the greatest games of 2019 and is still worthy of playing, but you\u2019ll need to prepare yourself for the blur.\u00a0It\u2019s still\u00a0The Outer Worlds, provided you squint a little!The Outer Worlds was reviewed on an original Nintendo Switch with code provided by the publisher.

It touches every cornerstone of a\u00a0Fallout\u00a0game, from the camera zooming in on an NPC\u2019s face when you strike up a conversation with them, through to enemies crumpling up in an awkward pile of physics when you kill them with a critical shot. Developer Obsidian\u00a0isn\u2019t exactly shy of its influence. However, branding\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0as \u201cFallout, but in space\u201d would be doing a disservice to what the studio has achieved here; if\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0were a\u00a0Fallout\u00a0game, it\u2019d arguably be the best\u00a0Fallout\u00a0game ever.The comparisons between\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0and Bethesda\u2019s post-apocalyptic series are immediate and obvious. It\u2019s a first-person, open-world action RPG set in a struggling star system filled with morally dubious characters who can be attacked, bartered with, and befriended. Players are aided in combat by Tactical Time Dilation, which allows them to slow time in order to land critical shots with greater ease. Quests can have multiple outcomes and will force you to make tough decisions, such as whether to divert power to an established community struggling with plague and famine, or divert it to a thriving band of deserters. It shares more in common with\u00a0New Vegas\u00a0than\u00a0Fallout 3\u00a0or 4, which is understandable considering Obsidian developed the 2010 spin-off. Its utilization of an overarching faction reputation system also contributes to it feeling more like a\u00a0New Vegas\u00a0spiritual successor than a\u00a0sci-fi\u00a0Fallout 5.But while Bethesda may have fallen into the deep end after fundamentally misunderstanding its audience with\u00a0Fallout 76,\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0takes what that audience loves and expands on it. The end result is a sprawling adventure that feels like it could have been published by Bethesda, while also outright removing many of the flaws and mistakes of its source of inspiration. It\u2019s well-polished, ambitious, and boasts a gripping central story that continues to ramp up the stakes until its satisfying conclusion.The Outer Worlds\u00a0places you in the player-created shoes of a survivor of the Hope, a colony ship that seemingly disappeared without a trace after being sent to help colonize the Halcyon star system. You\u2019re rescued by the eccentric Phineas Wells, a rogue scientist on the run from the sinister Board, the entity which controls all of Halcyon. Waking up from a deep cryosleep, you must go in search of more information about the Board, the Hope, and the future of the Halcyon system.You navigate the system in your ship, the charmingly titled \u2018The Unreliable,\u2019 previously owned by the AWOL Captain Hawthorne. The Captain is AWOL because your escape pod crashed on top of him and killed him in\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u2018 opening scenes, but you now have the added bonus of assuming his identity whenever anyone asks you for ID. Or you can play it straight and give them the truth.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07ff6c51-8fc4-4775-a5ef-be854ef01af4": {"__data__": {"id_": "07ff6c51-8fc4-4775-a5ef-be854ef01af4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "de0f2384-7e03-4b5e-a849-5925c6747b48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b414979c6684cf81c4677dae726e812d81a43fc55c628a0d051b17065cf883f7"}, "3": {"node_id": "a700faa2-1149-497a-8ab8-178dac8b2ca2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b77ea2fcb76bc9a5f1d15fb0fe0b7f93198bdf8c05d56cd078aadc7e741dcafd"}}, "hash": "90942e5a47a367e89d3ea81b0f4996b277bb25f1db1eaaae659718b3da19a601", "text": "Or you can play it straight and give them the truth. Or you can attack them and make them wish they never asked you in the first place. The star system is your oyster in\u00a0The Outer Worlds, and there are multiple ways to solve each problem it presents.There\u2019s no all-encompassing karma system, with your choices instead affecting your reputation with each faction you encounter. Keep working in favor of one faction and they\u2019ll grow to revere you, but if it\u2019s to the detriment of another faction they\u2019ll eventually learn to despise you and attack you on sight. Across both its main and side quests, you\u2019ll be faced with numerous tough moral decisions to make, and rarely does the decision feel clear-cut good or evil. In my second playthrough, I attempted to play as selfishly as possible, but the dialogue is so engrossing and the characters so sympathetic and well-acted that I found it genuinely difficult to detach myself from its story to do so.In certain quests, you\u2019ll find yourself faced with a decision that will have devastating ramifications on one community but greatly benefit the other. However, even in those quests, there are smaller choices you can make leading up to this decision that might help you reach an amicable conclusion. There\u2019s also the possibility that you\u2019ll play your cards wrong and botch the quest altogether, preventing you from completing it in the process. While there\u2019s no right or wrong way to complete a quest, there are certainly more satisfying outcomes. These are typically achieved with more legwork, whether that be completing the optional quests included in a certain objective, or talking to involved parties who may offer you additional helpful information.Due to Obsidian presenting players with very few instances of good vs. bad, there\u2019s a distinct lack of a primary antagonist. You meet characters that get on your bad side, and you know that the Board isn\u2019t to be trusted, but for much of the game your player-character is without an arch-nemesis. This works when it comes to dealing with the conflicts of the planets you visit, but not when it comes to tackling the overarching threat of the Board.The Board is a mostly silent oppressor, with its stranglehold on Halcyon initially being explained to you in conversation with its dissatisfied colonists. You know that it\u2019s the puppeteer of the system that seems to be asleep at the wheel, with various communities in its regime struggling for survival while its members seemingly thrive. It\u2019s a story about the evils of the sci-fi one-percenters, though given\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u2018 penchant for exploring the moral grey areas rather than the black and whites, its message isn\u2019t as simple as \u201ccapitalism bad.\u201d Making the \u201cright\u201d decision in the game usually isn\u2019t as simple as outright siding with the dissenters, even though it\u2019s clear from your surroundings that the Board\u2019s methods aren\u2019t working as well as they\u2019d like you to believe.The Outer Worlds\u00a0is set in an alternate future where President William McKinley wasn\u2019t assassinated, allowing him to serve his full second term and continue his support of big business. This leads to the 23rd century being dominated by megacorporations, who have ventured far beyond Earth and now govern the alien planets they\u2019ve colonized. The exact timeframe of all this space travel and terraforming is muddled; each planet retains the same retrofuturistic aesthetic, coupling space marine armor and science weapons with 1950s-era posters and saloons.While these inconsistencies can certainly be ignored, it doesn\u2019t give\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0its own visual identity. Perhaps this was a conscious decision to lure in the\u00a0Fallout\u00a0fans, but even transporting another era into space like the \u201970s or \u201980s would have been preferable. Instead, its ramshackle buildings and the fashion sense of those living in them feels derivative. If \u2018I Don\u2019t Want to Set the World on Fire\u2019 started playing on my ship\u2019s speakers, I wouldn\u2019t have second-guessed it.Fortunately, the planets themselves look gorgeous. Their pastel color palette is reminiscent of\u00a0No Man\u2019s Sky, while their skyboxes are filled with the nearby planets you can see on your ship\u2019s navigation system. Looking up in the sky and being curious about a distant planet, then being able to travel over to it later, makes the game\u2019s series of relatively small open-world environments feel massive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a700faa2-1149-497a-8ab8-178dac8b2ca2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a700faa2-1149-497a-8ab8-178dac8b2ca2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "07ff6c51-8fc4-4775-a5ef-be854ef01af4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "90942e5a47a367e89d3ea81b0f4996b277bb25f1db1eaaae659718b3da19a601"}, "3": {"node_id": "85d7fdca-3c27-44e0-9225-e26a40fb0ec2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c7ef73faa548b144f949c0de1a762c81aac2109aa3e68e443841e5ec93064377"}}, "hash": "b77ea2fcb76bc9a5f1d15fb0fe0b7f93198bdf8c05d56cd078aadc7e741dcafd", "text": "While they aren\u2019t exactly busy outside of their designated communities\u00a0\u2014 don\u2019t expect many random quests to pop up while you\u2019re out exploring\u00a0\u2014 there\u2019s a fast travel system that eradicates all of the unnecessary wandering you\u2019d otherwise have to do. This ensures that hopping between objectives is never laborious, and most exploring you do is out of choice, not necessity.I was also taken aback by how few glitches I encountered during my playthroughs, considering that Obsidian\u2019s last crack at the\u00a0Fallout\u00a0whip was the infamously buggy\u00a0New Vegas. Aside from a smattering of physics-related problems after killing enemies in firefights, not one notable issue in this department crept in during my 40+ hours with the game. While it may be capped at 30 FPS on PS4 Pro, I never experienced any noticeable dips, and everything ran smoothly from beginning to end.Combat isn\u2019t the most interesting aspect of\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0on the surface, though remains consistently exciting throughout.\u00a0By providing its own spin on VATs with Tactical Time Dilation, you\u2019re granted the opportunity to systematically take down enemies in fun and gruesome firefights. TTD allows you to slow down time and aim your shots better, along with displaying information on-screen indicating what each shot will do. If you aim for the eyes, you can disorientate your attacker, or aiming for their weak point might land a critical hit and bring them to their knees. Entering into pseudo-bullet time and slow-mo shooting at a giant mantiqueen\u2019s belly retains the pace of the action, unlike VATs pulling you out into a boring menu, while also allowing you to deal out massive damage while feeling like a hugely overpowered gunslinger.Melee weapons don\u2019t fare as well as ranged weapons, with close-quarters combat being trickier to handle in first-person and many tougher enemies dealing massive damage when up close. However, particularly in the late game, you eventually get access to some monstrously overpowered equipment that\u2019s a blast to use. There are more than a few guns and melee weapons tucked into\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0which dramatically turn the tide in your favor, and while it doesn\u2019t threaten\u00a0Borderlands 3\u2018s zany arsenal of firearms, they still pack an almighty punch.Despite bringing the \u201950s to space,\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0left behind its social politics. The companions you can recruit throughout your journey are a diverse group, ranging from Max, the hilariously embittered vicar, through to Nyoka, a drunk big game hunter. Each brings something unique to the table, both in terms of their personality and the special abilities they can perform in battle. They also have their own equipable perks, which can grant you bonuses both in and out of conflict, along with providing you with advice during tough decisions.AI teammates are always a difficult proposition given their propensity to do the opposite of what you want, and\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0sometimes skirts this fine line. Without leveling up the specific skill dedicated to healing them, they\u2019re difficult to keep alive, being much more willing to throw themselves in the line of gunfire than you\u2019d like. Fortunately, their aggressiveness and the range in which they do combat can be altered, ensuring that they won\u2019t attack unless explicitly told to do so. After investing points into increasing their respective abilities, I also swiftly found that my little team was able to decimate swathes of enemies at will.It\u2019s all a matter of how much you want to invest in them, but with the option of also being able to leave them behind on the Unreliable, if you\u2019re more of a lone wolf then you needn\u2019t worry about them getting in your way. Still, you\u2019d be missing out on the camaraderie that helps drive\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u2018 story of a plucky band of survivors fighting back against the big bad Board. While there are no tangible improvements in your relationships with your companions as you progress (i.e. no romance options), just having them along for the ride adds personality to your quests. Whether they\u2019re having little arguments with each other, or poking their head in to offer their unsolicited thoughts on a shady quest-giver, it makes you feel like Picard beaming down from the Enterprise with a couple of members of Starfleet.Of course, you don\u2019t have to be as Lawful Good as Picard, and it often feels like\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0doesn\u2019t want you to be. During conversations, specialized dialog options will routinely present themselves if you have a high enough level in that particular skill.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85d7fdca-3c27-44e0-9225-e26a40fb0ec2": {"__data__": {"id_": "85d7fdca-3c27-44e0-9225-e26a40fb0ec2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "a700faa2-1149-497a-8ab8-178dac8b2ca2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b77ea2fcb76bc9a5f1d15fb0fe0b7f93198bdf8c05d56cd078aadc7e741dcafd"}, "3": {"node_id": "bd6520a7-0501-477e-98ab-d3a5545cc24c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d78bd82a8caa007fe4df1d0c644223ae72d38c297727905444e8ec3c25a60002"}}, "hash": "c7ef73faa548b144f949c0de1a762c81aac2109aa3e68e443841e5ec93064377", "text": "For instance, you may be able to lie about the disturbing fertilization methods used by a community leader, or you could intimidate a guard into stepping aside and allowing you entry into a restricted area. These present unique solutions to challenging problems, though it does feel like it\u2019s far too easy to talk your way out of situations.There is no downside to using one of these specialized dialog options, as they will always be successful if your skill level is high enough. Lying to someone, even if that person is a high-standing community member, won\u2019t affect your faction reputation, and I never came across someone who responded to my intimidation methods by calling my bluff and attacking me. Given how many variables there are in\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u2019 quests, perhaps the addition of even more deviations from the common path presented would have been too much for Obsidian to implement. However, the lack of repercussions you face can be jarring after you\u2019ve made a particularly cutting remark about someone who really didn\u2019t deserve it.While this element of\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0may be over-simplified, I found myself able to overlook it as a result of the impressive complexity of its branching dialog. In terms of the game\u2019s bigger picture, every action has a suitable reaction and the consequences of my decisions were always logical, even if they were often grim. It\u2019s difficult being the middle-man of a bunch of colonized alien planets, and while I attempted to toe the line between citizens and the looming presence of the Board, doing so while also operating in my own self-interest presented various moral quandaries. In different playthroughs I attempted different solutions, and the stark contrast between the outcome of these solutions was impressive.A game with as much player-choice as\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0has the potential to leave a slew of loose ends behind when the credits roll, but Obsidian ensures that everything is impacted as it should be in your wake. As a result, your decisions feel crucial and important, with you leaving a real impact on each location you visit\u00a0\u2014 for better and for worse. When citizens say that word has got around about your misadventures, you believe them, and it\u2019s suitably depressing to return to a town that you\u2019ve tarnished only for its desperate citizens to start attacking you as soon as you enter the door.For over 40 hours,\u00a0The Outer Worlds\u00a0allowed me to be a space cowboy with all the adventure, intrigue, and danger that came along with it. Planet-hopping throughout Halcyon is one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had in a game in years, introducing me to a cast of sympathetic and interesting characters, throwing me into exciting gunfights, and inundating me with tough decisions to make. This is a must-play for RPG fans, and an absolutely vital game for\u00a0Fallout\u00a0fans.The Outer Worlds review code provided by publisher.

They rocked The Old Republic for BioWare and continued the Neverwinter Nights series. Look, they made the best modern Fallout game, New Vegas. Our audience even agrees!In the past nine years they\u2019ve mostly stuck to the Baldur\u2019s Gate-esque Pillars of Eternity series (plus Tyranny), a one-off adventure with a South Park RPG, and a joint MMO venture with Allods Team. What I\u2019m saying is: I want more Obsidian in my life.And with The Outer Worlds, a massive first-person RPG in the same vein as New Vegas, I got it.The Outer Worlds\u00a0(PC, PS4 [reviewed], Switch, Xbox One) Developer:\u00a0Obsidian Entertainment Publisher: Private Division Released: October 25, 2019 (PC, PS4, XB1) / TBA (Switch) MSRP: $59.99If you were expecting something irreverent and subversive that didn\u2019t take itself too seriously: congratulations, you\u2019re going to love Outer Worlds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd6520a7-0501-477e-98ab-d3a5545cc24c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd6520a7-0501-477e-98ab-d3a5545cc24c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "85d7fdca-3c27-44e0-9225-e26a40fb0ec2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c7ef73faa548b144f949c0de1a762c81aac2109aa3e68e443841e5ec93064377"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0cfada8-117b-4680-96f4-f25460504b4e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "873e8034e841b6b78388f01bae8f5992b1645d212d9515191c65f33a4b2c98c2"}}, "hash": "d78bd82a8caa007fe4df1d0c644223ae72d38c297727905444e8ec3c25a60002", "text": "Our journey takes us to Halcyon: a perfect society \u201cguaranteed to maximize your productivity.\u201d I got immediate Sorry to Bother You\u00a0vibes from the whole professional servitude angle, and one of the first lines of dialogue is \u201cnot likely, bootlickers.\u201d Oh hell yeah, this is my kind of game.Naturally, a rebel group sparks conflict at the start of the game\u2019s events, and that\u2019s where you come in. Said rebel leader cherry-picks one of the many hibernating citizens (you), which is how they cleverly justify the character creation process. Said process, mind, is extremely customizable, allowing you to jack up (or down) various parts of your personality, which impacts skills like melee or ranged attacks, tech, stealth, lock-picking, defense, and dialogue-based options.There\u2019s even a (mostly flavor) \u201captitude\u201d rating that defines your former career/life. For my first playthrough I was a silver-tongued, crackshot cashier, which is another way of saying I was living my best virtual life. The whole system is rife for replays, which plays into the multiple endings angle. After your avatar is good and ready you\u2019ll jet down to a planet surface to help out (or betray) your benefactors. It\u2019s open-ended like that.It must be said upfront: this is\u00a0not\u00a0a fully open world game, and you know what? I\u2019m glad. Zones are broken up into planets or space stations (which you can jet to using your ship), and there isn\u2019t one big map to connect them all. Because of this choice, each zone gets its own chance to breathe a little without the stress involved with pixel-hunting icons (or radio towers) on a map.It helps that my first impression of the initial planet was positive. You can see out into the distant, beautiful horizon, and the segmented approach helps differentiate each area. Due to the isolated nature of the planet-by-planet structure, it\u2019s natural to feel cut off from the universe as a whole; like Outer Worlds\u00a0is smaller than it really is.Thankfully, Obsidian keeps treks (and load times) to a minimum as it focuses on planet-centric storylines without having to hop across the galaxy for errands. The flow kind of reminds me of the new\u00a0God of War, moving around to different medium-to-large-sized zones through a hub interface. Your ship, which houses your companions (yes, this is one of my favorite Obsidian things too), is also home to ADA, your wisecracking AI. It\u2019s safe in some respects, keen to not jettison every modern RPG trope.It\u2019s got marauders (evil flesh-eating mercs, classic), lock picking (though thankfully not a minigame this time, just a button prompt), that sort of familiarity. It\u2019s comfortable at times. But it also has the classic Obsidian charm, filled to the brim with clandestine political discussions, plenty of (well-timed and funny) outbursts of cursing, and that rusted vibrancy aesthetic they do so well. Although walking around can sometimes feel lifeless \u2014 especially when so many buildings are closed or layouts repeat \u2014 that feeling often fades when you see a weird new lifeform or a ship fly by in the sky to remind you that you\u2019re not alone.That humor also pays dividends when you\u2019re doing the actual RPG bits. This is one of those games where you\u2019re often presented with five branching choices, which will spur a lot of save file diversity just to see where it all deviates. You\u2019ll see what I mean when you try to talk down a major confrontation and can\u2019t do it due to a lack of persuasion rating.Just like the Bethesda-era Fallout\u00a0series it draws upon, The Outer Worlds\u2018 bread and butter is first-person combat, but with a time-slow ability (that can be tweaked) instead of V.A.T.S. The emphasis on constant motion makes everything feel more action-oriented as a result, which Obsidian doubles down on with a double-tap/click jump dodge (melee is also formidable in\u00a0Outer Worlds\u00a0because the time-slow mechanic benefits both ranged and close-quarters styles of play). Of course, there\u2019s always the non-violent/stealth option, and interesting optional \u201cflaws\u201d can pop up after messing up one too many times (like\u00a0acrophobia if you fall too much).From a UI perspective, it also isn\u2019t a complete mess on consoles in spite of the complexity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0cfada8-117b-4680-96f4-f25460504b4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0cfada8-117b-4680-96f4-f25460504b4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd6520a7-0501-477e-98ab-d3a5545cc24c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d78bd82a8caa007fe4df1d0c644223ae72d38c297727905444e8ec3c25a60002"}, "3": {"node_id": "e74c0c76-d62a-498c-bde0-0163aac962cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "248e5a3bbe70a7f27131f159ca61fc5dda7a0b3183d92ae57cf56c3d004d944a"}}, "hash": "873e8034e841b6b78388f01bae8f5992b1645d212d9515191c65f33a4b2c98c2", "text": "The inventory system is clean (with an option to instantly mark items as junk and pawn them off en masse), there\u2019s a respec (build change) tool, and best of all, food buffs you for a limited time \u2014 no more pausing the game to spam 25 apples to recover health.You can solve conflicts non-violently through your words, murder everyone, extort them, or chastise them and make them apologize for off-handed comments.\u00a0You\u2019ll also have the chance to convince unsuspecting NPCs that you\u2019re a space inspector instead of confronting them upfront, then kill them when they\u2019re walking away. This sort of openness extends all the way through to the end, where exhaustive satisfying epilogues are provided for all major characters (at least in my case).The absolute highlight of Outer Worlds\u00a0though has to be the companion system. It\u2019s no bullshit, shucking any sort of unfun micromanagement or restrictions. Once you meet a companion you can always quest with them anywhere, and they\u2019ll constantly chime in with their opinion on the task at hand or open up new quests/avenues of play. They passively buff your skills and carrying capacity by just existing, and while the AI is decent by default, you can customize their basic strategy through menu options. Companions also sport over-exaggerated skills (which are supers, really) and can be fully kitted out with their own inventory, gear, and perks. Plus you can have two with you at all times!Although I did not encounter any crashes on PS4, there is jank. Sometimes the game says you\u2019re in combat when you clearly aren\u2019t, forcing you to retreat a bit (or even fast travel) to sort of clean the errant glitchy pipes and allow you to interact with a key item. Companion powers are shaky too, and sometimes buggy (teleporting them across the field instantly), but they\u2019re fun to look at and always connect as a result.An open world game also has to have open world bugs, right? During my playthrough on PS4, I encountered some frame-skipping (nothing too major, unless you\u2019re playing on the max difficulty setting, then it can cause problems), and the game-over screen is super sudden, which is annoying when coupled with an infrequent auto-save system. Loading screens, when they do happen, can approach 30 seconds even on a PS4 Pro.Despite some nominal issues that might be easier for some to hand-wave than others, Obsidian has out-Fallouted recent Fallout efforts. The Outer Worlds is more limited from a size standpoint compared to a lot of other open world adventures, but it makes up for it in charm and a succinct vision without much bloat.[This review is based on a retail copy of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

Experiences like this often leave me thinking about them long after I\u2019m done, and such is the case with The Outer Worlds. From its first moments until its last, players will be asked to make decisions which will alter how the story plays out. Seemingly insignificant moments will come back to bite hours later, and hindsight will force players to second guess their choices and fire up another run.\u00a0In The Outer Worlds, players find themselves waking from hibernation after the ship they\u2019re traveling on goes dark and is abandoned. Their immediate goal, given by Phineas Welles, the stranger that wakes them from cryo-sleep, is to head to a nearby colony to secure resources and wake the remaining passengers aboard the ship. This kicks off a journey that sees players trying to make sense of a world that, on the surface seems stable, but is struggling against the immense pressure of corporate greed.Once given control things begin in similar fashion to many open-world games. Players create their ideal character both aesthetically and by allotting skill points to shape how they wish to play. The game will run through a tutorial mission that teaches the ins and outs of movement, stealth, dialogue, and both melee and ranged combat. This tutorial mission leads to the Unreliable, a ship that serves as a personal hub throughout the experience. It\u2019s complete with a map to travel to different planets, personal quarters to store items, and a workbench to tinker, modify, repair, or break down gear. Soon enough, though, the training wheels come off and players are given total control to shape the events of almost every moment of The Outer Worlds.Truthfully, it took me a few hours to really get my feet under me in The Outer Worlds. I was engaging in every conversation and exploring all dialogue options. This led to a quest page full of things to do all over the game\u2019s first planet, Terra 2. I even recruited my first companion, but, as someone who\u2019d recently woken from hibernation and been dropped off on a strange world, I was figuring it all out. I wasn\u2019t seeing the complete picture.My first major task was to decide the fate of two opposing groups of people, but I had lots of side quests to deal with along the path. The path, by the way, was littered with enemies like humans, robots, and alien beasts. To my surprise, only once was combat challenging on the default difficulty, and I didn\u2019t initially understand it to appreciate all the moving parts.\u00a0What I failed to realize in my first hours was the depth combat could have with the right skills and perks. Bump Leadership and companions can unleash devastating special attacks. Add a few points to the Ranged skill and see enemy weak points in Tactical Time Dilation, The Outer Worlds\u2019 version of Fallout\u2019s V.A.T.S. I understood little of this in the first few hours, and this left me feeling like combat was simply there out of necessity.Once I had a feel for combat and how the skill and perk trees worked, things opened up. I started thinking outside the box about how to approach objectives. There is almost always more than one way to tackle a quest in The Outer Worlds. Players can choose to invest heavily in the Persuade skill to talk their way out of a sticky situation, go with a balance of combat and people skills, or shoot their way through any problems that pop up. I regret a lot of my skill-point decisions from my first run, mostly because the game teased me by showing I could have talked my way out of something had I spent my skill points better. Say hello to replay value.The Outer Worlds is not just about shooting and conflict, though. Most of my time was spent exploring, digging into the lore presented through environmental storytelling, and working my way through conversations that would shape the future of the colony. I\u2019m not someone who can leave a building or crate unchecked. I must read all terminals, pick up all gear, and look high and low for alternate paths to complete an objective or find a hidden stash of weapons. The Outer Worlds has an abundance of subtle things to discover.The high of exploration is driven by gorgeous graphics in The Outer Worlds. Realism isn\u2019t the goal, with Obsidian Entertainment opting instead to go with a colorful world full of unique characters and creatures.

Each has their own story and gameplay benefits when in the player\u2019s company. I had my favorites shortly after meeting them, and generally stuck with those two (yes, you can travel with two at a time) unless there was a gameplay reason for taking someone else, such as their personal quest.In hindsight, The Outer Worlds might have my favorite companions in any game, partly because of how relatable I found them, but also because they offered real value to my decisions. At one point I was settled on a major choice, until my companion offered up an alternate perspective I hadn\u2019t considered. I\u2019m used to NPCs telling me something is bad because they believe it\u2019s bad, but this was more subtle and genuinely convinced me I was making the wrong move when I previously thought it was a no-brainer.If there\u2019s anything that just wasn\u2019t quite up to standard with The Outer Worlds, it was in its menus. The pop-up description for inventory items blocks the rest of the inventory, which made navigation a bit of a chore. The Codex, for some reason, would give me a notification if I repeated an in-game action I\u2019d already been notified of. The quest log would only allow tracking a single quest, even with several to tackle while in the area. This led me to track a quest, check the map, track another, check the map, and repeat this through my entire quest page.For the most part, I was a fan of the game\u2019s workbench where players can tinker, modify, scrap, or repair their weapons and armor. What I wasn\u2019t a fan of was finding a weapon in the world and not being able to compare it to what I had equipped. Carry weight is limited based on skills, perks, mods and companions, so I might pick a weapon up or leave it behind based on stats, but this decision required entering and exiting several menus. I also would have preferred my personal storage on the Unreliable be connected to the workbench for easier modifications to gear. None of these were game breaking and it would only cause me momentary frustration, but it\u2019s something that could have been better polished.It took me a few hours to really get my feet under me in The Outer Worlds. During those early stages, I thought this was a good game most would enjoy, but I wasn\u2019t thinking about it between sessions and questioning decisions. It was an issue of mastery, though, and it would be unrealistic to expect the best a game has to offer in the first 10 percent of its content. As I began to invest more, I found a highly rewarding experience. When I reached the conclusion of my first run, I couldn\u2019t wait to get back in and right some wrongs by approaching things from a different perspective.The Outer Worlds demands players put in the time and effort if they want the best it has to offer. It\u2019s a fine game under any circumstances, but it\u2019s a top-notch RPG with heavy consequences at almost every turn for those that are willing to immerse themselves. The Outer Worlds doesn\u2019t tell you a story, it gives you a world full of interesting characters and asks you to tell your own.This review is based on a PC download code provided by the publisher.

The Outer Worlds may reach across planets, but it's smaller in scale that Fallout 4 and New Vegas. It's a focused game with a joyously conceived world, society and politics, making exploration and conversation with the locals flow like swirling currents. You're unlikely to get lost or lose track of your objectives when such snappy dialogue tumbles out of mouths. There's always a zinging one-liner to give you a sign-posted push in the right direction. Who doesn't want to flirt with a pharmacist for free drugs? Why would you say no to a mission that asks you to retrieve dinosaur robot porn?\n\nAlthough you're exploring multiple planets and space stations, it's as familiar as the Wasteland or Commonwealth. The Outer Worlds is draped in sci-fi Americana, with a little bit of the Wild West thrown in for good measure. It has its own version of VATS where you slow down time to pinpoint better shots and cause more damage. It has a wealth of perks to choose from, sassy companions who need your help, and romantic dilemmas to get involved with. You will hack, loot, upgrade at benches and sneak past guards who really should be able to spot a party of three knee-crouching like something out of a bad panto. There's even a cute mascot or two to rival Vault Boy. An early part of the main questline has you wrestle with a big moral decision like you're back in Nuketown playing with The Power of the Atom. Todd Howard must be doing his nut in.Still, while it borrows heavily from Bethesda to the point of someone from the legal department drafting a stern letter, it's also confident in its own strengths. The clear highlight of The Outer Worlds is its dialogue and characters. The locals are quick witted, or drunk and stupid, horny, aggressive, depressed, pissed off, cynical, caustic, hyped up, ignorant, condescending and angry.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae707ea4-f7bd-4116-b371-d1820fe6c06a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae707ea4-f7bd-4116-b371-d1820fe6c06a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ed66462-dba7-419a-bbe3-35e880d59c91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c94ce94be965db9b253a49a23faa7cc409dc71322fdba893a14dc1d024273e20"}, "3": {"node_id": "a9c7fe16-aca8-4af1-b3b9-afb2fefba666", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "483675e1fa340022f3d3d687285a0dcbf99441c3eed2bd286f100dc69f415e4e"}}, "hash": "fe745a4c6b6f2a011eaed5e3bba257cb40b151c74b48b4023f86d42a3dc1f444", "text": "They're a hoot, and it feels like every branch of conversation spins off into its own drama, tale of revenge, loss or friendship. It's refreshing and noticeable that the world isn't populated by boring white men asking you to do gruff military stuff. One of the first romance options you come across isn't about your personal love interests, but trying to facilitate a get together between two characters admiring each other from afar. It's genuinely sweet, even for a cynical, old, black-hearted bastard like myself. There's a lot more fun to be had spending quality time with the locals than fighting the mercenaries and monsters that lurk outside of town.  \n \n\"For those that were disappointed with Fallout 76 going online multiplayer, this is the single-player RPG you've been looking for\"That's not to say combat is bad, but it is flavourless. The Outer Worlds is a better RPG and adventure game than a shooter, so it's a shame that it litters unexplored areas with so many enemies. It can feel like a slog churning through them to get to the next interesting populace. Enemy AI tends to default between charging like a bloke on a Saturday after nine pints, or just floating in the distance spitting venom and bullets at you. Your best approach is either send in your companions to do the dirty work, unload everything you have, or run away. There's also an abundance of cash and ammo on the default settings, which may be an admission that you'll want to blast through combat to get to the better bits. If violence and risk is your thing, tougher difficulties will make your companions mortal. But again, I'd rather try a second playthrough with a different attitude and stats than simply making combat harder.And while it borrows from the best, it doesn't stretch itself or risk innovation. The Outer Worlds never goes too deep in any one direction. Sure, you can upgrade and tinker with your stats, but you'll never get lost in the system or fall down a rabbit hole to really refine your character build. There's a neat little flaw system in play that adapts to your style; if you get your ass kicked by a lot of robots, for example, you can choose to accept a phobia and weakened stats in exchange for an extra perk. It's a shame then that perks are so functional. They may help you carry more, or do more damage, but there's little of the inventiveness of Fallout's vampire Hematophage perk, or the Mysterious Stranger. That feels like a missed opportunity in a game brimming with wit, but maybe it's something that would develop for a sequel. It also commits a few basic RPG sins we thought were on their way to the bin in 2019, such as forcing you to choose stats before you've barely played the game. But when it's hitting you with good gags at character creation with all the perky confidence of a Barden Bella on enrollment day, it's a niggle you can forgive quite easily.  \n \nIt doesn't feel right to praise a game for not having ugly or game-breaking bugs, but it's something we associate with this genre of sprawling single-player RPG. In The Outer Worlds' case then, Bethesda should really take note. Aside from some basic pop-up entering larger areas, I've come across no evidence of weird graphical glitches, busted questlines, disappearing items, weird animations or any of the other sloppiness we've become used to in recent Fallout games. Congratulations on not being broken, The Outer Worlds. That said, this is a much less physical world than Bethesda\u2019s, which are usually littered with props that the game has to remember the location of. Most of The Outer Worlds\u2019 items exist in menus.  I usually play these games with a build that errs on the side of violence when it comes down to it. I'm happy to play with a nasty attitude and blunder through killing and insulting people if I think there's more in it for me. But The Outer Worlds had me considering my violent acts, pulling me back from the brink on a number of occasions when I thought I'd already made my mind up how to deal with a situation. That's a testament to the great writing and characterisation, and it's this that The Outer Worlds should be celebrated for above all else.The Outer Worlds serves a need and fills a gap very neatly at the end of this console generation. The charm of The Outer Worlds lends itself to water-cooler tales and other moments to share, and certainly more than one playthrough adopting alternative styles. It's safe, but very welcoming. I can even see it developing into sequels if Microsoft chooses to support it and the fans embrace it, which I have no doubt will happen - some games are just made to cosplay.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9c7fe16-aca8-4af1-b3b9-afb2fefba666": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9c7fe16-aca8-4af1-b3b9-afb2fefba666", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5415f1d4-b126-499b-9f92-cb1ac0f76d15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0bfb1b76d708aaefb5e70fc04e438bbc69914250be8db17ba002feb64fec8864"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae707ea4-f7bd-4116-b371-d1820fe6c06a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe745a4c6b6f2a011eaed5e3bba257cb40b151c74b48b4023f86d42a3dc1f444"}}, "hash": "483675e1fa340022f3d3d687285a0dcbf99441c3eed2bd286f100dc69f415e4e", "text": "For those that were disappointed with Fallout 76 going online multiplayer, this is the single-player RPG you've been looking for.
