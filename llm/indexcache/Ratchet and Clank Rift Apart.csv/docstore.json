Released for the PlayStation 5 in 2021, it takes a beloved duo of Sony mascots and sends them on a journey designed to show off the specific capabilities of that hardware\u2014particularly its fast-loading SSD, showcased with a story all about hopping seamlessly between different universes. All of which makes it a bit of an oddity to be reviewing on PC in 2023. \u00a0Let's start with the simple stuff. Even if you have no familiarity with the Ratchet & Clank series\u2014which, if you're a dedicated PC player, you almost certainly don't\u2014Rift Apart is an accessible introduction. Set in a bright and cartoony sci-fi galaxy, the game follows Ratchet, a furry alien space hero, and his robot sidekick Clank, as they attempt to solve an interdimensional crisis set off by one of their old foes. Though there's a weight of history here, with tons of references for long-time fans and the pair almost playing the role of retired veterans after their many adventures across the series' 20 years of games, it's all easy enough to understand. Clank wants to help Ratchet find his lost people, Ratchet is trepidatious about it, they both want to save the universe\u2014simple.\u00a0Said interdimensional crisis provides sufficient excuse for yet another multiverse-hopping story\u2014and for the introduction of Rivet and Kit. These two are essentially female versions of the leads, but fully-realised and compelling in their own right, and as totally new heroes provide an even easier lead into the game for newcomers. As you progress through the story, you alternate between playing Ratchet and Rivet, who share all the same abilities and equipment, but have very different outlooks on the world.\u00a0The action is pure cinematic adventure. Between regular bouts of third-person shooting and light platforming, you're thrown into extravagant set-pieces, lavish boss fights, and lovingly-crafted cutscenes, with a little exploration and puzzle-solving for spice. Rarely is it taxing, but it isn't dull, never letting any of its ideas outwear their welcome over the course of its breezy 10-15 hour runtime.For a PS5 player in 2021, it was an easy recommendation\u2014with its slick, big budget visuals and buttery smooth performance, it was a solid, if frothy, exclusive, a theme park ride to show off what Sony's hardware could do. On PC in 2023? Well\u2026 my feelings are a little more complicated.The game runs at a smooth 60+ FPS at max settings, wavering to around 45 only in a few particularly dense areas. Let's address the elephant in the room: Sony's interest in PC seems to have been growing in recent years, with a string of high profile ports of its back catalogue, but it hasn't all been smooth going. Most recently, The Last of Us' PC port was so poor we had to give one of the most acclaimed console games of all time a 50% review score. The good news is, Rift Apart is not a repeat of that disaster.With my RTX 3080 graphics card and AMD Ryzen 9 5900X processor, the game mostly runs at a smooth 60+ FPS at max settings, wavering down to around 45 only in a few particularly dense areas. Sequences in which you hop rapidly between dimensions\u2014originally intended to show off how much faster the PS5's SSD is than the PS4's hard drive\u2014have had a few noticeable loading pauses for me, but nothing long enough to diminish the spectacle. Indeed, the game has very little noticeable loading time throughout, despite the speed with which you can travel between different levels and planets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f4b98dc-470f-4a2e-a998-66dc83ef0ac7": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f4b98dc-470f-4a2e-a998-66dc83ef0ac7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "077bef23-870d-41ac-af74-73a7602b55e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "342ded01cafa7cf15a5ebb2fda77ee51584eb1039b6d27efcdb58515961a9f63"}, "3": {"node_id": "93771046-2675-47ea-9c16-047a8a6c45a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8fb93714c4647ae890408625f8f796793d219b1516769402f13c93d22faa60c"}}, "hash": "09c0bc63cd1f8f298e1f595aa32d939e832c39c15b9366001b8f68581266a448", "text": "Particularly impressive is that even when I switched my installation over from my SSD to a hard drive, I noticed very little difference in loading and performance.There's a full range of graphics and display settings to tweak to your liking, including an FOV slider, adjustable weather effects, and you can even choose how the game performs its upscaling. A wealth of control options let you adjust the feel of the game's action, and there are specific settings for speed-runners that allow you to remove certain pauses and slow-mo elements to shave precious seconds off your time. It's a robust and fully-featured port, the kind you'd hope to see from one of the biggest game publishers in the world.And though it doesn't run quite as smoothly as it did on PS5, Rift Apart remains a lovely way to push your hardware. Visual spectacle is the game's greatest strength, combining technical wizardry with a gorgeously exuberant art-style to create scenes and vistas that are no less impressive for being two years old. Particle effects abound, backgrounds are always dense with activity, dimensional portals send you hurtling from a cyberpunk city to a storm-lashed pirate ship in seconds, and cutscenes feel the equal of many blockbuster animated movies.It excels at both the big and small details. Enormous robots and towering dinosaurs crash into scenes as a matter of course, but at the same time a wonderful amount of care is given to the subtle movements and facial expressions of its characters. Though the story hardly plumbs complex emotional depths, you'll certainly find yourself empathising with the central cast a lot more than you ever expected to with a furry-faced alien or a robot the size of a lunchbox.\u00a0The sheer creativity and visual flair of each weapon ensures combat never grows stale. Every combat encounter is glorious visual chaos. The basic shooting is very straightforward\u2014there's no cover, and the aiming is very generous, so you're free to just run around blasting without much need for tactical thinking. What adds colour is a huge arsenal of wild and wacky weapons. Even your most basic options include a shotgun as big as Ratchet that fires double-blasts of coruscating electricity, and a grenade that explodes into pink crystal shards that\u2026 also explode. Things only get more wonderfully surreal from there, including a gun that fires rocket drills that burrow under enemies, a sprinkler that turns enemies into topiary, and a summonable mushroom man who aids you in battle.\u00a0Though none elevate the strategy much beyond pointing at enemies and clicking, the sheer creativity and visual flair of each weapon ensures combat never grows stale\u2014particularly because you can always bring all of them into battle, your weapon wheel simply gaining more and more tabs to flick between as you fill them up. Each gun also levels up as you use it, unlocking new nodes on an upgrade tree that can be filled out with the game's primary collectible, Raritanium. Though many of these feel a bit restrained considering the goofiness of the guns\u2014it's disappointing, for example, that the first major milestone for a weapon that literally blasts enemies into pixelated versions of themselves is just that they're a bit more likely to drop health when they die\u2014enough investment in your favourite guns does make a noticeable impact in combat.\u00a0You're almost as well-equipped for the game's platforming and exploration. Starting off with a double-jump, grappling hook, and magnet boots, in short order you gain a generous air dash, wall-running, rocket boots that let you blast around at top speed, and more. They're all put to good use in various escapes and chase scenes over the course of the story, inevitably with things exploding and dimensions tearing open all around you as you go. But they come into their own when you take a break from your quest to go hunting for side content.Each of the game's planets is its own little hub. Some are modest\u2014barely more than whatever area you went through as part of the story\u2014while others are like mini open worlds, that you're free to explore (or, in one case, fly around on the back of an alien dragon). Several have major sidequests to go back and complete, realised with just as much cinematic craft as the main story. And all of them are stuffed with collectibles to uncover, from Raritanium to new outfits to \"golden bolts\" that let you do everything from reskinning your melee weapon to changing what currency looks like to applying different camera filters.Rift Apart is a console showcase that feels far less vital on PC. Working your way through everything Rift Apart has to offer is a gentle but satisfying experience. No enemy is that hard to beat, no collectible is that convoluted to find, and there's plenty of mechanical and visual variety to prevent you getting bored.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93771046-2675-47ea-9c16-047a8a6c45a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "93771046-2675-47ea-9c16-047a8a6c45a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f4b98dc-470f-4a2e-a998-66dc83ef0ac7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "09c0bc63cd1f8f298e1f595aa32d939e832c39c15b9366001b8f68581266a448"}, "3": {"node_id": "02e68332-786b-43c9-9960-12808fb8effe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3bb513e3a11ed8cbaa584142da3b6b0a96cc5af8319ebf3eea82d3d75540273"}}, "hash": "f8fb93714c4647ae890408625f8f796793d219b1516769402f13c93d22faa60c", "text": "As a weekend of cinematic adventure and pleasant ticking off of tasks, it's really endearing.The problem is that even collecting absolutely everything, doing every sidequest, and fully upgrading every gun in addition to completing the main story only took me about 15 hours total. If you just mainline the critical path, it'll be 10 hours or less. There is a new game+ mode, with further levels of weapon upgrades to gain, but while I enjoyed my time with Rift Apart, there certainly isn't enough depth to compel me to immediately replay it.Brevity is no bad thing in games, but it's hard to escape the sense that Rift Apart is a console showcase that feels far less vital on PC.

That thing is crunchy action, springy movement, a kind of intangible elasticity of motion. It's playfulness. The team's boiled it down to a formula now - formulas can be good things too by the way - and so they can now inject it with precision into everything they make, from Sunset Overdrive to Spider-Man to of course Ratchet and Clank.Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is the latest and it's a treat; featherlight and welcoming, almost completely on rails - sometimes literally - but in a way that just makes playing it a breeze. Mild peril, low to no stakes, a kind and thoughtful heart, a fairly large amount of Nickelodeon jokes that might've washed over me but will no doubt split the sides of your seven-year-old. A blast. This is what Insomniac does so very well: makes games full of charm, movement full of whip and snap, animation full of life.Here's the setup: Ratchet is a furry creature called a Lombax, lonely and one-ish of a kind, his sidekick Clank is a little robot, and the two of you are heroes. As a gift, on an opening day that has the two of you float through your own victory parade, Clank has made Ratchet a Dimensionator, an old macguffin that can open up portals to different dimensions. But - surprise! - things go sour when the nominatively-determined Dr. Nefarious turns up and pilfers it, travelling to a dimension where he always wins. And we're off.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02e68332-786b-43c9-9960-12808fb8effe": {"__data__": {"id_": "02e68332-786b-43c9-9960-12808fb8effe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "93771046-2675-47ea-9c16-047a8a6c45a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8fb93714c4647ae890408625f8f796793d219b1516769402f13c93d22faa60c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e9dd6c1-6b48-456f-8acc-4e59d274b248", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "66b391cafadf612d3df6285b27e3294715f8e2453189a9517e81d1af018046f0"}}, "hash": "f3bb513e3a11ed8cbaa584142da3b6b0a96cc5af8319ebf3eea82d3d75540273", "text": "And we're off. The rest of the plot's a little thin (lots of that payoff can-kicking, \"At last, we finally have everything we need to buil- Oh no! The machine's broken!\" kind of thing, which can make events feel a touch more overlong than they actually are) but the plot is very much not the point.What is the point is the Insomniac delivery, the story, which is a simple, mushy delight. In one alternate dimension is another Lombax, called Rivet, and another little robot sidekick, called Kit, and without knowing it the two share a sweet, redemptive arc that's built on forgiveness and growth. Ratchet and Clank are separated early on, and it makes for a tidy switcheroo: Clank loses an arm and must come to terms with it, pairing up with the empowered Rivet, who uses a prosthetic arm of her own and for the most part already has. Some ever-so-slightly mechanical therapy speak will go over the heads of younger players, but the point is it's a good story, a kind one, and so one you'll want those kids to listen to, whether they follow all the nuances or not.Rivet herself is ace, playing more or less identically to Ratchet - she is an alternate universe him, after all - but she's a smidge more likeable. She's wittier and brighter, reliably dropping a cutting \"huh?\" face whenever Nefarious waffles. There is also a whiff of Marvel Cinematic Universe about the whole thing, too, what with the alt-dimension versions of other familiar faces that pop up here and there, and how Rivet gets her 'origin story' delivered through another's journey, very deliberately laying the foundations for a standalone one of her own (surely). Rift Apart has some great accessibility options which deserve to be highlighted. They're split into four sections in the menu: Gameplay and Camera, Toggles and Assists, Visual and Contrast options and Shortcuts and Game Speed. Things like \"simplified traversal\" can help by mapping all traversal methods (grapples, dashes, etc.) onto the circle button, while high-contrast backgrounds and visual shaders for heroes, allies and enemies are smart inclusions. The controller layout's also fully customisable, with both \"left/right bias\" presets as well as two fully open custom slots. In brief: great stuff!Planets are split evenly between the two heroes, and hopping between them is arguably the core of Rift Apart. Each one's structured like a PS2 era gem: miniature open worlds sprinkled with collectibles and resources. Most important is Raritanium, which goes towards upgrading your weapons, and works as a perfect, incentivising carrot to drag you into exploration. There are some optional side quests on some - meeting some oddly-voiced character or other to collect X plants or Y ingredients - but the reality is it's all incredibly simple, even shallow, but the charm of it and the sheer amount of money-on-screen fidelity makes the simplicity a strength. Each of these planets builds to an Uncharted-like, action-platforming climax: the sequence with The Fixer, a literal on-rails rollercoaster, feels like the best Disney World ride you've ever been on; another, about avoiding a roaming monster in an abandoned underwater facility, is all very Alien Isolation (a great primer for the kids - or fellow cowards). Again they're simple, breezy, largely linear and handled with the lightest touch but again that's the joy of it. One thing that surprised me, a little, was the warping between worlds, which is a bit different to what you might've seen in trailers. The big, between-multiple-dimensions moments, where the hero's falling through the sky and the environment rapidly flicks from one to the next, only come in cutscenes. Most portals that you use in practise are actually like an instant grapple, a short-hop teleportation, basically, where you tap L1 at a pre-fixed portal and instantly pop out the other side.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e9dd6c1-6b48-456f-8acc-4e59d274b248": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e9dd6c1-6b48-456f-8acc-4e59d274b248", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "02e68332-786b-43c9-9960-12808fb8effe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3bb513e3a11ed8cbaa584142da3b6b0a96cc5af8319ebf3eea82d3d75540273"}, "3": {"node_id": "d25a9bf2-16fb-4442-8148-670e87d05cc7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "400e5d77525a4d1842e3cd8d3e7b51c4b2c6dc9586afd03de1db234d769bf6f9"}}, "hash": "66b391cafadf612d3df6285b27e3294715f8e2453189a9517e81d1af018046f0", "text": "It is slightly, slightly, less impressive than repeatedly teleporting through entire worlds, but there's still a wonderful zip to it, a sense of whiplash to how the whole world zooms forwards over you like you just concertinaed space-time onto itself, the pencil-through-folded-paper approach of an actual wormhole.There are a couple of exceptions to this very minor limitation, too, in \"pocket dimensions\", which are little bonus round zones you find tucked behind semi-hidden portals, and much more impressively in planets like Blizar, which have stationary crystals that you whack to instantly switch the environment to an alt-dimension version of the planet. This is where your traversal, which is often a minor puzzle, becomes just a bit more of a headscratcher at times - move this here, whack that crystal, jump back here, crystal again, and so on. At once Blizar is a purple, fractured void in space, chunks of planet floating about without atmosphere like it's had a good zap from the Death Star, and at the same time, instantly, it's a bustling, volcanic mining world full of people. Rift Apart's effectively giving you two worlds at once, but it's so casual about it all that it's easy to overlook. This really is a marvel, though, and makes for some of the best sections in the game.The others, of course, revolve around the many moments of action. The exploration and the resource-hoovering is a sort of nostalgic by-product in Rift Apart, a passive activity you can do brain half-off, scooting about with one of the game's million different modes of travel. The action, meanwhile, is brain-full-on stuff. It's carnage, Insomniac doing that new console generation thing of throwing an obscene amount of objects, particles, pizzazz on the screen at once. Enemies, however mechanical the robot-pirates or nefarious drones may be, seem to burst like summer fruit before fading away vaporised. It makes combat feel like a celebration, a birthday party, as the little orange-domed heads pop or dino-skeleton bones explode apart like confetti, all amongst the most aggressive vividity of colour - purple rifts, electric blue skies, red lava, golden-brown stone.It's paced beautifully, with what might be a teasing difficulty for youngsters - I played on normal and found it a breeze, especially after the villainous but oddly similar-in-kind Returnal (bullet-hell, jump-dashes, grappling hooks, disintegrating lasers, little shiny things that burst out of enemies and need collecting, big and oddly static bosses lurking just the other side of a ledge - I digress!), but there are moments, especially against bosses, where you'll run very tight on ammo even with a solid aim, and good movement and concentration will become more important. For adults it's exactly what you'll want, enough to suck you into a zen trance without ever forcing you to sit forwards in your chair. The weapons themselves, as you'd expect, are a highlight amongst the highs. My favourites were the Topiary Sprinkler, which squirts water at nearby enemies and turns them into decoratively trimmed hedges, frozen in place; and Mr. Fungi, which is a mushroom that darts about annoying enemies like the floating pun that he is. Award for most effective goes to the shotgun, which has a wonderful half-pull trigger system where you can fire just one or both of the two barrels depending on how hard you squeeze. Least enjoyable is the ice cube one, which felt a bit redundant next to the funnier Topiary Sprinkler that served the same purpose, and the Headhunter, a fairly run-of-the-mill sharpshooter which, in what is at least partially a children's game, all felt a bit NRA-sponsored Nerf-gun to me - Baby's First Sniper Rifle - but then Fortnite and others normalised this a while ago, so maybe dad should get with the times. What matters most is they're fun.All of this is paired with wonderful, kinetic motion. Ratchet and Rivet have a warehouse full of toys when it comes to movement - a result, maybe, of first-party Sony games' slightly magpie-like approach to mechanics (wall-running, for instance, barely feels necessary here, and see also the ubiquitous grappling hooks now, replacing the once-ubiquitous golden ledges). Jumping is a tad wafty, I found, making a very small number of platforming moments feel a touch fiddly or imprecise.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d25a9bf2-16fb-4442-8148-670e87d05cc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d25a9bf2-16fb-4442-8148-670e87d05cc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e9dd6c1-6b48-456f-8acc-4e59d274b248", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "66b391cafadf612d3df6285b27e3294715f8e2453189a9517e81d1af018046f0"}, "3": {"node_id": "73c85dd0-c5e0-432e-9974-c8f8c9161acb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d3482d72e6f4ab3686d07cc141d60b11c335fffdbbbf9fa512f716032d2b7bb5"}}, "hash": "400e5d77525a4d1842e3cd8d3e7b51c4b2c6dc9586afd03de1db234d769bf6f9", "text": "The dash, similarly, is a wibbly-wobbly thing that seems to happen almost in slow motion, which feels slightly out of step with the frantic energy of combat and everything else, but yet again what works is the characterisation of it all, the life imbued into it by Insomniac - the wobbles of ears and tails, the cartwheels in the air, the handful of rapid spins you do round a yellow grappling thingy before you're fully launched, the warp speed of the rails, hover boots and mounts.The exploration and the resource-hoovering is a sort of nostalgic by-product in Rift Apart, a passive activity you can do brain half-off... The action, meanwhile, is brain-full-on stuff.A couple of other modes punctuate the action, minigames that are maybe the tiniest bit underworked on their own, but work as very welcome pauses to the usual carnage. One has Clank solving environmental puzzles in a metaphorical version of his own mind, where you must redirect your \"possibilities\" (little ghost Clanks that are effectively a stream of Lemmings) through various hazards. It's an odd but actually quite lovably laboured metaphor, working your thoughts through all logical paths until you find the right one, the answer to a problem, but the actual sequences themselves are just fine, tasking you with fetching balls and plonking them in certain slots to catapult your possible Lemmings over this chasm or that buzzsaw. A bit more fun, if stressful, are the \"anti-virus\" sections, where you play a shrill and deeply nervous crab-robot armed with the most satisfying machine gun of the game, climbing walls, going topsy-turvy around the little computer-chip world all while shooting literal virus-shaped blobs and overcoming imposter syndrome with great triumph. Sheesh!This is it though, the character and the absurdity and the charm that Insomniac is all about, that the team kick-started with Ratchet and Clank in 2002 and continue to master with such faultless confidence in Rift Apart. It's just pure craft, pure fun, pure video games - all the brilliant, bizarre ideas this studio has just thrown at the wall and all of them sticking. The only thing it lacks - apart from maybe a tiny bit of restraint - is pretence. There's no self-seriousness, no po-faced melodrama, no insecurity about the form. A game that's happy to be a game, in a familiar, cuddly shape.\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nChris Tapsell\n\n          Deputy Editor\n        Chris Tapsell is Eurogamer's Deputy Editor and most decorated Football Manager.

It's one cardiac event of excitement after another, riding rails at reckless speeds, taking on huge hordes of nefarious forces with increasingly ridiculous weapons, and flying through dimensional tears with the Rift Tether. When you do stop for a breath to buy a new gun or hunt around for a collectible, you'll get to appreciate just how damn pretty it is too, Ratchet has never looked fuzzier, and Clank has never been shinier.\u00a0Release date: June 11, 2021\nPlatform(s): PS5\nDeveloper: Insomniac Games\nPublisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentThis time around, the dynamic duo has a big problem.

Rifts have opened up to alternate dimensions, the plucky pair have been separated, and the Dimensionator has been destroyed. It's a perfect setup for some interdimensional madness, and a clever way to introduce Rivet, Ratchet's counterpart in a version of their world ruled by a much more successful Nefarious. And yes, this will involve big guns that do silly stuff.\u00a0Swapping between Ratchet and Rivet as the story dictates, you'll travel between different planets to try and find a way to build a new Dimensionator and stop the collapse of, well, everything.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ee2b1fe-de1b-4644-bb82-8e019a954f7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ee2b1fe-de1b-4644-bb82-8e019a954f7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "73c85dd0-c5e0-432e-9974-c8f8c9161acb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d3482d72e6f4ab3686d07cc141d60b11c335fffdbbbf9fa512f716032d2b7bb5"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ad13d00-8642-4a05-9504-5770e05871f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "450afbd7c9043dba3c03ade004c5e7426791f03da91c09219e969c82db3d8d4d"}}, "hash": "e8f97a0a3e510511fd59babe8c948b202b4c8619dfa93a036c6e1d60c6bafa9b", "text": "There's a main questline to follow, optional side quests (which you'll do because somehow Insomniac Games has managed to make them all a bloody delight), and the usual collecting of raritanium for upgrading weapons, and golden bolts for unlocking extras like visual filters. This time around there's also pocket dimensions, little puzzle boxes of platforming where, if you can get to the end, you'll be rewarded with a new piece of armor for Ratchet or Rivet, and Lemmings style logic problems Clank will need to solve, directing tiny versions of himself through obstacle courses. Use a little robot buddy called Glitch to fix broken computers, and you'll be transported into a miniature where you'll blast viruses and bring down firewalls. Honestly, there's so much packed into this game it's like some sort of crazy game mechanics pinata.The variety extends to the main game too. Each planet has a distinct feel and environment, and the game will throw some new way to explore it at every turn. You might be flying on the back of a dinosaur-esque mount, or using rocket boots and your tether to race across ancient mountain paths before they collapse. A personal favorite moment was creeping through a dark space station, chased by something angry and unpleasant, and using dimensional jumps to get through safely.\u00a0I only encountered two real issues in my exploration, one side quest where some enemies that needed to be cleared had gone stuck at the edge of a lava pool, and another where a nightmare to seek out and destroy, and another where an enemy got stuck behind a closed door. I could hear them, but I couldn't get to them to take them out and move the story on. There was some swearing and a few checkpoint restarts before I managed to blast the particularly dumb enemy to bits before the door shuts. Other valiant members of the GamesRadar team experienced a number of game crashes in their playthroughs, but reported that the game's constant checkpointing and speedy loading times means it was more of an inconvenience than a massive drama. There's a good chance these were the pre-patch bugs of a game that was still getting a final lick of polish, but if you get stuck helping a chef at any point, for the love of god check the lava pits.Of course, the series has always been famous for its guns, and while I'll always miss the Groovitron disco gun from Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, the new Topiary Sprinkler glove is a close second. It shoots sprinklers that transform any enemy into a beautiful garden hedge, complete with blooms and falling leaves as you smash at them with your wrench. There's just something so satisfying about turning a giant, malevolent spaceship into something that would look good on Grandma's lawn. It's not all just for show though, the more you play the more you realize there's a strategy to upgrading and swapping between weapons, picking the right tool for the right carnage. We're not talking Counter-Strike levels of tactical awareness, you can do pretty well just blasting, but you can't help but get a feel for certain guns, and learn to use them to avoid an inconveniently timed death. The ability to use your tether on dimensional rifts in the battlefield add a little something too, giving you a quick way to get behind enemies, dodge mega attacks, and reach platforms at the speed of a button press.\u00a0A pat on the back to the gameplay team at Insomniac Games too for not making it a slog to unlock all the weapons. I love a shiny bolt, and smashed every crate I saw, but was able to kit Rivet and Ratchet out (the characters share an inventory so you don't have to play favorites) without having to take a break from the thrust of the story to go on grindy bolt-hunting missions. I did the side quests, raced through the main missions, and was able to finish the game with everything unlocked. Nothing's meaner than a game that wants to keep the best toys away from you.\u00a0Even with the high-speed pace, the game always looks pristine. I'm even going to lean on the old cliche \"like a Pixar movie\" because the characters and world deserve it. The series has always been a marker for what PlayStation exclusives can do with the power of a new console, and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is upholding that tradition. Characters are colorful and expressive, the world is layered with textures and detailed whatever planet you're on, and I often found myself stumbling on a collectible just because I was wandering around wanting to take in more of the scenery. The game is also the perfect showcase for the DualSense's adaptive triggers, giving you nuanced feedback for guns and actions that send signals to your brain you don't even realize you're getting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ad13d00-8642-4a05-9504-5770e05871f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ad13d00-8642-4a05-9504-5770e05871f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ee2b1fe-de1b-4644-bb82-8e019a954f7f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8f97a0a3e510511fd59babe8c948b202b4c8619dfa93a036c6e1d60c6bafa9b"}, "3": {"node_id": "a78ad791-ec42-441c-80f3-302d10a646f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b6c72203c5679a6a3ed9057886efae7c591973d4913f0216e1aa33859838a43"}}, "hash": "450afbd7c9043dba3c03ade004c5e7426791f03da91c09219e969c82db3d8d4d", "text": "You'll fire a shot, feel resistance under your trigger finger, and know that if you keep pushing you'll get a bigger blast. I'm still a massive fan of the potential of PS5's haptic feedback, and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart makes a great exhibit A in my campaign to convince the world.As well as the looks and the fancy tech, it feels like the story-telling of the series has really evolved with Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. Don't get me wrong, I've always liked the lombax and his shiny sidekick, but it's never been a series I've engaged with emotionally beyond a yearning for the next unlockable weapon. This time around I was all in, especially when it came to the story of the depressed robot companion Kit. With her sunny yellow body and dour mood, she's an icon for our times, and I wanted a happy ending for her so badly it gave me low-level anxiety. It feels as though Insomniac's writers have taken their cues from more recent Marvel movies, managing the tricky balancing act of cartoon mayhem and emotional payoffs. It made me, a casual lombax fancier, more invested in the series than ever before, and hoping we get to see a lot more of the fabulous foursome soon. \u00a0Reviewed on PS5 with a code provided by the publisher.Rachel Weber is the US Managing Editor of GamesRadar+ and lives in Brooklyn, New York.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, The most graphically impressive PS5 game so far is a stunning technical achievement but does the gameplay reach the same high standards?Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart has some of the most incredible visuals ever seen in a console game. Sony wanted to show off the power of the PlayStation 5 and they have done exactly that, not just in terms of the graphics but the speed and versatility of the superfast SSD (solid-state drive). It\u2019s an incredible technical feat, especially as it seems it was originally planned to be a launch title, but it\u2019s telling just how quickly you become accustomed to the incredible visuals and realise that the game underneath isn\u2019t quite so impressive.The Ratchet & Clank franchise will be celebrating its 20th anniversary next year, with this being the ninth mainline entry. It\u2019s a curious franchise in that it shows all the hallmarks of success, including its own animated movie, and yet the games rarely appear on any best of lists and its characters never evolved into the format mascots it seems they could have become. However, representing the power of the PlayStation 5 is arguably the highest profile they\u2019ve ever been and certain to earn them a curious new audience.Spider-Man developer Insomniac has been responsible for almost all the games, bar some of the spin-offs, and while they do have some light platforming and puzzling elements they\u2019re primarily third person shooters. Ratchet is a pointy-eared Lombax, who does most of the shooting, while Clank is his robot pal who handles the puzzles and exposition. It\u2019s a very simple set-up but made more interesting by the huge range of increasingly preposterous weapons.Although the whole game looks amazing the opening half hour is going to sell so many PlayStation 5s it\u2019s not even funny.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a78ad791-ec42-441c-80f3-302d10a646f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a78ad791-ec42-441c-80f3-302d10a646f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "7ad13d00-8642-4a05-9504-5770e05871f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "450afbd7c9043dba3c03ade004c5e7426791f03da91c09219e969c82db3d8d4d"}, "3": {"node_id": "f0a6acff-cafd-4ede-aa53-a801b7e5adcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b02434fb0b5cfdbb8743a7e1f996ac1660353984bc1c57eb17124c7033c8b76"}}, "hash": "0b6c72203c5679a6a3ed9057886efae7c591973d4913f0216e1aa33859838a43", "text": "We never did see the animated movie, but we very much doubt it looks as good as this, as a victory parade is interrupted by alien mercenaries and leads to you jumping around on giant Ratchet and Clank shaped balloons, rail-grinding along the disintegrating interior of a float, and general open-mouthed astonishment at the sort of graphics that just a few years ago would have seemed impossible even when pre-rendered.And yet here they are, running in real-time and, depending on which graphics mode you choose, at dynamic 4K and 60 frames per second.There\u2019s a Mad Max style town sat atop a canyon, that you visit later on in the game, which looks so astoundingly good it\u2019s literally unbelievable. You can tell the level was designed with no enemies around at that point simply because Insomniac knew everyone would be staring in disbelief, and they\u2019re not wrong. This happens more times that you can count, from giant Blade Runner style cities to a number of open world areas that require animal mounts or jet-powered roller-skates to traverse conveniently.You can travel to different planets whenever you want, by returning to your ship, but wherever you are the gameplay is the same. The platforming, including a spot of wall running and judicious use of a grapple hook, is very straightforward and so is the action, with the dodge and dash moves rarely proving that necessary on the default difficult. (The game is very easy so we would advise starting off on at least the second highest of the available settings.)Where things get interesting is in the weapons themselves, which range from a simple pistol and shotgun analogue to increasingly bizarre devices, such as a sprinkler system that temporarily turns enemies into topiary to one that transforms them into a block of ice or shoots out a floating mushroom ally. Most of these are great fun, and there are almost two dozen of them, but none of them are any more or less effective against certain enemies \u2013 or at least not in any way that is easily noticeable.Apart from it being boring, or you running out of ammunition, there\u2019s no particular reason not to use the pistol for the entire game, as long as you keep upgrading it to be strong enough. Likewise, none of the enemies, not even the bosses, require any special techniques to defeat. They do have weakpoints, but again they\u2019re not very obvious and most work as simple Destiny style bullet sponges, where the only requirement is to aim roughly in the right direction and wait till their health bar runs down.Rift Apart is an intrinsically shallow game and we\u2019re not really sure why, other than that\u2019s what Insomniac and Sony seem to think constitutes a family friendly game. There are a number of other gameplay elements used to break up the action, including a Lemmings style puzzler for Clank (the only real puzzle element in the whole game, which notably can be skipped if you want), a fun little detour as a microscopic virus killer called Glitch, and some platform-based challenges inside pocket dimensions, but they\u2019re all equally superficial.Rather than the mute charm of a Nintendo game, Ratchet & Clank has a very talky script that is clearly meant to be funny for adults as well as children. It really isn\u2019t though and while Rift Apart may look like a Pixar movie it\u2019s certainly not written like one. There\u2019s some simple moral lessons mixed in with the plot, about a reality-destroying device stolen by semi-regular antagonist Doctor Nefarious, but it\u2019s very elementary and will struggle to interest anyone with an age in double digits.Potentially the most interesting wrinkle to the story is that the dimension-shifting brings Ratchet into contact with a female Lombax called Rivet. There\u2019s been a lot of speculation as to who or what Rivet is but while we won\u2019t spoil that here we will answer the question of what difference she makes to the gameplay: absolutely none. She\u2019s got a hammer instant of a wrench but other than that her abilities and weapons are identical to Clank\u2019s, including all the upgrades.You actually spend slightly more of the game playing as Rivet, but while she\u2019s an enjoyably sassy protagonist her presence barely makes any difference to the story, let alone anything else. The overriding impression of Rift Apart is that everything is there solely for surface appeal, with the impact on gameplay very much a secondary concern.Even the portals, which the marketing implies are one of the central tenets of the game, don\u2019t really make much impact, at least not on normal difficulty. The idea is that little orange portals can be grappled which instantly transports you across a few metres of space, allowing you to flank enemies that are otherwise hard to get at.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0a6acff-cafd-4ede-aa53-a801b7e5adcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0a6acff-cafd-4ede-aa53-a801b7e5adcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "a78ad791-ec42-441c-80f3-302d10a646f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b6c72203c5679a6a3ed9057886efae7c591973d4913f0216e1aa33859838a43"}, "3": {"node_id": "7879a800-825b-4c11-991a-6c483e076d56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fee2f367ed3a2b499c10d418ff70d57cb80522beafbc95e9a52f35d5c65139bf"}}, "hash": "2b02434fb0b5cfdbb8743a7e1f996ac1660353984bc1c57eb17124c7033c8b76", "text": "The problem is that many set pieces don\u2019t have any easily accessible portals and even if they do the mediocre artificial intelligence rarely needs much outfoxing.The portals are an impressive technical trick, as is instantly switching to entirely different worlds during the middle of a scene, but again it\u2019s never more than a visual gimmick. There\u2019s one section where you\u2019re switching between different versions of the same planet, before and after a natural disaster, but while this gives the impression it\u2019s building up to some clever light/dark world puzzling it\u2019s an almost entirely linear sequence that might as well be working on automatic for all the difference you make to it.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationAs far as we\u2019re concerned Spider-Man: Miles Morales is by far Insomniac\u2019s best work, as its shorter length not only improves the storytelling but also helps to hide the intrinsic shallowness of their games. Rift Apart certainly isn\u2019t very long but it feels like it\u2019s run out of ideas long before the end.There is some replayability, with a whole new tier of weapon upgrades to unlock on a subsequent playthrough, but Rift Apart struggles to justify the \u00a370 price tag. Although perhaps the most damning indictment is that regardless of the incredible graphics the basic design and gameplay still feels stuck in the PlayStation 2 era. The portals and open world areas don\u2019t make nearly enough difference and the third person gunplay, while competent, is still not as good as, say, Returnal.That\u2019s not to suggest that Rift Apart isn\u2019t entertaining, because it is, and not just in terms of wanting to see what the graphics are like on the next planet. But despite all the amazing visuals this is a surprisingly forgettable video game experience, with disappointingly low ambitions.In Short: The graphics are absolutely stunning but the gameplay is predictable and surprisingly uneventful, as the game fails to leverage its technical achievements for anything more than straightforward spectacle.Pros: Fun, breezy action with a fantastic range of highly imaginative weapons. Astonishing graphics, that show off the power of the PlayStation 5 very effectively.Cons: Shallow and surprisingly old-fashioned gameplay that doesn\u2019t make the most of the bizarre weapons and portal gimmicks. Disappointingly short and the script lacks bite.Score: 7/10Formats: PlayStation 5Price: \u00a369.99Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentDeveloper: Insomniac GamesRelease Date: 11th June 2021Age Rating: 7Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : Cross-gen development does not limit PS5 says Horizon Forbidden West director\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Sony announces Team Asobi expansion, hints at new Astro Bot PS5 game\n\n\n\n\tMORE : God Of War: Ragnar\u00f6k delayed till 2022 \u2013 will be PS4 and PS5 game\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.ukFor more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGame Informer, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a sequel that clings tightly to its storied heritage, never once betraying the foundation that was laid in 2002. From the second I took control of the fuzzy Lombax again, my muscle memory kicked in, and I was flipping through the air and smashing boxes like I had never stopped. Insomniac Games made a sequel for longtime fans that hits the right classic notes, feeling like a glorious reunion, even though these characters never left our side. The heavy doses of nostalgia are handled with care but are only half of what make this sequel a must-play for PlayStation 5\u2019s early adopters.Rift Apart is PlayStation 5\u2019s showpiece. It checks all of the next-gen boxes, dazzling with its power, speed, sound, and control. When coupled with this series\u2019 tried-and-true gameplay, the experience absolutely sizzles, creating a fun rollercoaster ride from start to finish.One of the coolest technological feats in Rift Apart is how Ratchet travels between dimensions. As he battles his way across an alien world, a window into another reality may appear in front of him, and he can bravely leap through it. The transition between locations happens in a flash, and Ratchet is suddenly standing in an entirely different world or reality.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7879a800-825b-4c11-991a-6c483e076d56": {"__data__": {"id_": "7879a800-825b-4c11-991a-6c483e076d56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0a6acff-cafd-4ede-aa53-a801b7e5adcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b02434fb0b5cfdbb8743a7e1f996ac1660353984bc1c57eb17124c7033c8b76"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c68e2b7-0279-4678-b08d-e85c30d6e3af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9dac91562d1b58cf1f9f43eaea3e2dbd952d7837f557680c9b98d151b2de4c89"}}, "hash": "fee2f367ed3a2b499c10d418ff70d57cb80522beafbc95e9a52f35d5c65139bf", "text": "These transitional moments are as magical and fun as they sound, often wowing you with just how different the next world is compared to the one you are currently standing in.Insomniac sometimes uses these quick transitions for exciting gameplay sequences, like riding an out-of-control beast at breakneck speeds through a series of dimensional rifts. Portals are also placed in combat areas to allow for quicker environmental traversal, a touch that sounds small, but adds another layer of strategy to the mix.Through a nicely penned story, we quickly learn Ratchet and Clank are bouncing between two specific dimensions, both holding the same planets and characters. The always amusing Doctor Nefarious thinks he has a better shot at conquering the alternate dimension. Since events have unfolded in different ways in each reality, the characters could be radically different. For instance, in the reality fans know, we have Skid McMarx, a burnout surfer who didn\u2019t do much. In the other dimension, Skid is a skilled resistance fighter named Phantom. Ratchet also appears to have a double in the other existence, and her name is Rivet, a new character who breathes fresh life into this series.Rivet energizes the story and is brought to life through a number of mysteries that give her a unique pulse. As her tale unfolds, Insomniac delivers satisfying answers as to who she is and what happened to her. She is playable for half of the adventure, but is sadly a carbon copy of Ratchet on the battlefield. She doesn\u2019t have any distinguishing features that set her apart. The duo shares the same weapons, upgrades, armors, and experience points earned \u2013 a solution that reduces confusion and keeps the focus on making progress that, again, strips each character of individuality. Yes, this plays into the duality of dimensions concept, and keeps the gameplay flowing in a consistent way, but it also feels like a missed opportunity to change things up and truly create a new character.While retaining the same colorful cartoon look we\u2019ve come to expect from each installment in this series, the level of detail in Rift Apart is through the roof in jaw-dropping ways. Don\u2019t be surprised if you stop dead in your tracks to inspect the detail on the most trivial of things. I marveled at the wool on a sheep, and audibly said \u201cwow\u201d when I saw the sheer scale of a Godzilla-sized robot that looms over one of the levels. I also realized that, given how densely populated areas are, it\u2019s a little harder to locate stacks of breakable boxes, which I consider a positive, as I was paying more attention to the environment. There\u2019s that much going on in each world. Insomniac\u2019s artists did a bang-up job dreaming up colorful alien worlds for the player to traverse. Trust me when I say you should play it in Performance RT mode (which delivers 60 frames-per-second and raytracing).The DualSense controller also mesmerizes at times, enhancing each weapon with tailored haptic feedback and clever adaptive trigger functionality. Each gun delivers a distinct and satisfying kick \u2013 whether it\u2019s the rhythmic pulsing of the Ricochet Gun or being able to feel the Negaton Collider cook in your hands before it sends out a rattle with its energy blast. I also really like how each gun offers two firing modes: a light tap of the trigger performs the first, which is usually more precise and conservative, and a full pull basically unleashes hell.This series has always been known for its inventive weapons and just how different they are from one another, and\u00a0Rift Apart\u00a0delivers\u00a0a nice selection of firearms that gives the player everything they need \u2013 like a rocket launcher and sniper rifle. The most inventive weapon this time around is the Topiary Sprinkler, which turns enemies into beautiful shrubbery, freezing their movements for a few seconds. This weapon, like many in this grouping, has great combo potential, and help keep mobs at bay. The new dimensional dash is the handiest new addition to combat, allowing for laser beams and melee strikes to be evaded with ease. This move also aids traversal in fun ways.Most missions that Ratchet and Rivet undertake are good fun, and often deliver huge set-piece moments with story sequences sewn right into them, just like Insomniac\u2019s Spider-Man games. You can freely move between planets and determine if you want to tackle a side mission or the next story beat. Some enemy types are repeated a little much (especially in the arena), but the action is nicely diversified, and the flow between locations is excellent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c68e2b7-0279-4678-b08d-e85c30d6e3af": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c68e2b7-0279-4678-b08d-e85c30d6e3af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "7879a800-825b-4c11-991a-6c483e076d56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fee2f367ed3a2b499c10d418ff70d57cb80522beafbc95e9a52f35d5c65139bf"}, "3": {"node_id": "592f4913-bbc4-48c7-9a7b-8214a29253b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5f2b4155054d76808e80cf56b93dda2c2007c46a3eae38d5356df840958e33a"}}, "hash": "9dac91562d1b58cf1f9f43eaea3e2dbd952d7837f557680c9b98d151b2de4c89", "text": "I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the Clank or spider-bot minigames, but they offer a breather at the right times from the frenzied combat.I had a smile on my face most of the way through Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart.

The game\u2019s protagonists take an elevator to a float as the infamous Captain Qwark summarizes the story of the original game (very convenient for newcomers to the franchise). But then I\u2019m distracted by a confetti cannon. With a single whack of Ratchet\u2019s wrench, the cannon fires hundreds of pieces of confetti into the air. The light shines around it, off the floats and the crowd, and the pieces of shredded paper lightly fall through the air. This is Rift Apart\u2019s \u201cnext-gen\u201d moment. Rift Apart is one of the first few games that\u2019s exclusive to the PlayStation 5, resting comfortably behind titles like Astro\u2019s Playroom, Demon\u2019s Souls, and Returnal. More than just being a fun Ratchet & Clank game, Rift Apart also showcases the power of this expensive new machine that\u2019s taking up a lot of shelf space in your home, if you managed to purchase one. And showcase it does, implementing some of the same incredible PS5-only features that Astro\u2019s Playroom showed off. But unlike Astro\u2019s, Rift Apart is a full-length adventure. Throughout my time with Rift Apart, I kept thinking of Sony Santa Monica\u2019s God of War (2018). I know, stay with me on this one. Both God of War and Ratchet & Clank are old staples for Sony, character action games that started well over a decade ago. With God of War\u2019s resurrection in 2018, Sony Santa Monica overhauled almost all of the series\u2019 familiar gameplay, making something new and better than before. Insomniac takes the opposite approach with Rift Apart, choosing to reinvent everything around the game while keeping the familiar, wacky weapons and third-person adventuring the primary focus.This is the most modern Ratchet & Clank game yet, adding a playable female lead named Rivet to adventure alongside Ratchet for the first time in 19 years. But it\u2019s also comfortable living with its legacy as a goofy, kid-friendly, character action game. As a longtime Ratchet & Clank fan, the game\u2019s structure and gameplay didn\u2019t surprise me. But that\u2019s OK. Rift Apart is doing so much to modernize the series through its systems, tech, and story that the familiarity of the gameplay is actually a great comfort. You can see the power of the PlayStation 5 through Rift Apart\u2019s visuals, but the most impressive developments come from the DualSense controller. When I move Ratchet forward and he steps down with his right foot, the right side of my controller makes the slightest rumble. The same thing happens with his left foot. As I sprint around the world, there\u2019s a small \u201cpitter-pat, pitter-pat, pitter-pat\u201d reverberating through my hands. When I break some boxes to collect bolts so I can buy new weapons, the controller rumbles, letting me feel the metal currency surge into Ratchet\u2019s pockets. When Ratchet and Clank come across a nightclub in the course of their latest adventure, I can hear the dubstep music playing through my speakers, but I can also feel the beat of the music pulsing through my controller. These vibrations are often subtle, but grounding. They keep me focused on the game, helping me visualize what my character is doing even if my eyes wander somewhere else.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "592f4913-bbc4-48c7-9a7b-8214a29253b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "592f4913-bbc4-48c7-9a7b-8214a29253b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c68e2b7-0279-4678-b08d-e85c30d6e3af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9dac91562d1b58cf1f9f43eaea3e2dbd952d7837f557680c9b98d151b2de4c89"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5ff2686-6d0c-4246-b5ec-b5c061e254a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5f78c189820b10cfa9b302bfd57b89388fc2ac7d623fb93644f6a0c31ed4ec2"}}, "hash": "f5f2b4155054d76808e80cf56b93dda2c2007c46a3eae38d5356df840958e33a", "text": "Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.The DualSense\u2019s most powerful features are its adaptive triggers, and of course, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart makes use of these as well. The game\u2019s massive arsenal of weaponry takes advantage of this system to create some truly bizarre combinations. There\u2019s a shotgun that can fire one barrel or two depending on how hard I pull the trigger. There\u2019s a seeker-missile weapon where a half-pull locks onto my target and a full pull launches it. One particularly interesting weapon is a shotgun/shield hybrid. Holding the trigger halfway will create a shield in front of either Ratchet or Rivet, but pulling the trigger the rest of the way will cause the shield to erupt forward, damaging enemies.The triggers help me control every weapon I have. Sometimes, the adaptive triggers drastically change how I use my weapon, while other times a half-pull will just let me aim without pulling the left trigger, helping me land my shots on Dr. Nefarious\u2019 baddies no matter what kind of situation I\u2019m in. Moments after the parade for our heroes starts, Rift Apart reveals the game\u2019s primary gimmick, which is right there in the name: rifts. Ratchet and Clank get sucked into a new dimension by Dr. Nefarious, and most of the game takes place there. But Nefarious broke time and space in the process, so rifts to other dimensions pop up on every planet. Dr. Nefarious uses some of these rifts to spawn enemies, but luckily, the game\u2019s heroes can use rifts to reach new areas. This effect is almost like a grappling hook, but it doesn\u2019t pull Ratchet toward an anchor. Instead of pulling Ratchet or Rivet to a point, I\u2019m pulling the point towards the hero \u2014 warping the world around them to further explore a planet or get us out of danger. It\u2019s an effect unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen before. It\u2019s a bit dizzying, but extremely impressive, and it never loses that \u201cwow\u201d factor.Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart provides a taste of the PlayStation 5\u2019s power. But the game\u2019s story and themes cement it as a more contemporary title. Rivet and Ratchet are two sides of the same whole, one who rose to become a hero because they met a friend, and the other rising to lead a resistance and disrupt an empire all on her own. Ratchet & Clank games have always poked fun at consumerism, capitalism, and corporate culture, but Rift Apart takes on totalitarianism and even the complexities of found-family dynamics. The story begins with Ratchet not only questioning if he\u2019s deserving of a heroic parade, but also his feelings of anxiety around disappointing the biological family he\u2019s never met. Then, the first time we see Rivet, she\u2019s sneaking through an all-robot city, risking her neck to steal intel and save the life of an organic citizen. It\u2019s a more emotional game than previous entries, saddled with old baggage and familiar problems for characters to try and understand. Rivet herself is also a harbinger of a new age, finally giving Ratchet & Clank fans a female voice in a series dominated by mostly male characters. It\u2019s a new era for Ratchet & Clank, even if its core structure remains the same.Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart works on multiple levels. It\u2019s an extremely impressive piece of software, designed to show off what Sony\u2019s latest console can do. But more importantly, it\u2019s a great entry in a nearly two-decade-old franchise, offering fans more wacky weapons, clever writing, and fresh biomes to explore. Rift Apart is an easy recommendation for any player lucky enough to get their hands on a PS5, for fans who can\u2019t get enough of Insomniac\u2019s heroic Lombax and his charming robot friend, and for players who want to meet a brave, new Lombax and go on an adventure with her, too.

In this strange new setting, everyone has a doppelganger who looks almost identical to the one we know, but their circumstances have changed them. Ratchet's new alternate dimensional counterpart, Rivet, may have had a harder life than him, and it's shaped her personality in surprising ways, but she's still the same heroic person at heart. The same can be said for Rift Apart. The new generation of hardware has made some dramatic changes for the better, but in a very welcome and comforting way, this is still the Ratchet & Clank you've come to know and love.The title may be \"Ratchet & Clank,\" but Rivet is the real star here. Ratchet and his robot buddy Clank are the template that helps inform what we learn about Rivet and her own journey, and the vast majority of Rift Apart takes place in her universe. She also seems to get slightly more playtime, even if the stages are split roughly evenly as the two heroes divide-and-conquer to enact their universe-saving plan.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart Video ReviewOnce the game begins in earnest, after a brief tutorial in Ratchet's Megalopolis, the bumbling but sinister Dr. Nefarious transports himself and the titular duo to another dimension. When Nefarious gets there, he finds that it's ruled by an Emperor Nefarious. The Emperor is conspicuously absent at the moment, so our Dr. Nefarious just helps himself to the throne, and no one, including the evil executive assistant, seems to notice that he's a pretender. Meanwhile Ratchet and Clank are separated, and Clank is picked up by the freedom fighter, Rivet.Most of the game centers around these dimensional counterparts, who are not exact twins but rather similar characters with different names and slightly different personalities in this new world. Rift Apart rewards longtime fans with little nudging winks on how the alternative characters break from our expectations. For example Mr. Zurkon, a violent autonomous robot that has been both a weapon and a character in past Ratchet games, now owns a bar with a strict no-fighting policy. Giving the alternate characters their own identities and names helps reduce what might otherwise be confusing dialogue about who matches who. Ratchet, naturally, thinks this mysterious lady Lombax has taken Clank, but thankfully the \"heroes in strife because of a misunderstanding\" trope is resolved quickly and they begin working together.But this game belongs to Rivet not just because it takes place in her dimension, but because she's such a fantastic addition to the larger Ratchet & Clank universe. Having finished Rift Apart, I would love to play a standalone Rivet game, set in this or any other dimension. Part of that is the performance of Jennifer Hale as Rivet, who introduces a disarming amount of emotional heft. Unlike Ratchet, Rivet has experienced a string of defeats from the oppressive Nefarious regime, and Hale imbues the character with little tinges of self-doubt and loneliness even as she maintains her heroic determination. This is a character like Ratchet who fights for justice, but she hasn't had a partner like Clank.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b39e4dd5-dab2-4f8b-af8a-81b0d02949fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b39e4dd5-dab2-4f8b-af8a-81b0d02949fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5ff2686-6d0c-4246-b5ec-b5c061e254a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5f78c189820b10cfa9b302bfd57b89388fc2ac7d623fb93644f6a0c31ed4ec2"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee3eb217-cd53-4cb0-bb01-d60b5faf918e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ecb491595430997a1a9468ba8a08709372f622ddd20c024e1c61fd923d556c47"}}, "hash": "9a8685aeaaaa8f5bbaf7972df8e122d39852a0cc1ee1ce4accc187f500feb07c", "text": "Ultimately, the story is a sweet-natured but relatively conventional one about friendship and trust, elevated above its conventions by Hale and the surrounding cast.Despite the fact that the dual heroes barely ever talk face-to-face, they share one pool of equipment. The game gives a sci-fi gobbledygook explanation, but more importantly, having one weapon wheel between both characters ensures that you can switch between your favorite guns without having to pause the fun and look for what you need. Ratchet is known for its inventive munitions, and aside from a handful of returning guns like the Warmonger and Buzz Blades, almost all of the weapons are new. They largely fit into familiar archetypes, but the PS5 DualSense makes a massive difference to how the weapons behave and how you interact with them.For the most part, the DualSense lets you control different functions with a half- or full-pull of the right trigger. The Negatron Collider, for example, is an energy beam that will charge up and then hold the charge at a half-pull, and fire at a full-pull. The default Burst Pistol swaps between a fairly accurate single-shot and a less-accurate triple-shot. Several of the grenade-types use the half-pull as a targeting reticle. These functions seem deceptively simple but once I got into a rhythm, it felt completely natural to call up functions without a second thought, encouraging me to experiment with satisfyingly complex strategies. For example, a favorite of mine, the Blackhole Storm, is a gatling gun that spins up at a half-pull and then fires at full. With a little experimenting, I found you can keep it spinning without firing by easing up on the trigger, saving ammo but keeping the weapon at the ready. It's that kind of smart implementation that makes the DualSense functionality more impactful than a mere gimmick.Even the DualSense speaker is welcome. I never enjoyed the controller speaker on the DualShock 4, but here it's used to subtly signal when your weapon is charged, or to give you a crisp and satisfying ting-ting sound of collecting bolts. At some points the haptic vibration and speaker prompts blend so seamlessly it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.Smart implementation makes the DualSense functionality more impactful than a mere gimmick.Like past Ratchet games, the weapon upgrades come in two complementary tracks. The first simply upgrades your weapon through use, so the more you use your favorite weapons, the faster they'll upgrade. The other is obtained by purchasing nodes on an upgrade tree with Raritanium, a limited resource scattered throughout the planets. The upgrade tree unlocks more nodes as you upgrade the weapon through use, so the two systems sync together very well.Some of the weapons feel a little off with how many uses it takes to earn an upgrade, though. The Ricochet gun, which bounces off your enemies like a pinball, upgraded much later than some of my other weapons even with heavy use, and very specialized or situational weapons like the Bombardier or Cold Snap are achingly slow to upgrade. Playing a Ratchet game as I do--where I basically abandon any weapon that's already maxed except in cases of emergency--I started to find that the very situational weapons were lopsided toward the back half. That meant that I spent the last handful of encounters firing off low-level weapons so as to not \"waste\" the experience before switching to my fully upgraded arsenal to actually take the fight seriously.Rift Apart is an action platformer, and Insomniac has built further on its already robust traversal options from past games. Complementing the usual suite of jumps, rocket boots, and contextual swinging mechanics are two new moves: the Rift Tether and the Phantom Dash. The Rift Tether pulls you into a dimensional hole in such a way that it looks as if the world is moving around you, while the Phantom Dash lets you phase out of reality and functions like a dodge roll. In the platforming segments, these combine with the existing Ratchet & Clank mainstays to make for some breathless, harrowing setpieces, as you transfer from rail-grinding to wall-running to rift-tethering with reckless abandon.Even better, these traversal tools sing when you apply them in combat scenarios, especially in tougher encounters when you're swarmed with enemies. The Rift Tether lets you close distances or get away for a breather quickly, and the Phantom Dash feels different than a standard jumping dodge because it breaks the continuity of your fire--including the charge for weapons like the Negatron Collider.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee3eb217-cd53-4cb0-bb01-d60b5faf918e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee3eb217-cd53-4cb0-bb01-d60b5faf918e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "b39e4dd5-dab2-4f8b-af8a-81b0d02949fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a8685aeaaaa8f5bbaf7972df8e122d39852a0cc1ee1ce4accc187f500feb07c"}, "3": {"node_id": "11d429a5-6f19-4ea9-8fd3-f0ea8db48b8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33f01b8fa272b1d4e9897e7084e250d8ce131b54898dd064fe20e9900ef765bb"}}, "hash": "ecb491595430997a1a9468ba8a08709372f622ddd20c024e1c61fd923d556c47", "text": "Whether you want to risk a dodging jump to hold your fire or play it safe with a Phantom Dash is the kind of split-second risk-reward decision that makes combat feel exciting.Not all of the traversal is quite as satisfying, though. A few times you have to jump on the back of a pterodactyl-like creature named Trudi to navigate a particular stage or snag some collectibles. While it's seemingly intended to add variety, the beast feels sluggish and temperamental compared to the smooth and intuitive controls of Ratchet and Rivet. These segments are short enough that they don't detract too much from the overall experience, but they stand out as a weak spot when compared to the rest.More successfully, Insomniac mixes in moments of variety with two types of puzzle stages. A series of Clank puzzles has you placing orbs with different effects (like super-speed or heavy weight) to guide a constantly running line of Clank \"possibilities,\" Lemmings-like, toward a goal. A more action-oriented puzzle section, featuring an adorable spider-robot named Glitch, has you unlocking and then zapping viruses to open computer systems. Similar to the guns and bolt pickups, the tap-tap-tap of Glitch's tiny metallic legs sound and feel very satisfying on the DualSense. These interstitial segments aren't deep enough to support their own games, but they're a welcome brief change of pace in this one.Those puzzles are also entirely skippable if you find they're not to your taste. The challenges and Trophies aren't gated by difficulty level, and you can use accessibility options like the slowdown mechanic to finesse your way past tricky parts. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart comes across as a game that's comfortable in its own skin and unafraid to let you engage on your own terms. Not into this or that? \"Hey man, that's cool,\" it seems to say. \"Just enjoy the rest, we're all here to have a good time.\"All of this is delivered in such a refined, recognizable package that the technical prowess on display doesn't often call attention to itself. The Rift Tethers refresh your perspective almost instantaneously. Cutscenes and gameplay blend so seamlessly together you might often miss the transition. Pocket dimensions hidden throughout planets open an entirely separate environment that feel like they've punched a hole in the fabric of space. A couple of particular planets let you switch back and forth between entire realities in a snap. And load times are non-existent, either so fast that you'd never notice or hidden behind scene transitions. It makes the whole game feel cinematic and harmonious in a natural, unselfconscious way.If you do pause for a moment to take it in, it will be to gawk at the stunning visuals. The environments are richly detailed and differentiated. Both the enemies and major characters have the kinds of stretchy, expressive faces and inventive design elements you'd see in an animated feature film. The textures are so well-realized you can practically feel the difference between Clank's shiny steel and other types of painted or rough metals. Each time I reached a new planet, I would take a few moments to just rotate the camera and soak it all in. It's just astounding to look at, even if that level of visual fidelity isn't as noticeable when you're in the thick of the action.Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is flashy and technically impressive without feeling self-important. It's just as silly, sweet, and earnest as the Ratchet & Clank series tends to be, while the new generation of hardware makes this entry look and play better than ever. Like the heroes and villains and their dimensional counterparts, this one may appear different or carry itself with a new accent, but there's an underlying truth to the person underneath. At its core, it's still your trusty old pals on another grand space adventure. That's what's important.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nDestructoid, darkWe\u2019re finally at the point in history where we can say\u00a0PS5 games are coming out.

The MCU-quality soundtrack is the final ingredient to this cinematic soup. Given that this is a ground-up PS5 game, there are basically no loads, and the DualSense rumbles so hard it practically slaps you in the face.It\u2019s also nice to get full HUD control. There\u2019s accessibility options that include common courtesy quality-of-life upgrades like camera sensitivity, a screen-shake toggle, and plenty of visual tweaks. You can even customize shaders for enemy types for color blindness. I had one classic \u201cPS5 game\u201d crash, but other than that, it was smooth sailing. For reference, fidelity mode, which you\u2019ll see in this video here, was the only option available to us. Performance mode is coming via a day one patch, but the performance was just fine on the former.Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart\u00a0itself is extremely clever in how it sets up the narrative framework. Insomniac knows there\u2019s going to be a lot of newcomers here, so the tutorial intro doubles as a \u201cparade float\u201d recap; where an announcer will explain Ratchet and Clank\u2019s former exploits in a quick and digestive manner. Naturally, things go south very quickly, Doctor Nefarious gets involved, and oh snap we\u2019re in a multiverse hellscape.[brid video=\u201d796427\u2033 player=\u201d12899\u2033 title=\u201dRatchet%20&%20Clank%20Rift%20Apart%20Review\u201d duration=\u201d321\u2033 description=\u201dDestructoid\u2019s review of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart.In today\u2019s review, Chris Carter traverses the Lombax multiverse and gives you the critical analysis you need for Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart!

The time has come for Ratchet to meet another one of his kind, and we get just that with newcomer Rivet. There are alternate reality tropes galore, including returning characters that aren\u2019t quite the same as they were before, and it\u2019s a riot for long-term fans. Of course, you do get some quick exposition so you aren\u2019t completely lost if you come in blind. We also get some deep cuts and plenty of audio logs. Two words: Lombax lore.Ratchet also ramps up the mechanical elements too. My absolute favorite thing about\u00a0Rift Apart is how it incentivizes leveling individual weapons. The upgrade trees are just big enough to the point where it doesn\u2019t get cumbersome, and the perks are\u00a0just good enough where you can feel the difference after plopping points into them. The team as a whole did a good job making weapons diverse and useful, to avoid the common trope of just min-maxing your favorite (or the cookie-cutter effective gun).Combat is also pretty interactive due to the \u201cphantom dash\u201d that allows ground and aerial movement, which is secured fairly early on, and the ability to pull into rifts scattered around the battlefield. It leads to some predictable skirmish arenas where you can\u2019t leave until you\u2019ve vanquished \u201cx\u201d amount of foes, but between yanking on portals and dashing around, the action is extremely mobile.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1f4320f-4314-4064-a7a9-17b20e7ba113": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1f4320f-4314-4064-a7a9-17b20e7ba113", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "11d429a5-6f19-4ea9-8fd3-f0ea8db48b8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33f01b8fa272b1d4e9897e7084e250d8ce131b54898dd064fe20e9900ef765bb"}, "3": {"node_id": "71b2029c-afbf-4e32-8216-0566dbabbd18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "52d4f80c64d5e8047b94938d4e62c55c76d300dfa3d3f23914cfcf42e008d5db"}}, "hash": "9d7174dbc13e658b8c43e58a4ce783ff70d2149c770b6ad4a4eceef4310b6e80", "text": "If you\u2019re an action-platformer vet, you\u2019ll probably want to jack up the difficulty one notch above the default.So as you may have intimated from the arena comment, there is a bit of fatigue that sets in periodically. Rivet is a fun character (voiced by the always-professional Jennifer Hale), but she basically is just a mirror image of Ratchet, and even duplicates his exact loadout. (There\u2019s an in-universe explanation for this, but it\u2019s a bit awkward.) Samey minibosses are a bigger problem, as you\u2019ll square off against the same version of \u201cgiant robot that slams and has a rocket launcher\u201d many, many times. Thankfully the pacing is on-point and these sections, while too frequent, are easy to power through. At its core, it still has the same arcadey \u201chit crates, get big swirly shinies\u201d aspect, too.To that end, the Clank puzzles are great palate cleansers. As a sort of mix between\u00a0Portal and\u00a0Lemmings, you\u2019ll take control of your little robot buddy in an attempt to mend some of the rifts on the fritz. They\u2019re short, and sweet \u2014 a common theme for Rift Apart, which tries not to overstay its welcome. The Mario Sunshine-like challenge rifts that Ratchet and Rivet can partake in are very similarly satisfying, as is the optional battle arena minigame. The strong platforming system holds it all together like glue.Beyond all that, there\u2019s plenty of optional sidequests to embark upon, and Insomniac brings back the helpful Spider-Man method of just telling you where nearly every collectible is on the map. It saves a ton of wasted time while allowing for some surprises, and it\u2019s much appreciated. The main story, with some exploring, will take most people around eight hours (some will do it in less). After all is said and done, there\u2019s a \u201cchallenge mode\u201d that gives you more bolts in exchange for a tougher playthrough, functionally serving as a New Game+ option.Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart isn\u2019t afraid to revel in its mascot-platformer roots, but it manages to knock so many of its competitors completely out of the water. The secret sauce? Insomniac knows that a strong presentation goes a long way, and they\u2019ve stretched this formula about as far as it can go with plenty of customization and a compelling world to play around in. While it\u2019s uneven at times, it\u2019ll suck you into the universe of Ratchet & Clank all over again.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

Enter Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, which brings old heroes into a shiny new spotlight for their best adventure yet, and the first PS5 game that\u2019s accessible to all players.Rift Apart features classic characters mixed in with some key new additions (that, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, will be kept vague here). These new additions are successfully integrated and I appreciate the risk that Insomniac Games took with how the story is split up.All characters are working together to achieve a common goal, which is linked to the rifts that have been tearing reality apart in the various trailers and gameplay demos. This task forces the characters to travel across nine different planets, each boasting a main mission, side content, and collectibles. Each new planet demands a pit stop for a lengthy Photo Mode session. The game is just that jaw-dropping gorgeous.Those sticking to the main story will take 8-10 hours to beat the game on the default difficulty, though it\u2019s easy to get distracted by side quests and their exciting rewards.\u00a0While some bosses could stand to be more challenging with expanded movesets, I came away satisfied by the journey. The great ending is the cherry on top of a superb, Pixar-esque adventure.Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart has\u00a0a lot\u00a0going on, the most noteworthy being its implementation of the rifts,\u00a0a mechanic that sees players transported almost instantaneously to another world to continue the fighting in real-time. Moving between worlds, especially during a boss encounter, is a thrill. Though these world-changing rifts aren\u2019t used as often as I would like, the moments when they do occur are special.The other type of rift is more minor, appearing on the battlefield and acting more as a glorified grapple hook point. They can prove useful for quickly initiating or escaping close-quarters engagements. Combined with the new dodge and sprint mechanics, as well as tighter-feeling evade controls, Rift Apart\u2019s movement feels awesome. Oh, the way the hover boots work on all planets is just fantastic for speeding around quickly.That awesome movement is paired with a devastating arsenal of weapons. I count 20 weapons in total and they are all upgradeable in various ways. There\u2019s a mixture of conventional and wacky weaponry for players to master. I found ammo scarcity to be suitably tough on the default difficulty, forcing me to switch between multiple guns to finish a fight. While swinging around and switching between my Cold Snap to freeze a large enemy, to\u00a0the Glove of Doom to spawn some explosive bot teammates, to the\u00a0Blackhole Storm to deal some rapid-firing damage, it felt like I was playing a family-friendly installment of the rebooted Doom series. It\u2019s chaotic and I love it.The battlegrounds where these hectic firefights are fought are a mixture of tightly packed rooms and surprisingly large open areas. Helpfully, the latter can be quickly traversed in some very fun ways. However, those hunting for every last secret will want to take it slow.Some would argue that a Ratchet and Clank game is only good as its Arena Mode. After all, it\u2019s where a lot of players will be spending their time grinding through the various weapon levels and farming resources. Rift Apart\u2019s Arena is good enough, providing a variety of combat and racing challenges, but I fear hardcore R&C fans will be left wanting more from this next-gen version. Insomniac is no stranger to post-launch support, so perhaps the Arena will be fleshed out with online leaderboards and limited-time challenges, although co-op would be my top request.Though Arena falls a little flat when it comes to replayability, it is fortunately saved by Rift Apart\u2019s endgame. Challenge Mode is unlocked after completing the game once. It lets players continue with their weapon progress and unlocks additional gun levels that further increase firepower. Then there are the well-hidden collectibles, the locations of which can be tracked down using the PS5\u2019s hints feature. Finally, there are the side missions, one of which awards players with the most powerful weapon in the game. Diehard R&C fans will want to wield this!Last, but certainly by no means least, are the accessibility options. The devs at Insomniac have clearly worked hard to make their game playable by as many people as possible and it\u2019s great to see.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66e3de17-c0aa-40ad-a69b-239b57b715e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "66e3de17-c0aa-40ad-a69b-239b57b715e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "71b2029c-afbf-4e32-8216-0566dbabbd18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "52d4f80c64d5e8047b94938d4e62c55c76d300dfa3d3f23914cfcf42e008d5db"}, "3": {"node_id": "e5bd4e9b-eba1-4aef-8c8e-5ed5bb720f68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "df8f9dc20097b382d98a73dbd10ec4e6528f33ba690d2785b5892fa65088a5fe"}}, "hash": "c11fc59be4c7770ab552d5704ef581b299aaf85cf9f28607d5fe576f496e4b9d", "text": "There is an extensive list of options including combat and traversal assists, visual adjustments including high contrast to make things stand out, a variety of controller shortcuts, and the ability to slow down the game speed to as low as 30%.Just as Ratchet and Clank\u2019s story evokes comparisons to Pixar\u2019s animated films, that description extends to the visuals, too. It\u2019s with next-gen hardware like the PS5 that games can now look this good. The fact that these images can be processed in real-time honestly boggles the mind. Further mindblowing is the use of ray tracing, which I initially spotted while toying with the Photo Mode. Reflections in Ratchet\u2019s helmet and also in the rubies (a cosmetic alternative for the bolts currency) are way beyond anything that could have been achieved on Sony\u2019s last-gen console.But it\u2019s not just graphics geeks like me who will notice these things about Rift Apart\u2019s presentation, as the game has three visual modes: 60 FPS, a 60 FPS with ray tracing, and 30 FPS higher fidelity modes. It\u2019s the same graphics magic that was seen in Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man. I imagine most will go for 60 FPS with ray tracing enabled, though the other options are there for those looking to prioritize resolution on bigger screens.Like other dedicated exclusives, Rift Apart makes use of the PS5\u2019s fast SSD and DualSense\u2019s advanced features. Both successfully enhance the presentation and gameplay experiences with additions like blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-them loading times, advanced haptics for next-level vibrations, and adaptive triggers that help to make each weapon stand out. These contribute to the game to such an extent that it\u2019s obvious why there isn\u2019t, and likely never will be, a PS4 version.Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is the first PS5 exclusive that I can recommend everyone\u00a0go out and buy. It\u2019s a cutting-edge masterclass of what the PS5 is capable of, but with the soul of the original R&C games, packaged with a comprehensive set of accessibility options.Players should find 20-30 hours of enjoyment here with side content and the Platinum Trophy considered. I feel that most players will want to invest those hours and claim the 100% Trophy award across multiple playthroughs, as Rift Apart\u2019s story, gameplay, and presentation is a triumphant trifecta that Insomniac Games has made almost perfect.Game Revolution reviewed Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart on PS5.

Our review.The last time PlayStation owners saw Ratchet & Clank, the heroic duo was at a bit of a crossroads. Insomniac had just taken the team back to their roots, rebooting their original adventure for a new generation on PS4. Now that Insomniac firmly reestablished Ratchet & Clank's place in the PlayStation pantheon, the question became \"What's next? What comes after reestablishment?\" The answer is \"expansion.\" Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is the next big step in the series, exploring the lombax's world through a whole new other-dimensional lens. If the PS4 Ratchet & Clank was a return to form for the series, Rift Apart on the PS5 is a display of excellence.Rift Apart's story starts with a celebration of Ratchet & Clank and their various heroics. As their home world throws them a parade, Clank gives Ratchet a gift in the form of a rebuilt Dimensionator, a dimension-hopping device seen in a couple of previous Ratchet & Clank games. The festivities are soon interrupted by Dr. Nefarious, who takes the Dimensionator and hops into a totally different dimension, dragging Ratchet and Clank along for the ride until they're both separated.Clank finds himself in a world ruled by Emperor Nefarious and is ultimately found by this dimension's version of Ratchet, a female lombax named Rivet. Rift Apart's story is a memorable one and the reasons for that start with Rivet. She's more than a mere \"girl Ratchet\" and a big part of that is because of the circumstances of her surroundings.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5bd4e9b-eba1-4aef-8c8e-5ed5bb720f68": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5bd4e9b-eba1-4aef-8c8e-5ed5bb720f68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "66e3de17-c0aa-40ad-a69b-239b57b715e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c11fc59be4c7770ab552d5704ef581b299aaf85cf9f28607d5fe576f496e4b9d"}, "3": {"node_id": "67592515-f3b0-4d25-93fb-55cae20882be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a924518d520be1a0c7c247a1fed9fbc217a99da1fdadab72f829cbb642bc3b1"}}, "hash": "df8f9dc20097b382d98a73dbd10ec4e6528f33ba690d2785b5892fa65088a5fe", "text": "With Nefarious having taken over her dimension, Rivet is driven underground to lead up a resistance. The resistance has become a major component of her identity. She's given everything, including her right arm, to try and stop Nefarious. However, while her dimension is a far drearier one than Ratchet's, she's still fueled by optimism, friendship, and the hope that her efforts will ultimately pay off. Rivet's interactions with Clank, the ultra-polite Morts of the planet Sargasso, the various patrons of Zurkie's, and the game's other main characters are a highlight and she'll likely go down as one of 2021's best new characters.Rivet's dimension, as a whole, makes Rift Apart feel like an epic story. Players will encounter parallel counterparts to many of the Ratchet & Clank supporting cast and those meetings often don't go the way one would expect. There are a couple of characters in the late game, in particular, who manage to deliver some big laughs, as well as evoke some unexpected emotion. The whole story plays out like a Saturday morning cartoon on a much grander scale and it's a joy to watch unfold.Insomniac is coming off giving the original Ratchet & Clank a visual overhaul and those who liked what the PS4 did for that game will marvel over what the PS5 accomplishes with Rift Apart. The PS5 version of the game pulls off many of the feats of the series' PS4 predecessor, like gorgeously detailing the game's characters. Even outside the beautiful cutscenes, the level of detail on the lombaxes is stunning, from their facial expressions to their fur textures. The game's supporting characters and its many enemies get the same kind of love. The movements of the Goons and the Pirates, in particular, are astounding, though Insomniac somehow manages to illustrate some wacky movements on the Emperor's robots, giving them their own injection of personality as you blast them.Rift Apart's worlds are richly detailed and no two look the same. Without spoiling some of the game's later stages, it's a wonder how Insomniac was able to differentiate stages by their look and size, but also by their objectives and overall tone. While all of the stages will utilize Ratchet & Clank's typical 3D platforming formula to an extent, some will require different sets of objectives to go along with the series' signature shooting gallery sequences. Some objectives will involve grinding on rails, others will involve racing on Speetles, others might require some skill jumps with Hoverboots, and others will require bouncing back and forth between dimensions.In fact, it's the dimension-hopping element where the PS5 gets to flex its muscles. As a result of the unstable dimension rifts, Ratchet and Rivet can tether entire dimension rifts to execute one of gaming's fanciest teleport moves. The rift tethers are most often used for traversal, but they'll also be available when up against waves of enemies. Amazingly, there are no performance hitches during these sequences, including near the end of the game, when Rift Apart throws dozens upon dozens of enemies onto the screen simultaneously. With no performance hitches and no loading screens of any kind, Rift Apart feels like a technical feat and something that should hopefully be an industry standard moving forward. I did hit one or two technical hitches with objectives not loading over my 12 hours, but the quick reload made that feel like much less of an annoyance.While Ratchet and Rivet don't quite fall through the voids between dimensions as much as Rift Apart's trailers would have one believe, that doesn't make their worlds feel any less impressive. These are beautifully detailed landscapes with a lot happening, whether it's the bustling metropolis of Nefarious City or the rocky mining colonies of Blizar Prime. They made me want to go off the beaten path and explore, which is a good thing, as it turned out, because there are pocket dimensions and other hidden collectibles for those who take the extra time to look around.Ratchet & Clank has great 3D platforming and Rift Apart is no different. However, the series is mainly known for its selection of weaponry. I'm happy to say that Rift Apart's weapons are a hoot and a half.Beyond the standard Blast Pistol, Rift Apart has dozens of weapons (enough to fill two weapon wheels) that all bring hurt in different ways. Some are straightforward, like the Warmonger rocket launcher and the Blackhole Storm gatling gun. Others bring the creativity that's almost expected of this franchise. Examples include Mr.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67592515-f3b0-4d25-93fb-55cae20882be": {"__data__": {"id_": "67592515-f3b0-4d25-93fb-55cae20882be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5bd4e9b-eba1-4aef-8c8e-5ed5bb720f68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "df8f9dc20097b382d98a73dbd10ec4e6528f33ba690d2785b5892fa65088a5fe"}, "3": {"node_id": "38d553e5-0e62-4864-85f9-bdc9f4fd5add", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "22182220b01cff7b68b524b349a3dbc2f5c2cd2d17c4609022fd239efd94aae7"}}, "hash": "6a924518d520be1a0c7c247a1fed9fbc217a99da1fdadab72f829cbb642bc3b1", "text": "Others bring the creativity that's almost expected of this franchise. Examples include Mr. Fungal, a remote mushroom turret that draws attention by trying to annoy enemies; the Topiary Sprinkler, which stuns foes by growing hedges all around them; and the Glove of Doom, which summons multiple ankle-biting robots to attack any enemy in their sight. Rift Apart's weaponry stands out because the PS5's DualSense controller allows for players to utilize different functions, depending on how much pressure they apply to the trigger. A half-press will attack in a different way, compared to a full button press, allowing for different approaches to enemies.All of Rift Apart's weapons can be upgraded by using the Raritonium currency, which is used to purchase buffs on a weapon's skill tree. I will comment that deciding which weapons to give a boost to can sometimes be stressful. Every single fallen enemy will drop bits to spend with Ms. Zircon, but even that won't often be enough to buy everything on a lombax's wish list. Buying every weapon and getting every upgrade are worthwhile goals for those looking to play through the game multiple times, but I sometimes wish the upgrading process was a little more straightforward.Rift Apart isn't all just shooting at enemies, though. The action is occasionally broken up with some all-new puzzle sequences. In order to close particularly dangerous rifts, Clank will sometimes have to break off into his own puzzle sections, where players will have to navigate dozens of Clank \"possibilities\" to a goal. This involves the use of various orb types, which can either launch, speed up, or weigh down the possibilities. They're fun brain teasers that aren't too difficult and don't often get in the way of the main gameplay loop.There aren't too many sequences with Ratchet's miniature computer buddy Glitch, either. However, this is probably for the best. Players will have to sometimes use Glitch to clear out computer corruptions by blasting viruses. It's a decent idea with the series' action-heavy spirit in mind, but Glitch's slow and awkward movements didn't strike me as particularly enjoyable. To reiterate an earlier point to Insomniac's credit, though, Glitch sequences can pack in dozens of enemies at a time and players won't notice any performance hiccups at all. At least that's something.Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a masterpiece. It would have been enough for Insomniac to keep the series' core spirit alive and add a few new ideas that take advantage of the PS5 hardware. This game certainly does do that. However, it's the creativity in the game's weaponry, the lovable characters, the engaging story with its Saturday morning cartoon atmosphere, the exciting worlds, and the game's penchant for clever humor that made Rift Apart feel special.Whether you've had adventures with Ratchet & Clank in the past or not, Rift Apart is not a game to be missed. It's one of the best games you can get for your PS5 and one of the best games of 2021 so far, period.This review is based on a PlayStation 5 digital code provided by the publisher. Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart will be available on the PlayStation Store on Thursday, June 11 for $69.99 USD. The game is rated E10+.Ozzie has been playing video games since picking up his first NES controller at age 5. He has been into games ever since, only briefly stepping away during his college years. But he was pulled back in after spending years in QA circles for both THQ and Activision, mostly spending time helping to push forward the Guitar Hero series at its peak. Ozzie has become a big fan of platformers, puzzle games, shooters, and RPGs, just to name a few genres, but he\u2019s also a huge sucker for anything with a good, compelling narrative behind it. Because what are video games if you can't enjoy a good story with a fresh Cherry Coke?\n\t\t\t\t\tOzzie Mejia posted a new article, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart review - A dimension above the rest \n\t\t\t\t\t\"Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart is a masterpiece.\" :D I might need a PS5 now.\t\t\t\t\nVG247, As I played through the opening minutes of Insomniac's PS5 exclusive, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, I was taken back to childhood.

There's hyperbole and then there's just acknowledging the inspiring work done here. Just, wow.This show stopping intro sets up the game's story and introduces the rift mechanic alluded to in the title. Doctor Nefarious causes havoc with a rift gun, resulting in some dimensional shenanigans, such as portals from other dimensions opening up all over the place and newcomer Rivet (another Lombax) arriving with a fair few similarities to Ratchet. The newly formed Lombax duo (although they spend a lot of the game apart) must take on a more formidable foe in the shape of a parallel universe Nefarious who happens to be the ruler of his galaxy and wants to exert his power across the universes. Essentially, expect lots of planet hopping, rift jumping, and more than a few evil plans.When you're running around as either Ratchet or newcomer Rivet, Rift Apart is essentially a 3D platformer crossed with a third-person shooter. As ever with the series, the combat is great, the weapons are brilliant, and moving through the environments is always fun. Insomniac nailed the feel of the Ratchet games many years ago, so iterating on the winning formula is completely fine in my book.The series is known for its vast array of unique weapons, and Insomniac doesn't disappoint here. A truckload of cool weapons of destruction can be obtained as you work through the game, using bolts to buy whatever Ms Zurkon has in her store and raritanium to purchase upgrades. Each weapon will level up as you use it, on top of the upgrades you buy via the grid system seen in previous games. This grid lets you unlock bonus upgrades if you encircle locked grid tiles. It was neat in the previous games so there was absolutely no need to meddle with it here, and by the end of the game you should be packing quite the arsenal.One point to note is that you share your entire inventory between Ratchet and Rivet. It doesn't matter who the game puts you in control of (when you travel to a different planet the game lets you know who you'll be playing as), you'll have the same weapons for both, all upgraded to the same level. There is a line about how this makes sense in the context of dimension jumping, but the key thing is that it was the right design choice and simplifies everything.The two lombax play identically, which is to say they handle more or less like Ratchet has in the past, although there is a new dodge mechanic that comes in very handy during battles and with some more advanced platforming. Hover boots also give you a swift way to move around the often very large semi-open areas the game lets you explore. R1 initiates the boosters, and tapping R2 gets you up to top speed, allowing you to make use of the thoughtfully placed ramps to catch some \"big air\" as the kids say.Insomniac once again takes great delight in taking you to loads of diverse, gorgeous locations - this time with some stunning dimension-shifting mechanics in play. At a basic level you can use rifts to teleport yourself to a rift's location in your immediate play area, kind of like using a grappling hook, but the real technologically impressive stuff happens during fast-paced race sequences as you seamlessly move from one world to another or when you hit a rift crystal to near-instantly change the dimension of the world you're in, showing two distinct versions. It's amazing to see and feels so tightly woven into the story that it's far from a gimmick.The Ratchet & Clank games have often thrown in sections played with characters other than Ratchet, and here you get to solve puzzles as Clank and shoot viruses as Glitch in computer terminals. The Clank levels see many, many iterations of Clank running through abstract-looking stages, with the goal being to help them reach the goal by using property altering orbs. These must be placed on pads to speed up the Clanks, weigh them down, or lift them up, or to provide power to objects in the level. Figuring out how to obtain the orbs in the first place is part of the puzzle, and while I never found myself completely at a loss over what to do, I did scratch my head in thought a number of times.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1ba73a4-eee4-45b3-a717-3b631338ce50": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1ba73a4-eee4-45b3-a717-3b631338ce50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2e92f360-a2ac-483e-acbd-df03274e13e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "086fca14e882540e17912003fe7235aa8b9dda55d75a6068bed13548cf2b0b68"}, "2": {"node_id": "38d553e5-0e62-4864-85f9-bdc9f4fd5add", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "22182220b01cff7b68b524b349a3dbc2f5c2cd2d17c4609022fd239efd94aae7"}, "3": {"node_id": "d27ab129-3082-4583-ada5-16fc7d4d11f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3114d00b0369f8e3b419ccdd8c852ea8fa722dd79de7323a293a5adf655753d0"}}, "hash": "b6b2520641f22d4a53d5f79f09de9c8674615813fd4a3a54c3c6b0a2f5f9536b", "text": "Shooting viruses in a spider-tank of sorts is the weaker of the two additional gameplay offerings, but it's still far better than any symbol matching hacking mini-game, and both side offerings play into the core story rather than simply acting as roadblocks to extend the experience.As ever there are plenty of collectibles to track down throughout the numerous levels, side quests to take on (although don't think you're getting an RPG's worth here), and combat challenges to complete in order to unlock rewards. I found myself wanting to do everything in order to spend as much time in this world as possible, such as it is packed with neat twists on familiar characters and a handful of superb new additions. Some planets offer more fun than others, with my preference being the more open outdoor areas to the confined indoor sequences, while some place an emphasis on combat and fast movement over puzzles and platforming. Variety is strong here, but the quality never disappoints.We've had showpiece games for new consoles in the past (Sonic Adventure on the Dreamcast, The Bouncer on PS2, Ryse on Xbox One, Killzone Shadowfall on PS4\u2026 the list goes on) but rarely do they offer the gameplay experience to back up the spectacle. Insomniac has become one of the safest pairs of hands in gaming, so it shouldn't be a surprise to learn that Rift Apart most definitely isn't just a superbly lit show pony.This is a full-fat, planet-hopping, mystery-filled adventure that PS5 owners will lap up and non-owners will resent not being able to play, perhaps through no lack of trying. Miles Morales and Demon's Souls were superb launch titles for the PS5, but we're now through the looking glass. The bar has been set.
