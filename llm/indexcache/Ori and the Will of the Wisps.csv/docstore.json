The luminescence smothers the thicket like a warm, snug blanket, dusting the world with a soft, preternatural radiance, piping the edges of the leaves and twigs that dance as you glide and tumble past them, leaving them trembling in your wake. Ori dances, too. They leap from platform to vine to outcrop, their acrobatics growing in scope and confidence as their skill-set expands. You'll be routinely rewarded for your exploration and the idle curiosity that takes you off the beaten path, and soon enough, you'll be voluntarily throwing yourself into the air, bouncing off projectiles and enemies and lanterns with a confidence that'll astonish you. Nothing feels copy-and-pasted or created by rote. Every twig and leaf and cloud has detail and purpose. The biomes you explore - each one feeling simultaneously both familiar and new - have been crafted with care and affection, stuffed with bespoken motifs and secret little hideyholes. There are distinct areas with their own friends, foes and landmarks, and plenty of opportunities to revisit old stomping grounds when you learn how to access a previously inaccessible pathway. There are deserts and snow-capped mountains and lush, tranquil pools and caverns with suffocating darkness. The world itself is a tangible, moody NPC all of its own, and it's one with a shockingly poor poker face; the further into the story you tread, the more it will telegraph exactly what's at stake here. Will of the Wisps is an immediate successor to Blind Forest that continues Ori's tale, albeit in a slightly different way. The sequel has ramped up the combat, expanding Ori's arsenal to include a heap of new weaponry and skills to enable you to fight confidently and competently. Spirit Shards, too, add passive abilities, although it's surprising how many of the most effective ones - such as Sticky Walls and Life Pact - unlock early game, perhaps curtailing organic experimentation.It's hard to talk about the soft-touch story without indelibly smudging it with my careless fingerprints, so I'll do us both a favour and not even try. However, I will promise it's everything you expect/hope/want, especially if you spent any quality time with its predecessor. You play as titular Ori, brutally separately from your pal, Ku, and sent through the sprawling reaches of Niwen in search of them. It's a tale of love and loss and loyalty, and of how everyone - and everything - beats its own path in this world. Things are often not what they seem, and heartbreak can corrupt even the brightest of souls. Yes, it made me cry. Yes, I cried more than once. Though a truncated cast, Ori and the Will of the Wisps features expressive, memorable characters that masterfully convey the contents of their hearts without ever saying a word.\r\nI have a love/hate relationship with Metroidvanias - the term we give to this flavour of action-platformers that blends combat and exploration and sends you scurrying across a vast, interconnected world - chiefly because of my dexterity (or lack thereof). Will of the Wisps, however, feels a tad more forgiving than others, making it considerably more accessible for newcomers. Yes, there are several tricky sequences that require quick thinking and even faster reflexes, but it's with relief that I can confidently confirm they weren't prohibitively complex. The combat, however? That's not quite as forgiving. Ori's world is stuffed with a colourful collection of adversarial creatures and so you'll spend most, if not quite all, your time fending off their attacks. There's a good assortment of foes, though, each species painted and animated as carefully as Ori themselves. Occasionally you'll be challenged to take on a combat shrine, and it's here you'll really be put through your paces, forced to take on wave after wave of angry enemies. Pop on your sentry, perhaps, and try not to panic - it's always worth beating one in the end.Thankfully, Ori has more than just a sword and bow in their toolbox. Though your sword is technically \"free\" - and by that, I mean you don't use up any mana, or energy, if you swing it - other abilities, such as a powerful spike or a flash of light, gobble it up. Therefore, you must frequently switch up your attack plans depending upon your resources - and what enemies you're taking on, of course.Sadly, combat is hit-or-miss - literally - owing to a litany of technical woes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c49cf82-f664-43c4-a038-bda5da1fc5c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c49cf82-f664-43c4-a038-bda5da1fc5c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6622086-b88b-470e-8ac2-f63d7f29535d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "173155f3af34c2e7bdffb95b33cf82c4a4b41ef53113b512992d129f3c565b0e"}, "3": {"node_id": "0130868a-6188-4850-8caf-401ea3dc0094", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "960176c60c294d39e1161a1844b315664e2c9f599c4d9eb5b176ff286778d9bb"}}, "hash": "4219d975041907dc7088d44914cd3e1a2e39420c720b48baf7f5dd4011c20027", "text": "This review comes to you a little late because prior to a day one patch, autosave didn't work correctly (or at all, sometimes), resulting in the loss of hours of progress - a shame, really, given the autosave feature is a welcomed addition. Even post-patch, however, the game remains littered by slowdowns and frame-rate drops and complete freezes, sometimes for 10+ seconds at a time, on my Xbox One X. Other times I found I couldn't warp - the warp-points were on the map, I just couldn't use them - and once in the middle of a boss fight, the game stopped registering the damage inflicted on my foe. A hard reboot later - something I've learned can fix most issues here - and I defeated the boss on my first attempt.There's also a handful of maddening boss fights and chase sequences, too, both of which increase in length and complexity the closer to the game's climax you get. And while, on the whole, Ori's frequent auto-saving is fair and appreciated, there are a few frustrating sections - and one stealth sequence in particular - that doesn't clearly telegraph what your next steps should be. I've learned the hard way that pushing you back to the start of the encounter each time you're discovered only heightens the resentment, not the peril.Which brings me to my conclusion, I guess, although I'll be honest: I'm conflicted. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is at once both one of the best and most frustrating games I've played this year and whilst its flaws are few, they have an immense and sustained impact on the overall experience. In many ways its satisfying platforming is peerless, but with a myriad of technical issues so substantial, it's difficult to unreservedly recommend it in its current state even with the application of the day one patch. Maybe I've just been unlucky, but a stutter-free screen isn't just a nice-to-have for a platformer like this - it's a necessity.That said? Oh, I loved my time here. I adored the gentle storytelling and the ethereal atmosphere and the melancholy that drapes, like a damp rag, across every inch of Niwen. I loved befriending Twillen and Tokk and Grom and Kwolok and every fuzzy, friendly member of the Moki. I took scores and scores of screenshots - picking them for this review was a nightmare; each one is a masterpiece - and poked my head into every crevice and cranny I could find. When unfettered by freezing, it's an unmitigated pleasure to play, and an even greater joy to behold. If it could just sort out its technical troubles, it just might be one of the best things you play all year.\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nVikki Blake\n\n          Contributor\n        When\u200b \u200bher friends\u200b \u200bwere falling in love with soap stars, Vikki was falling in love with\u200b \u200bvideo games.

I wasn't sure what it was at first, but it was this: I had to walk directly over health and energy orbs to pick them up. Orbs land in all kinds of inconvenient places, scattering into traps and pits and beneath bulbous spider boss asses, and so it felt unnaturally restrictive.

Oops.Other inconsistencies and quirks rankled me throughout Will of the Wisps. It's much bigger and more complex than the five-year-old Ori and the Blind Forest, and, perhaps as a result, it's a messier blend of combat, exploration, and platforming\u2014amazing fun at times, and gorgeous all over, but sloppy.For instance, the new autosave system works fine most of the time, except sometimes when it doesn't save where I expect it to and I'm sent back a frustrating distance. I wound up peeking at the corner of the screen after every tricky bit of platforming to make sure the little rotating save icon appeared. And in a couple of spots, it respawned me in places that were impossible to escape, so it's a good thing I could quit to the menu and load a backup save.The simple combat of Ori and the Blind Forest has been expanded, but it's not much fun. Enemies easily charge through Ori's light sword combos\u2014hits don't interrupt them\u2014and so I had to squint past my swings to gauge when I should leap out of the way. It can be a headache given how small Ori is, and how many bits of waving organic matter in the air and background provide visual interference.When I could, I just cheesed enemies by leaping above them and repeatedly throwing downward strikes, which kept me hovering above their heads. But bugs with impenetrable shells have to be tricked into running into walls and dazing themselves\u2014a tiring old enemy type\u2014and there's also no way to cheese the annoying-ass mosquitoes that spawn until you destroy their nest. Some enemies are just mines that sit on walls and blow up when you get near them, and it's not as if the explosions \u00a0propel you away from the wall or anything\u2014they're just there to be annoying.I beat Will of the Wisps on the normal difficulty mode, which is the way it's \"meant\" to be played according to the menu, but I started it again on easy and definitely prefer playing it the way it's not meant to be played. Fighting the same handful of enemy types for ten-plus hours is not what makes Ori fun, so taking less damage and vaporizing all the crawling things with fewer swings makes everything a little better.You can't always skip combat, but when you can I bet you will, because it's so much more fun to zip through the air. The basic jumping, double-jumping, and dashing is precise and satisfying, just like it was in Ori and the Blind Forest, and the abilities that made that game so fun are back. You can launch glowing energy rope at hooks and sling yourself into the air, chaining grapples like Spider-Man. You can freeze time when you're next to a projectile and then launch it and yourself in opposite directions, bouncing between glowing bullets as if you're ricocheting off of them. There are plenty of places to stop and rest, but you rarely have to give up any speed if you don't want to.With 10 unique areas, there are a ton of special movement abilities and puzzle types, some more successful than others. Diving into sand pits and bouncing around like a pinball before shooting back out like a Dune worm is brilliant. The bits that take after Portal, meanwhile, are a little disappointing. They don't play much with momentum\u2014for the most part, you just go in one magic blue hole and out another\u2014and the most complicated it gets is a tedious puzzle in which you have to methodically guide a projectile between portal pairs.Even the bits that are only so-so feel great to clear, though\u2014like flawlessly running through an ultra-hard Guitar Hero song.\u00a0Aside from that good feeling, the reward for platforming victory doesn't have to be anything more than seeing what's next. I wish I could pluck some of the landscapes out Will of the Wisps and frame them, looping animations included. From the swamps to the mountains and the obligatory water level, they're all stunning\u2014full of light and air and life.The characters and their stories kept me going as well. Like Ori and the Blind Forest, Will of the Wisps is on a mission to pull both delighted and sad awws out of even the most determined grumps\u2014and it does a better job of it. Ori is joined for a brief section by Ku, an owlet who hatches at the end of the last game, and whose curious and sad eyes are just so goddamn cute I almost resent them for manipulating me.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cd8107e-5e5e-48de-a557-72be66a455b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cd8107e-5e5e-48de-a557-72be66a455b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "03e4e310-b25c-44a2-8df5-8a00c9861561", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "962a0b05de66bcc001a7ec25805787dabac4a59b8b129d82e83fc29d77546853"}, "3": {"node_id": "b21b8dcd-fad6-4ed9-b9a7-91f9c4aadb1e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "596a0617151b60e7bb0e2eee948d91bd66905a2f769ddc8b1007cc52397cb049"}}, "hash": "e0f020cae97e3f32df79345ea8c73cc88fb55529c7f636c8fcb8e5c8aee4fce5", "text": "Not quite as cute but also fun are the Moki, creatures that look a bit like meerkats and pop out of the scenery to comment on Ori's journey, offer advice, and ask for help.\u00a0Moki and other characters congregate in a growing village as Ori restores the forest, and little sidequests can be done to help them out. I found growing their little town and taking on their little tasks\u2014like acquiring a hat for one and some soup for another\u2014to be genuinely motivating. It also relaxes the pace a little, which helps counterbalance the frustrating bits.The broader plot is standard forest spirit mysticism stuff\u2014restore the light, restore the balance\u2014and there's another nasty-but-sympathetic owl villain. The end may induce sniffling, but its success will depend on whether or not the boss fights and escape sequences have put you in a sour mood by the time you get to it.The move-or-die escape scenes, in which you have to jump, dash, float, and grapple through collapsing structures while making zero mistakes\u2014there are no checkpoints\u2014are seriously annoying in places. There's a visually-confusing section near the end of one, and I had to replay the whole sequence several times to figure it out, letting myself die so that I could try to observe what I was meant to do. It's satisfying to clear these challenges, but in the same way it would be satisfying to stop punching yourself.There are multi-stage boss fights, too\u2014the kind with a big life bar that you have to chip away at\u2014and they can also be frustrating. The escape sequences at least rely on the unbroken chaining of forward motion that makes Ori feel great, whereas the fights have you leaping around enclosed spaces trying to get sword whacks and ranged attacks in when you can.Take the whole thing at a relaxed pace, though, and you'll collect lots of spirit money with which to upgrade Ori's abilities, reducing incoming damage and increasing outgoing damage. Hunting down energy and life cells throughout the world also makes things easier, so that if a boss is frustrating, at least you can go away and improve the math in your favor. And at least the boss stages are no less beautiful than the rest of the game\u2014and also full of bitter-sweetness.\u00a0I prefer Ori and the Blind Forest for its compactness and simplicity, but Ori and the Will of the Wisps is also worth playing to the end. It trips over its complexity at times, and really doesn't need so much combat, but it's gorgeous, funny, and the triple-jumping could go on forever without getting old.It's inconsistent and sometimes annoying, but ultimately a charming, challenging, heart-string-pulling fable.Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

But that\u2019s the position Microsoft is in right now, and while cute little Ori may not seem an obvious replacement for Master Chief his new game demands to be taken seriously.It\u2019s five years now since Ori And The Blind Forest was first released, which means there\u2019s been a longer gap between these two sequels than most triple-A games. But to all intents and purposes Ori And The Will Of The Wisps is triple-A. Despite the 2D gameplay it has some of the best graphics we\u2019ve seen all generation, with a strikingly beautiful landscape and wonderfully animated characters that are supported by a glorious soundtrack that\u2019s even better than the visuals.At the same time though, Will Of The Wisps is still very obviously a Metroidvania and one that follows the formula of the genre extremely closely. Not only that but it purposefully echoes some of the most memorable moments from the original, most obviously the lengthy opening sequence that introduces you to the ferret-like Ori and his friend Ku \u2013 a newly-hatched owl that proves to be a less than skilled flier, with a disastrous maiden flight leaving both Ori and her stranded in an unknown forest.There\u2019s relatively little dialogue in Will Of The Wisps but the storytelling is excellent nonetheless. The rot, the same malignant growth from the first game, is what drives the main plot, but the heart of the story is the relationship between Ori, Ku, and main villain Shriek. The latter has one of the best backstories of any protagonist in years and yet still most of the story, and certainly the emoting of the characters, is achieved through wordless body language.Will Of The Wisps has all the standard features of a Metroidvania, in that you have a very large open world environment to explore, but your progress is frequently blocked because you lack specific items or abilities that you only gain later in the game.But there are many important differences in how Will Of The Wisps approaches the genre and like the first game there\u2019s more of an emphasis on straight platforming than many of its peers. And while combat was one of the weaker elements of the original, here it\u2019s been beefed up considerably with more moves and weapons, and more interesting enemies.Some many even consider there to be too much emphasis on fighting, especially towards the end of the game, but there\u2019s a good synergy between the fighting moves, the selectable weapons, and the movement-based abilities that have you zipping about the screen almost like a 2D Devil May Cry.Will Of The Wisps also has less backtracking than normal for a Metroidvania, at least in terms of taking the quickest route through the story (which we certainly didn\u2019t do). Backtracking is always controversial, but the game goes further by dispensing with the soul link system from the original, that forced you to manually save your position, in favour of a simple auto-save.That means death has almost no consequence, although fears that this would dumb down the platforming and action are unfounded, as while it\u2019s slightly easier than before, Will Of The Wisps is still extremely challenging by most standards.The hardest parts are usually the boss battles and the escape sequences (which can sometimes be one and the same). The latter requires the most precise platforming in the game, but are still fundamentally similar to the Blind Forest, while the boss battles are considerably more involved and almost always involve giant screen-sized monsters whose tells and weaknesses have to be worked out in an almost Dark Souls like manner.Backtracking is much more evident in the optional side quests, which include a long, Zelda-like trading quest and many story-based missions that end up providing you with new abilities or other boons. However well they\u2019re presented, most of these are just fetch quests but there\u2019s also an interesting hub world village that you can help to upgrade, by bringing back materials to craft new buildings and filling up the area with characters you rescue.The problems with The Will Of The Wisps are essentially the same as with the original, in that as beautifully constructed as everything is, the game isn\u2019t really doing anything new with the Metroidvania concept. The sequel also has the issue that at times it sticks a little too close to its own predecessor, especially in terms of how it tries to pluck your heartstrings during story segments and how many of the opening areas look very similar to those from the first game.Plus, there\u2019s the reason we delayed this review from its launch, where the game was rendered almost unplayable on Xbox One S because of shoddy performance. A day one patch was supposed to fix the problems, but it\u2019s not been entirely successful.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fccc7900-b732-4256-b0db-e1536cce91c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "fccc7900-b732-4256-b0db-e1536cce91c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "b21b8dcd-fad6-4ed9-b9a7-91f9c4aadb1e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "596a0617151b60e7bb0e2eee948d91bd66905a2f769ddc8b1007cc52397cb049"}, "3": {"node_id": "dfc36d95-2f2d-4d0d-8173-53c619e258c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "62a0ef40e3f9b65f6cb4722c5d1ff2486a51233c31cd0ce54703506efb31d412"}}, "hash": "24e733e4293ee71322142de82d61668fd9bca34fb1de8eadf3b9106c8c69352e", "text": "It\u2019s certainly much better now, but even on the Xbox One X there\u2019s still occasional hiccups and glitches that suggest a second patch will be necessary.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader\u2019s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepBut the new combat system and expanded abilities have evolved considerably and the degree to which they allow you to customise your experience, simply by choosing which items to equip, works extremely well. Some you can\u2019t get by without, especially those that involving flying, but even things like the triple jump aren\u2019t strictly necessary if you just want to see the ending.There\u2019s also a wide range of passive abilities, which you can only activate a limited number of at once, and while some seem indispensable at first \u2013 such as the one that lets you automatically stick to walls or those that increase your health or damage output \u2013 you can eventually learn to do without them and instead opt for more interesting alternatives that allow you to explore more of the map.Unoriginal or not Will Of The Wisps is both an improvement on the original and one of the best Metroidvanias of the generation. We\u2019d have qualms about a third game stretching the formula beyond breaking point but while describing this as one of the best games of the year means nothing, given how empty the release schedules have been so far, this would stand out as a great game no matter when, or on what format it, come out.In Short: It may not be able to claim much originality compared to its predecessor, or Metroidvania games in general, but this is still one of the best examples of its craft this generation.Pros: Amazing presentation, with fantastic visuals and soundtrack. Huge range of abilities and optional side quests allows you to play the game however you want.

Clearly, when Hollow Knight schooled everyone on Metroidvanias in 2017, Ori was in the front row with a heavily weathered notebook. Ori and the Will of the Wisps grafts the best parts of modern Metroidvanias like Hollow Knight onto the compelling core established in the first game, resulting in a short but sublime action-platformer that will constantly delight your eyes, ears, and fingertips.\u00a0Release date: March 11, 2020Platforms: Xbox One, PCDeveloper: Moon StudiosPublisher: Xbox Game Studios\u00a0I say it's short, but this is one of those games that feels way longer than it is, not at all because it drags on, but because it's overflowing with ideas and constantly moving onto the next cool thing. Ori and the Will of the Wisps follows the same basic formula as its predecessor - find The Magic McGuffins and unlock new abilities along the way - but its world is livelier and denser, not to mention more dangerous.

Without wishing to spoil, this eventually snowballs into another realm-endangering quest with Ori and the great willow tree, AKA the Mother of Light, at its heart. It's a familiar setup, but the juxtaposition of Ku and Shriek gives Ori and the Will of the Wisps an edge that truly shreds the heartstrings. Between Ku's crippled wing and spunky personality, Shriek's tragic origins, and Ori's ineffable lovability, I was immediately invested. It really is amazing how endearing these characters can be despite having next to no dialogue. I was teary-eyed for the first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes, and there were plenty of gut-punches in the nine hours between.\u00a0Of course, I expected Ori and the Will of the Wisps to be a bittersweet story. What I didn't expect was for it to be the best-feeling 2D game I've ever played, bar none. Ori is a true joy to control. Like the web-swinging in Marvel's Spider-Man or the axe-throwing in God of War, every one of Ori's movements is so fluidly animated and so satisfyingly weighted that the sheer kinetic thrill of it all leaves you hungry for more. I had to actively force myself to stop and appreciate the game's thickly detailed, beautifully layered environments simply because moving through them is such a treat.\u00a0Ori's arsenal of abilities has been greatly expanded in Will of the Wisps. You've got your jump, double-jump, and triple-jump. You can scale vines, cling to walls, and climb on certain surfaces (like Spider-Man, funnily enough). Ori can launch off enemies, projectiles, and hanging lanterns, and even grapple to enemies or designated anchors. You can glide through the air and ride vents upward, dash through the air and along the ground, and dive in and out of water with wonderful flourish. Ori's aerial maneuverability is extraordinary, and it only gets better with the introduction of later abilities, which I won't spoil.\u00a0Ori and the Will of the Wisps reminds me of Super Mario Odyssey in that its movement system is so flexible that it encourages you to experiment with (read: try to break) the game's rules. I was able to access several items and areas well before I was seemingly supposed to by combining abilities in unorthodox ways. And I can't stress enough that this isn't game-breaking; this is brilliant.The moment that sticks out to me came a few hours into the game, shortly after I unlocked the ability to launch off objects. I found a cache of Light Orbs stuck to the ceiling of one area. You use Light Orbs to purchase and upgrade abilities, and I was really close to getting one I wanted. The trouble is, I couldn't reach this particular cache. No matter what I tried, it was just out of reach. I eventually gave up, assuming I was missing a crucial ability, and decided to move on.\u00a0But on my way out, I air-dashed through the lantern I'd been launching off while trying to reach those Light Orbs. This caused it to sway ever so slightly, and that was my light bulb moment. What if I dashed through the lantern to swing it to the left, and then launched off it? That might give me the added height I need to reach the wall near the Light Orbs, and I can just wall jump up to them from there. Launching off lanterns resets your air-dash, so I should still be able to reach the wall if I really stretch my double-jump.\u00a0I have no idea if this is actually how you're supposed to reach those Light Orbs. I could've easily gotten them if I'd had the triple-jump already. But I do know that because I moved that lantern before launching off it, I was able to clear a tiny challenge I'd set for myself, which was hugely satisfying. And that's just one example of the countless ways you can string together abilities in order to forge your own path.\u00a0This kind of improv platforming is baked into the game through side quests and time trials.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f094a0d-7288-4b54-9929-79426ff7a174": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f094a0d-7288-4b54-9929-79426ff7a174", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfc36d95-2f2d-4d0d-8173-53c619e258c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "62a0ef40e3f9b65f6cb4722c5d1ff2486a51233c31cd0ce54703506efb31d412"}, "3": {"node_id": "a004607e-1216-4c83-9ead-07c4d1ff61c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "feb0a95ab0582ee43bcf7684fbcd99d32e74065ce6917e233a045b9736e172d4"}}, "hash": "6eacdb3dadeda60c68283310a421c8f749a6d23312acadc46f836235caa647b7", "text": "This kind of improv platforming is baked into the game through side quests and time trials. Side quests challenge you to collect certain items and bring them to various NPCs, and time trials let you race the ghosts of other players like you would in an actual racing game. The time trials, in particular, were some of my favorite segments, and I wish there were more of them. Even in a pre-release environment, climbing the time trial leaderboards through trial-and-error speedruns was exhilarating, and I was able to apply platforming techniques I picked up in these trials to levels in the main game. I can't wait to see what other players do with these things.\u00a0The time trials are so creative, in fact, that they make the final level feel a little underwhelming by comparison. The finale is a lot like the last level in the first game, for one, and it's also largely built around one ability, which limits its challenges somewhat. It feels weird for the final moments of such an inventive game to push one ability so hard that a lot of others fall by the wayside.\u00a0It's the platforming that really sells Will of the Wisps, but combat's no slouch either. Ori's packing much more than paltry projectiles this time around. You've got a sword for light attacks, a hammer for heavy attacks, and myriad ranged abilities which you can purchase from a monkey who reminds me of The Lion King's Rafiki. My favorite ranged ability was the javelin, partly because you do a cool slow-mo fade-away when you throw one, and partly because the upgraded javelin basically kills the entire screen.\u00a0All of your abilities can be accessed through a weapon wheel of sorts. At any time, you can open the wheel, select an ability, and map it to one of three face buttons. Time stops while you have the wheel open so you can change abilities at any point, which allows for fun and intuitive combos. It also gives you easy access to one of the most important (and most Hollow Knight-like) abilities: your Focus healing. You can spend one mana orb to replenish three health orbs by focusing your energy (read: standing still) for a brief moment, and this helps set the pace for many fights.\u00a0Combat is further enlivened by equippable Spirit Shards, which are scattered throughout the world and sold by another NPC. These can improve your damage output, upgrade your abilities, or make you tankier - whatever you want to spend your limited slots on. You can change your Shards whenever you want, which I appreciate. I generally used a suite of movement-based Shards with one or two damage boosters, and I'd throw on more offensive or defensive tools for boss fights or Combat Shrines. Combat Shrines are to combat what time trials are to platforming - little condensed challenges that put your skills to the test. Again, I wish there were more of these.\u00a0With a full-fledged combat system at its disposal, Ori and The Will of the Wisps is able to make more elaborate bosses. It still has the series' patented escape sequences, wherein you run through a no-checkpoint platforming gauntlet with a boss nipping at your heels, but there are also some traditional fights where you read attacks, exploit openings, and whittle away at a boss' health bar. I don't want to spoil any strategies, so I'll just say that I rather enjoyed these bosses and they were a welcome change of pace. They combine combat and platforming abilities in interesting ways, and actually fighting something gives some story beats more weight.\u00a0If there's a downside to combat, it's that a lot of Spirit Shards and abilities feel uninspired. There's a fair bit of overlap between several abilities, with many coming across as strictly better versions of others, and there were only a handful of Spirit Shards that actually interested me. Halfway through the game, I found myself overburdened with Light Orbs with nothing worthwhile to spend them on, but this is more of a missed opportunity than a problem. The lackluster abilities don't hurt the game, but they don't help it, either. Combat also becomes a bit easy after a while, at least on normal difficulty. If you stay on top of collecting health orbs (I reached 95% completion, to give you an idea), you can brute force a lot of encounters without bothering to memorize attack patterns. I'll almost definitely replay Will of the Wisps on hard mode, and I'd recommend the same to players looking for a challenge.\u00a0There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I adore Ori and The Will of the Wisps.

Developer Moon Studios tugs\u00a0at the player\u2019s emotions whenever possible, both through a beautifully penned story that sees Ori racing to rescue a friend, and also nail-biting gameplay that demands precision and patience every step of the way. Will of the Wisps is more carefully designed than Ori and the Blind Forest, dazzling with the basics and upping the tension frequently through explosive setpiece moments.This is not a game for the faint of heart \u2013 it\u2019s as challenging as it is clever. Even if you figure out a jumping pattern required to solve an environmental puzzle, you need to be able to make those leaps, which are often ridiculously hard. Ori needs to jump, double jump, roll, glide, and latch onto objects \u2013 and sometimes he does all of those things in a single elaborate maneuver. The movement chains you are often pushed to meld are intense, but the payoff is well worth the effort.Moon Studios doesn\u2019t back down from the original\u2019s difficulty, and though you may die over and over, Will of the Wisps is a more approachable experience thanks to a new checkpoint system. Instead of sacrificing valuable energy to create save points, you now have more forgiving checkpoints that are activated when you reach certain spots. The checkpoints are everywhere, and make sense for each challenge area. If you reach a ledge free of threats,\u00a0it\u2019s likely a checkpoint. Just getting to some of them can be a stressful (and satisfying) workout.The only area where Will of the Wisps doesn\u2019t save progress is during Ori's escapes. Yes, these chaotic sequences are back; Ori must dash over tumbling terrain as an avalanche roars toward her, and dart in and out of sand to stay ahead of a tunneling worm. These tests of skill require split-second thinking and perfect movement. They make you hold your breath and exhale profanity, but are easy to read in terms of navigation and are not nearly as tough as they were in Blind Forest. They\u2019re still difficult, but you should be able to get through them after a few tries.While the story focuses on Ori trying to locate a little owlet named Ku, the game is mostly a pursuit of power. The opening section is fairly guided, but then it opens up and lets players figure things out on their own. A journey into the watery Luma Pools to the east may lead to little progress being made until you first gain a power from the north, yet you don\u2019t know it\u2019s there or what it may be. You just need to keep exploring, and pay attention to the environments for areas that you think you can eventually reach. Using Ori\u2019s moveset to navigate these spaces is a blast \u2013 I never tired of it and I love how it expands.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c4cdd98-c90a-4bc4-ab37-fecdc145a02e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c4cdd98-c90a-4bc4-ab37-fecdc145a02e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "a004607e-1216-4c83-9ead-07c4d1ff61c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "feb0a95ab0582ee43bcf7684fbcd99d32e74065ce6917e233a045b9736e172d4"}, "3": {"node_id": "1472a534-acf1-48a9-bbad-0b6b3112fc0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6742e4724787ca18977478806ef40ddcbaceba266ab39baeb4cacac1d309fe07"}}, "hash": "c561de37488539d31590731fd8d0b79f322fd72aea7c7db64f2f0394a5d929cf", "text": "The map does a fantastic job of tracking progress and visually showing you areas that haven\u2019t fully cleared out yet. Even if you're stumped, the gray areas on the map serve as waypoints that will likely hold an answer.The entire forest delivers the sensation that you are exploring one giant, sprawling dungeon, even though each area is visually distinct. The powers Ori unearths are varied and fun to use, including a surprising number of abilities dedicated to combat, which plays a larger role across the entire game, and is a welcome addition.The arsenal of attacks players find allow Ori to be up close and personal with energy sword strikes and an aura that deals damage, or to be more elusive and use ranged attacks like a boomerang or sentry. The abilities can be switched with ease on the fly through a wheel and are all powerful in their own right. Ori is a tiny little critter, yet ends up looking like a superhero with an impressive array of attacks. Again, this is the pursuit of power paying dividends. Some combat encounters are more intense and interesting than others, and the same can be said of the platforming (a few sequences lack the creative spark found throughout most of the game), but most of the content hits hard.\u00a0Players can also invest spirit shards into enhancing these attacks, as well as Ori\u2019s base statistics, like taking 25 percent less damage or being able to shoot projectiles faster. The shards can also enhance abilities, such as a jump doubling as a ram attack, and the Spirit Arc splitting into three shots. All of these light RPG systems are awesome, as they just push players to explore more and battle every enemy, as most drop shards. Each purchase ends up feeling significant as it can make encounters and traversal easier.They also help with bosses, towering creatures that have plenty of health and are incredibly aggressive. These fights deliver frantic fun and push players to wait for openings to attack. I took on a spider boss way too early in my playthrough, and barely took any health off of it, but then returned later with a more powerful arsenal and more health canisters and took it down on my first attempt.That\u2019s part of what makes the Will of the Wisps such a fascinating game. I could have taken on that spider 100 times and eventually beaten it early on, but I instead backed away and came back when I was better suited for the fight. Whenever I hit a part that felt too hard, I came back later with something that served as a solution. Fast travel is handled nicely, but I would often hoof it to most places, as there are numerous side quests along the way (like finding lost trinkets). Helping others in need, Ori\u2019s efforts help build up a small village, which serves as a hub for upgrades and other various functions. There\u2019s plenty of side content that is enjoyable to explore.The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with Will of the Wisps, delivering an experience that doesn\u2019t have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

The optimized version of the game hits an ultra-smooth 60-120 frames per second on both next-gen consoles at varying resolutions. It's a huge comeback for a game that was initially subject to wonky technical issues. In the next generation, Ori sheds its graphical hangups and becomes more impressive for it.Both consoles have frame rate-prioritizing \"performance\" and visually minded \"fidelity\" modes, but neither one feels like a compromise. On the Series S, you get to choose between 1080p with HDR at 120fps, or an upscaled 4K at 60fps. On the Series X, you can choose to play the game in 4K with HDR at a performance-focused 120fps, or goose the graphics in a supersampled 6K resolution, running at 60fps with HDR.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1472a534-acf1-48a9-bbad-0b6b3112fc0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1472a534-acf1-48a9-bbad-0b6b3112fc0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c4cdd98-c90a-4bc4-ab37-fecdc145a02e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c561de37488539d31590731fd8d0b79f322fd72aea7c7db64f2f0394a5d929cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b1b8d3d-7bb2-4c6b-aaf7-c3ccc4b10cd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e728cdfa15d25b2d3f6dd167dca93cabbfe613970fc6eff7f6a44717f9784dfa"}}, "hash": "6742e4724787ca18977478806ef40ddcbaceba266ab39baeb4cacac1d309fe07", "text": "Regardless of your settings, Will of the Wisps also benefits from enhanced load times and improved audio fidelity.Supersampling, for anyone perplexed by the idea of playing an Xbox One-era game in 6K, processes an image at a higher resolution, then compresses it down to your TV or monitor's resolution. You know how a screenshot gets blurry when you make it ten times larger? It's kind of like the opposite of that\u2026 But happening in real-time because it's a video game and not a static image. The thing you need to know is, when using 6K mode in Will of the Wisps, you aren't actually playing in 6K, but what you are playing does get a nice visual boost over the standard 4K setting.In anecdotal, eyeball-based terms, the colorful forests of Ori's opening hours look better in the 6K mode. Environmental elements like flowers hanging off walls and thorny spikes stick out more sharply against the background. These are small enough differences that you probably won't notice them during an intense platforming challenge. If you stop and look around, though, you'll appreciate what you see. Will of the Wisps still looks incredible in 4K; it's colorful, vibrant, and sharp. If you want to wring the absolute best visuals out of the Series X--or if, like me, you do not have a TV or monitor capable of rendering 4K and HDR at 120fps--6K is a nice little high-fidelity nudge.Speaking of which, let's talk about performance. When it first launched, Will of the Wisps suffered from some technical setbacks, including stutters and screen tearing due to inconsistent frame rates. Not only are those issues gone now, but the game now sets a high bar for technical performance. Its animation is silky smooth at 60 frames per second. In the first four hours, I didn't see a single, momentary hitch. As I just noted above, I tested the 6K/60Hz mode but also ran the 4K/120Hz performance mode on a TV maxing out at 60Hz, so I cannot attest to how it fares when pushed in performance mode.Beyond that, Ori and the Will of the Wisps remains an incredible action-platformer. As Steve Watts explained in GameSpot's original review earlier this year, \"While Ori is ostensibly a metroidvania, Will of the Wisps is less focused on exploration and backtracking than is typical for the genre. Your objectives are usually clear, straight lines, and shortcuts littered throughout the environments get you back to the main path quickly.\" Will of the Wisps streamlines the exploration- and puzzle-heavy gameplay into something more straightforward. It retains the original's tight, graceful platforming and brings the same precision to its expanded combat systems. \"Around the mid-game I realized I had become adept at stringing together platforming and combat skills,\" Watts said, \"air-dashing and bounding between threats with balletic rhythm and barely touching the ground until the screen had been cleared.\"Will of the Wisps was always an impressive visual showpiece, despite the technical flaws that initially held it back. It's more straightforward, combat-heavy flow may still put off die-hard fans of the original Ori, but there's that's a small nitpick for a game that retains its identity while finding a new flow. Most importantly for the Series X and S upgrades, next-gen hardware turns one of Will of the Wisps' original weaknesses into a point of pride, and that's worth celebrating.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:A beautiful game gets a smart sequel[Editor\u2019s note: We held off on releasing this review due to severe technical issues with the pre-release version of the game.

The purified water below turned a deep, inviting, clear blue.  Will of the Wisps\u2019 world is constantly in motion. Leaves dance in the wind, bob beneath rain, and light up as Ori\u2019s luminous body passes by. Ori and the Will of the Wisps\u2019 environments betray their life with constant, often slight, movement; rising and falling as if a giant pair of lungs were inhaling and exhaling just beneath the level\u2019s surface. But it\u2019s not all about how the game looks, especially when it plays this well. Will of the Wisps\u2019 story, like its art style, picks up where Blind Forest left off. In the first game, the titular cat-like spirit set off to save the forest from corruption. The encroaching darkness had killed his mother, Naru, and a newly orphaned Ori began a quest to bring his home back to life. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a spoiler to say he succeeded. \n    Related\n  Ori is now living with his makeshift family as Will of the Wisps begins, raising an owl hatchling that had been left behind by Kuro, a hulking bird that antagonized Ori for much of the last game. Life is good in the quiet forest, in other words. But, the hatchling, with one small wing, is struggling to learn to fly. Ori offers the owl Kuro\u2019s feather to help, fastening it to their wing. This is what allowed Ori to fly in the first game, after all. Ori and the hatchling take off on a test flight \u2014 beautifully portrayed in a stunning cinematic \u2014 but hey are blown off course by a violent storm, caused by the same corruption that Ori had defeated in his own land. That darkness still exists elsewhere, it seems, so Ori\u2019s work is not yet done. The pair are separated in the chaos and Ori sets out to find the hatchling, and once again return the forest to its natural state of peace and beauty. It\u2019s a clever set-up, designed to bring Ori to an unfamiliar place, with new power-ups to unlock, new secrets to uncover and a new world to save. Blind Forest kept its characters mostly silent, allowing snippets of narration \u2014 delivered in the booming voice of the Spirit Tree \u2014 to drive the story. Moon Studios keeps that approach here, but introduces a memorable cast of characters to help Ori along the way. I was especially fond of the mapmaker, Lupo, who said that he had ruined a perfectly fine piece of parchment by taking the name of Inkwater Marsh too literally. Plenty of other NPCs are waiting to talk with you in the game\u2019s hubworld, Wellspring Glade. Some are just there to chat, like the lemur-like Moki, who approach Ori in groups, finishing each other\u2019s sentences. Others provide functionality, like Twilen, the opportunistic merchant who sells Ori shards, equippable stones that provide our hero with active skills or passive buffs. You won\u2019t need to interact much with Wellspring Glade\u2019s inhabitants to finish the story, but you\u2019ll unearth a treasure trove of side quests and secrets by dedicating time to the village. The more grounded, yet still clever, conversations with these new characters adds an extra layer of connection to the game\u2019s world. I spent the bulk of the game exploring this new area of the game\u2019s world, and the most important power-ups are tied to that exploration. I locate a spirit tree from which Ori can absorb a new ability about halfway through each new area, constantly changing how I can interact with the world, and adding to the places I can visit. I gain the ability to boost through water at one point, enabling me to jet past falling blocks that previously killed me In the sandy Windswept Wastes, I earned a move that let me travel through walls of sand. Each environment I uncover feels unique, and I love the way new abilities tie into the world around me. I sometimes find the glowing orbs that work as the game\u2019s currency, which I can then take back to the village to buy optional skills.  These skills are important for expanding your options in combat, which plays a larger role in Will of the Wisps than it did last time around.

The options at my disposal have been significantly expanded this time around. I can perform a lock-on bash through an enemy, smash them over the head with a hammer, dash, double jump, hit an opponent with a fireball, etc, all without ever touching the ground. Combat feeds into movement and movement feeds into combat; it\u2019s hard to separate the two when discussing how the game feels to play. This works well, but it\u2019s unfortunate that, to play to this strength, Will of the Wisps favors traditional boss fights instead of the lengthy, exhilarating platforming sections from Blind Forest. It feels like a small step backward in a game that\u2019s so inventive in other areas.  Will of the Wisps loses a bit of Blind Forest\u2019s clear identity by adding so many new systems. Moon Studios\u2019 first game zeroed in on precise platforming and focused on executing that idea nearly perfectly. But this follow-up has so much more: acrobatic jumps, robust combat, multiple upgrade systems and plenty of side quests. Each aspect of the game is done well, but I sometimes missed the focused, elegant design of the first game. It doesn\u2019t help that the game\u2019s performance often feels like it\u2019s creaking under the weight of all that content. In its pre-release state, Ori and the Will of the Wisps had persistent, crippling technical issues when played on Xbox One S. Those issues impacted the game to such a degree that we didn\u2019t feel comfortable reviewing it until the day-one patch arrived. The good news is that, by and large, those issues are no longer present. Last night, as I replayed the hours that I lost while playing the bugger, pre-release game, I no longer lost my saved games. There is  still some occasional dips in framerate, and the hitches struck at unusual times \u2014 not during a frantic boss fight, but, rather, during slower exploration segments out in the world. There are other, small issues with load times, but the game is now significantly more playable than the version I had originally tried to review. Ori and the Will of the Wisps offers a gorgeous world to explore and a varied, creative series of abilities and tasks that guide my exploration and help me see more of this wonderful place. It expands my options in combat and offers me more to do, and mostly benefits from that added complexity, while losing some of its focus in the process. Overall, however, it\u2019s a worthy trade off.  Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a vibrant platformer, and I\u2019m so happy the technical issues from the pre-release version continue to be worked out so more people can enjoy its vision.

Emails accompanying the download code warned of multiple known issues and heralded the coming of a \u201cday one\u201d patch that would fix them all. The emails suggested playing on the more powerful Xbox One X instead of the Xbox One S, as it was still being optimized. Then they suggested playing on PC instead of Xbox, as the PC version was a more stable build. None of this mattered. I played both versions and experienced many problems.

The frame rate no longer drops to a crawl immediately after using the teleportation mechanic. I can exit to the main menu now, something I couldn\u2019t do previously on the Xbox One. It still hitches briefly when dropping out of the pause menu on the console, but the more serious glitches and bugs seem to have been cleared up. Thank goodness. It would have sucked to recommend a game filled with annoying bugs\u2014and yet, I totally would have, based on my 15 hours with Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Picking up more or less where Blind Forest left off, Ori and the Will of the Wisps opens with the birth of Ku, the last surviving offspring of the previous game\u2019s angry-owl boss Kuru. Welcomed with open arms into the adopted family of shimmering white forest spirit Ori, Ku grows and flourishes, showered with affection, smothered with hugs, and endeared to the audience. At least, until it comes time to fly. When the baby bird\u2019s efforts are hindered by an underdeveloped wing, Ori patches Ku\u2019s weak limb with Kuro\u2019s feather (an item from the first game), and the pair launch into an inspiring flight sequence that only feels slightly lifted from How to Train Your Dragon.Ori and Ku follow a group of birds across the ocean to a new land and directly into a powerful thunderstorm, the fury of which sends the pair plummeting to the ground in different directions. Lost and alone, Ori searches for Ku, stumbling into a quest to restore light and hope to this new land. Long story short, game makes us love baby owl, game takes baby owl away, must find baby owl. Other owl-related things happen. If nothing else, between the two Ori games the people of Moon Studios have proven themselves as masters of making us cry about owls. Fortunately, Moon Studios excels at more than just strigiform-inspired sadness. It also shines at making players feel comfortable performing perilous platforming maneuvers. Ori\u2019s movement controls are incredibly intuitive, making seemingly impossible jumps involving complex combinations of dashing, grappling, leaping, and vaulting feel as natural as taking a walk down the street. It helps that the world is expertly engineered to be a playground for Ori\u2019s various traversing talents. Though this new area of the world of Nibel looks like an extensive hand-painted mural, colorful and chaotic, every inch of the sprawling map is designed with movement in mind. If a spot seems unreachable, Ori probably hasn\u2019t acquired the proper power to get there yet. In shades of Metroid, Ori gains new skills as they hunt for their owl friend and, later, the titular wisps, opening up areas that were previously off limits. Not only are abilities like dashing, grappling, and burrowing through sand essential for Ori to complete their quest, they are also the key to uncovering Nibel\u2019s secret areas, which are filled with additional challenges, side quests, and power-ups.Normally, my instinct is to skip collectible extras while playing a game for review, but Ori and the Will of the Wisps makes movement and exploring so gratifying that uncovering secrets is just as compelling as following the narrative. I could have finished much faster than the 15 hours it took (not counting the bits I had to do over due to bugs), but I kept getting sidetracked and loving it. The side characters and their accompanying side quests certainly didn\u2019t help keep me on course. Unlike Blind Forest, a more lonely, contemplative sort of platforming adventure, Will of the Wisps\u2019 world is populated by talkative creatures eager to aid Ori on their quest. The Moki are adorable cat-monkeys with a fondness for soup and an endearing tendency to let bigger, stronger creatures do all the work. A stork-like character with long legs named Tokk hangs out in the hub world, selling special attack abilities for spirit currency. Near him is Grom, a dwarf who collects ore to add new decorations and dwellings to the area. There\u2019s also a mysterious wizard in a cave who sells and upgrades spirit shards, special items with the ability to influence the way the game plays, modifying stats and making Ori more powerful. \"Ori and the Blind Forest is the best. This is better than that.\"I promised I wouldn't say \"Metroidvania.\" More character, more powers, more wondrous movement, more Ori, more owls. Getting to play it early.

My favorite characters are the ancient animals who serve as Ori\u2019s guides, and sometimes obstacles, on their journey. These massive, dazzling beasts make Ori feel very small, which in turn makes Ori\u2019s accomplishments even more impressive. They\u2019re also an excellent showcase for Will of the Wisps\u2019 unique, ethereal art style. Will of the Wisps is bigger than Blind Forest in almost every way. The world is bigger. The cast is bigger. The list of abilities and items Ori can collect is bigger. With the addition of more speaking characters, the emotional moments are bigger. The frogs? Bigger. Bears? Same.In the case of Ori and the Will of the Wisps, bigger is better\u2014mostly. The larger scope means a few things get lost along the way. It\u2019s easy to miss useful skills (like water-breathing), and some abilities are under-explained. I did not know that the bash skill could break through certain walls until my incredibly helpful coworker and fellow player Ari Notis mentioned it as I was writing this review. Likewise, Ari didn\u2019t realize that combat shrines, special areas that challenge players with waves of enemies, would reward him with new slots for power-enhancing shards. Though the combat has been greatly enhanced, with many new baddie-bashing abilities, Ori\u2019s still a series that\u2019s more about exploring than battling, so the urge to skip optional battles is strong. Don\u2019t!With Will of the Wisps, the Ori series\u2019 focus has widened. While some of the details have blurred in the process, the result is a game that\u2019s much more expansive while even more magical and heart-wrenching than the original. That\u2019s coming from someone who just spent 15 hours with a bug-riddled early review copy. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s even better fixed. Ori and the Will of the Wisps, out tomorrow for Xbox One and PC, is a meditative, poetic, beautiful It\u2019s weird seeing the Microsoft Studios logo appear on the screen as I load a game on a Nintendo\u2026Ori and the Blind Forest is a pretty good video game! But we're not here today to talk about the\u2026\nUSgamer, The best of the USgamer team\u2019s content has been archived on VG247.\nGame Revolution, \nBy\n\nMichael Leri \nEven though Metroidvania games are quite prevalent nowadays, Ori and the Blind Forest was still among the best when it came out in 2015. It had the requisite ability progression and litany of hidden collectibles, but its demanding platforming, vibrant art style, and tear-jerker of a story put it in the upper echelon of the packed genre. Because of that, ORI AND THE WILL OF THE WISPS has a high bar to leap over and even though it doesn\u2019t clear said bar, it still lands with a decent amount of grace.Will of the Wisps is still fundamentally a challenging platformer with an expanding arsenal of new moves like any true Metroidvania. You\u2019ll start out merely double jumping over gaps before graduating to gliding over hazards while also air dashing, bouncing off projectiles, and grappling to certain points all in succession with only a tiny margin of error. It\u2019s quite a ramp up that pushes back throughout its dozen hours, but grows along with you in a satisfying way. New side missions not only add some character to the world, but they also provide even more upgrades that further the progression even more and reward your curiosity and skill.As you learn more and improve, the game gets more devious or cooks up new hazards and this constant pressure means that the gameplay doesn\u2019t get repetitive. Responsive controls also ensure that you make these jumps and can survive these gauntlets if you have the reflexes. There may be the occasional weird physics bug that flings a platform out of reach and a few ledges with some odd, progress-stopping lips or curves, but Will of the Wisps is a fluid platformer that relies on its slick controls and pacing to create levels full of gratifying jumping puzzles that test you from beginning to end.ALSO:\u00a0Resident Evil 3 Remake Review | Seeing S.T.A.R.S.The notorious escape sequences are emblematic of this and are still hard but not as ridiculously punishing as they were in the last title.

Fighting was very much an afterthought in Ori and the Blind Forest as the spark that attacked for you was as distant as it was boring. Will of the Wisps is much more physical and seems to have borrowed elements from Dead Cells and Hollow Knight with its flashier melee combat system.But Will of the Wisps is only a surface-level imitation, failing to grasp at what truly makes those combat systems so engrossing. Animation canceling is basically non-existent as once you attack, you\u2019re committed to the swing until it finishes. When done correctly, it can make attacks feel more devastating as there is a proper amount of risk and reward attached. But here, it limits how you can move and makes combat sluggish as a result as it consistently robs control from you.Dodging is even worse as there are essentially zero (or very few) invulnerability frames. This makes your dash useless in many scenarios since you\u2019ll often get clipped by an attack anyway, despite your evasive maneuver. Nimble and brutal enemies will punish a poor roll and the problem gets exponentially worse when roll right into them as you instantly take damage. It\u2019s an annoying, nagging issue that most plainly points out why lacking i-frames is such a huge deal breaker.This pair of problems coalesce into a lackluster combat system with almost none of the beauty of its platforming half. It\u2019s clunky and not nearly as refined as the games it\u2019s most clearly aping. Dead Cells, through its animation canceling and excellent dodge move, is a masterclass example of the benefits a polished fighting system that can elevate an entire game to classic status. Will of the Wisps, through misunderstanding those tenets, is a great example of how a game can pantomime its influences yet fail by skipping over the vital details.Bosses make these shortcomings evident as it becomes clear that they often demand a level of combat acuity the game is ill-equipped to support. Each finds its own special way to point out the holes in the fighting mechanics before blowing them wide open with each and every cheap death. Many of them can be battles of attrition since you can heal, but they\u2019re still painful slogs that are worse than any of the diabolical escapes from the first game.At least the bosses animate well and look absolutely incredible, but that\u2019s not exclusive to those climactic battles. Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a stunningly gorgeous game at every turn. Environments are remarkably detailed and decorated with a whole swath of vibrant colors that extend all the way out to its awe-inspiring vistas that linger in the background. There\u2019s a certain variety and richness to the palette that is the result of some exceptional art direction.It looks as spectacular in motion, too. From its secondary characters to its aforementioned bosses, the animation is absolutely marvelous and is most apparent in the protagonist. Ori\u2019s acrobatic moves squash and stretch and reflect the fluidity of the controls during gameplay, but also deftly convey emotion during the mostly silent cutscenes. Properly expressing action and the atmosphere through animation evokes a Disney-esque feel to the whole game, which is also backed up by its phenomenal soundtrack that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place in an animated film from that mouse-eared company.Ori and the Blind Forest\u2018s story drew comparisons to some Pixar movies and Will of the Wisps tries to strike a nearly identical tone with its narrative. Given these similarities, it still has the charming, wholesome nature that is directly carried over from its predecessor. It\u2019s inoffensive, doesn\u2019t interrupt the gameplay, and is still heartwarming in spots, but some of the parts are almost directly lifted from that effective first game. A small handful of surprises doesn\u2019t override the fact that the story almost directly copies what came before and is more forgettable as a result, especially given the weak inciting incident.The story helps point out how Ori and the Will of the Wisps is sort of a will o\u2019 the wisp itself. It had almost an unattainable goal of trying to top the first entry that was a surprisingly tough yet satisfying platformer with a ton of heart. Will of the Wisps doesn\u2019t jump as high as Ori and the Blind Forest and falls in a few extra pits yet it is still a worthy enough successor. Comparisons between the two are not always favorable to the sequel, especially considering how it repeats some of the same beats.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "687a491a-5e47-4690-87d8-ce33334555fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "687a491a-5e47-4690-87d8-ce33334555fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ce69e41-7093-4dc8-b4b0-196846ef8573", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "49a1405f3dbd90ac656386612be5f5449bfc1ef5662d50748ff99c9107acc886"}, "3": {"node_id": "3227cff7-3ee0-47a3-a4df-67c512777853", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d9ad1adaaf5aca775cf2b97bfc6dfb8cdef94e8253d9f01fd3c95b224d34dd30"}}, "hash": "3efb0e76d5f331e4c9fc083da84ffb010692164d6ef200f97270867972e3886a", "text": "But that same familiarity is also what gives Will of the Wisps\u00a0its vivid art style and well-paced, difficult platforming that make both titles such noteworthy entries in the crowded Metroidvania genre.GameRevolution reviewed Ori and the Will of the Wisps on PC with a copy provided by the publisher.8Michael Leri is Evolve's senior gaming editor.

It\u2019s a masterpiece.And five years later, nearly to the day, they\u2019ve done it again.Ori and the Will of the Wisps\u00a0(PC [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: Moon StudiosPublisher: Xbox Game StudiosReleased: March 11, 2020MSRP: $29.99The first thing you should know about the sequel is that Moon Studios pretty much dials everything up. Environments no longer contain just shades of beauty, but show a sort of emotional growth for the studio as a whole. Will of the Wisps\u00a0is more stylized, without fear of delving into more harrowing territory to combat that ever-encroaching idyllic bliss that Ori\u00a0so effortlessly exhumes.I mean\u2026just look at any screens for it.The minimalist tear-jearker of a story is also back, and partly focuses on the relationship between Ori and his owl-friend Ku: an owl that descended from a creature in the first game. This manifests itself both narratively and mechanically, in a way that emphasizes their friendship in a meaningful way (a joyride, just after Ku learns to fly, leads them to a new region, the basis for the sequel). Moon really knows how to hit those emotional high notes, and when that score kicks in: oh man! There\u2019s also a bit more drama and a few heavier themes to boot, which I won\u2019t spoil here.To its credit, Will of the Wisps\u00a0immediately tries to differentiate itself from its predecessor in that Ori is no longer mashing buttons to shoot out short-range projectiles. Instead, he\u2019s stripped of his powers, Metroid\u00a0style, and is initially forced to bust up enemies with a melee torch: which quickly becomes a much more elegant light sword. As a result, the sequel\u2019s combat feels a little more deliberate, and at times, tougher.A lack of a quick dash at the start puts a damper on combat as you\u2019re manually maneuvering around attacks instead of comboing in escapes, but Ori\u00a0was never really a frame-perfect action game. Once you become more agile things heat up, but not until that point. Still, it\u2019s a thrill to hit that perfect ability window right before an enemy comes at you, then dodge. That sort of drama wasn\u2019t as electric in the original and you can clearly see evolution with the sequel.Being more keyed into the mechanical aspects of the Ori\u00a0series extends to the spirit shard system: where players can select up to three abilities (at first; you earn more slots) to augment the latent upgrades (like double jump) Ori acquires during his travels. Instead of just following a skill tree you\u2019ll eventually complete, the way you play Ori is likely going to be different than the way someone else plays him. Above all, it helps age subsequent playthroughs, and dual-purpose key abilities (like the bow and arrow, which triggers puzzles and roughs up enemies) also nudge players to use skills throughout the game, not just for their niche in-level purpose.The world feels bigger, with more questgivers, vendors and more outlets to spend currency: including a really cute village-building minigame. The map is more helpful and highlights nearly everything you need from the get-go to encourage exploration. If you liked the dramatic chase sequences from the original they\u2019re back: with new challenges in tow and more garish creatures to run from. These still work incredibly well and lead to some of the best moments in the game.They will lead to plenty of deaths, however.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3227cff7-3ee0-47a3-a4df-67c512777853": {"__data__": {"id_": "3227cff7-3ee0-47a3-a4df-67c512777853", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "687a491a-5e47-4690-87d8-ce33334555fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3efb0e76d5f331e4c9fc083da84ffb010692164d6ef200f97270867972e3886a"}, "3": {"node_id": "a6e5cd1d-a7dc-4063-bcd4-c63a71700a57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aac5e699fa9b8ed783388d6fc93349b609ba813cd32e728fe4276a703d40fc79"}}, "hash": "d9ad1adaaf5aca775cf2b97bfc6dfb8cdef94e8253d9f01fd3c95b224d34dd30", "text": "The whole \u201csave anywhere\u201d gimmick is also mostly gone, replaced with generous checkpoints. It\u2019s somehow more forgiving and more demanding, all at once: but with the former favoring exploration, Ori\u2018s core strength, it comes out as a net positive. The ability to skip cutscenes by default in 2020, the era of speedrunning, is a no-brainer.So here\u2019s the bad news: I played both versions of the game, and encountered framerate issues on my Xbox One X (my PC tests, which are indicative of this review, were cleaner), but it\u2019s a weird situation. Upon first booting up the game I noticed slowdown throughout, as well as framerate drops in a few major areas. After re-booting my machine almost all of that cleared up throughout the rest of my subsequent playthroughs, so it remains to be seen if it\u2019s a temporary bug that will pop up for some people.While the framerate stabilized, I did still encounter some stuttering (mostly when opening up the map) as well as a missing animation in the final dungeon. None of these issues were game-breaking or impacted my experience in a major way. Moon Studios says there\u2019s a day-one patch coming, so hopefully it\u2019ll fix any mystery problems.With the need to go bigger, Ori and the Will of the Wisps\u00a0loses some of the simplicity and innocence of the original game, but it steps up in turn with bite and refinement. It\u2019s the perfect companion to Ori and the Blind Forest, and is an early defining moment of the decade to come.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

Our review.Ori and the Blind Forest was a game that surprised me upon release with a cool art style and its well-paced platformer action. At the time, I was not actively looking for the type of experience it offered but found myself very happy that it crossed my path. In the years since its release, the competition elevated the genre to unforeseen heights, particularly in the case of Hollow Knight and Dead Cells. Developer Moon Studios is back to kick off a new decade with its second attempt at the genre in the form of Ori and the Will of the Wisps. Expanding or improving on virtually all parts of the original game, Will of the Wisps marries a peerless visual presentation with immensely improved combat and exploration mechanics, offering a journey that would be supreme if not for technical issues.Protagonist Ori is a spawn of the Spirit Tree, the guardian of the forest of Nibel, which is the backdrop of the events in the first game. Looking like a weird mix between a sugar glider and a rat-rabbit-cat, Ori glows with a faint blue hue that matches that of the Spirit Tree. Following the events at the opening of the original game, Ori is adopted by this white-faced ape thing by the name of Naru. Circumstances see the pair separated and eventually reunited when the main antagonist, an owl by the name of Kuro, sacrifices herself in an act of love.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6e5cd1d-a7dc-4063-bcd4-c63a71700a57": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6e5cd1d-a7dc-4063-bcd4-c63a71700a57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "3227cff7-3ee0-47a3-a4df-67c512777853", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d9ad1adaaf5aca775cf2b97bfc6dfb8cdef94e8253d9f01fd3c95b224d34dd30"}, "3": {"node_id": "da6213ac-8fc6-4987-8f51-6b80186bf3c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b049fca3122f860e72674769b40feaac25adccaf4e71ef5e027b2a919f2b76a4"}}, "hash": "aac5e699fa9b8ed783388d6fc93349b609ba813cd32e728fe4276a703d40fc79", "text": "This sacrifice restores order to the forest, which had been in danger of becoming burnt toast during the game. Kuro left behind an unhatched egg that Naru and Ori take in as their own.Will of the Wisps opens with a beautiful montage that shows Ori and Ku, the owlet hatched from Kuro\u2019s egg, being raised in your typical four-occupant family, headed by Naru and Gumo, a former enemy turned friend by Ori\u2019s kindness. Ku was born with a gimped right arm and is unable to fly, leading to some sad times, especially when combined with its confusion over why it finds itself being raised by two folks who are not owls. Ori remembers that Kuro left a single feather behind and gives it to Ku. This feather gets stapled onto Ku by Gumo and then Ori and Ku take off into the skies, allowing the owlet to get a taste of freedom and a sense of place in the world.\u00a0During this flight, the duo finds themselves in the middle of a bad storm that decouples the feather from Ku and sends the pair into a tailspin, splitting them apart in a strange, swampy land known as Inkwater marsh. Ori wakes up from the fall-induced coma they were in and sets out to find Ku. Avoiding spoilers, the journey takes place across a wide variety of locations, with the forest of Nibel only being seen for a very small portion of the game. The action takes Ori through the swamps, into a desert area, canvassing ice, spelunking underground, and more. With the narrative being an integral component of the action, the less known going into the game, the better.Fans of the metroidvania genre will have a strong idea of how Ori and the Will of the Wisps works. A large world is there for the exploring, with big chunks of it being inaccessible to the player until certain items or abilities are discovered or earned. What may have been previously out of reach to players should the ability to double jump, glide, or flip switches be granted during the course of the journey. There are special wells that can be found during play that allow for life and energy to be recovered, progress to be saved, and that facilitate fast travel between major areas of the game world.\u00a0NPCs will be littered throughout the journey that can offer clues on the location of special side missions, speed trials, or other points of interest. These things will be marked on the game\u2019s map for easy reference. Each main area also has an NPC you can find that will sell you a map, much like what was seen in Hollow Knight. NPCs can also sell Spirit Shards and upgrades to the shards.\u00a0Spirit Shards are items that grant either passive or active abilities to Ori such as the ability to grab walls like Spider-Man, deflect a percentage of damage taken in combat, or enhance offensive prowess. Initially, only three of these Spirit Shards can be active at once, but additional Shard slots can be found or earned. These Shards can be swapped in and out of action at any time.In addition to a basic energy sword, Ori and the Will of the Wisps offers a serious expansion of the combat system from the first game. New weapons like bows and whips are now on the menu, allowing players different ways to dispose of the odd, menacing creatures that litter Ori\u2019s path. These weapons and other abilities are mapped to the three upper face buttons on the controller and, like the Spirit Shards, can be adjusted quickly within the game\u2019s menus.The enemy encounters are a welcome step up from Ori and the Blind Forest and add depth to the journey. In my opinion, the combat falls a bit short of what was delivered in Hollow Knight and a fair bit behind the exceptional Dead Cells, but it suits the game well and never drags down the enjoyment to be had.If I was forced to describe the audiovisual presentation of Ori and the Will of the Wisps in a single word, it would be \u201cDANG\u201d. It could be argued that Will of the Wisps is the best-looking game released this console generation. A mix of colorful, dreamlike vistas paired with wonderful animation never fails to impress. Unlike the original game, which used loads of 2D animation, the sequel is presented in 3D, allowing for better, smoother animation from all parts of the visual output, from characters to environments.\u00a0The original game had animations and movement locked to 30Hz, with even the PC version unable to add much to the experience, even for those with powerful rigs. It could be run at 60Hz on PC, but going beyond that resulted in weird quirks and some serious audio problems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da6213ac-8fc6-4987-8f51-6b80186bf3c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "da6213ac-8fc6-4987-8f51-6b80186bf3c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4a1455c-79f6-4625-92c4-095b3d5d4f37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "986bd1c80c10d302c0d4f5414306d527b304b8d106542a310bb46c83ab07ec78"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6e5cd1d-a7dc-4063-bcd4-c63a71700a57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aac5e699fa9b8ed783388d6fc93349b609ba813cd32e728fe4276a703d40fc79"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b428a5d-0f29-44be-9033-e64d31f75a8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d3eae0524c49bef7395ac65a9f65087327246520c28b3309f2bf08b44480c614"}}, "hash": "b049fca3122f860e72674769b40feaac25adccaf4e71ef5e027b2a919f2b76a4", "text": "Will of the Wisps suffers no such limitations, running at 60Hz on the Xbox consoles and even higher on well-equipped PCs. The difference in visual presentation is akin to when the Street Fighter series moved between the hand-drawn animations of Third Strike to the 3D Street Fighter 4.\u00a0The image has depth, with fluidly-animated foreground vegetation sometimes occluding the picture and serene background scenery oozing style. The camera will often zoom in and out to emphasize important moments and situations. The wide-angle perspective on the impressive boss encounters is a particular standout, especially when accounting for the diminutive Ori. The accompanying soundtrack does its job well, working with the narrative to wrestle some tears out of the player during heavy moments and providing bounce during the more hectic platforming challenges.I hesitate to wholeheartedly recommend Ori and the Will of the Wisps to all but the diehard series fans at this time due to some technical issues and oversight specific to the PC version of the game. I was given a code for the Windows 10 version, though a Steam version is also available on launch day. On my PC, I ran into stuttering issues almost immediately. After troubleshooting and a few reinstalls, I believe the issue may be due to background loading, as the performance problems I had never seemed to have any direct correlation to spikes in CPU or GPU usage. The faster I would navigate through the world, the more often the framerate would take a dive and then quickly recover. Running the game at resolutions from 720p all the way up to 4K revealed similar behavior and it made the difficult platforming and combat sections of Ori\u2019s journey feel incredibly laborious.Adjusting settings for better performance, a mainstay option for PC games is not a possibility for Ori and the Will of the Wisps because there are virtually no video options, save for a motion blur toggle and VSync toggle. The VSync solution seems to be of the double-buffered variety, meaning that if your framerate drops from 60Hz to 59Hz for a split second, the game drops all the way down to 30Hz and the back to 60Hz, effectively exacerbating the stutter issue. I tried running uncapped at 1080p, but was never able to get close to a steady 120Hz, even on a powerful PC. Monitoring tools showed around 40% GPU usage and 15% CPU usage in this scenario, so I\u2019m not sure what was holding the game back from smooth output.\u00a0HDR output is also absent from the PC version I reviewed, which is a huge bummer. I\u2019ve had this game on my radar since its first E3 showing years ago waiting with bated breath at the prospect of taking the journey with expanded dynamic range and color volume, but, as of right now, this feature is only on Xbox One.\u00a0 Save for volume sliders, the rest of the available options were similarly limited. The inability to rebind anything or swap movement from the control stick to the directional pad is a letdown. I always prefer to do platforming with a directional pad and being forced to use the stick took a bit of the enjoyment away for me. I was told that an update for the PC adding HDR support and additional options was in the works, but no firm timetable for release was given.Genre fans and devotees of the first game should put Ori and the Will of the Wisps on their must-play lists. It looks like a million bucks in motion (when the performance holds together) and the narrative is sure to please franchise followers. The standout musical score and a major expansion of the game world and its mechanics are all a welcome addition to the experience. We are living in the golden age of metroidvanias and Will of the Wisps will deserve to stand with the best of the bunch should its technical shortcomings be resolved. 8/10 sugar glider/rat/rabbit/catsThis review is based on the Windows 10 store PC version.
