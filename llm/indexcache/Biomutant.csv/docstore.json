An open world RPG filled with odd creatures\nExpect to pay: $60/\u00a350\nDeveloper: Experiment 101\nPublisher: THQ Nordic\nReviewed on: Nvidia RTX 3080, Intel i9-9900K, 16GB RAM\nMultiplayer? No\nLink: Official site\u00a0Biomutant is a boring game that survives on charm. What other open world game stars a bipedal mutant cat-thing that specializes in martial arts? This is an RPG in which you can leap from your grotesque, grinning horse, summon a ball of mucus around yourself to roll up your enemies like ants on a moist jawbreaker, 'detonate' the mucus to send them flying, and finish with a slow-motion Max Payne-esque volley of electric bullets from a gun with a trumpet horn for a muzzle. It's tragic, then, that hollow progression and an incessant narrator suck out so much of the joy in Biomutant.\u00a0Biomutant feels like it's going to be much more, but in practice it's an endless stream of new ideas that go nowhere and beautiful, toxic landscapes with little to offer except an excuse to use photo mode. (I'm at 127 screenshots and counting.) It's especially disappointing because Biomutant's nonchalant, optimistic vision of the post-apocalypse is a refreshing take on the end times, with a weasel dressed like Elvis for every fascist cannibal emperor in Fallout.\u00a0But if you strip out the gangly, affable muppets, all that's left is a broken open world RPG with little else to discover except another cheap riff on the same color-matching puzzle, plastered over a rotary phone or microwave or whatever. At least it looks amazing.\u00a0Biomutant's human-free post-apocalypse is both stern and sweet. It imagines the worst case scenario for mankind: total eradication from pollution, late-late-capitalist greed and exploitation, war\u2014it's a who's who of the biggest bummers. But it also depicts a vibrant world teeming with life after we're gone.\u00a0Even though there's another apocalypse on the way, it's embraced with curiosity and inevitability by most of earth's future fur citizens, from a hulking chef who only aspires to make the tastiest food possible to a mousy fashionista who wants everyone to dress how they feel before the earth implodes.\u00a0Aww.\u00a0I respect stories that give the void a warm hug, so I'm surprised how much the narration and writing made me wish Biomutant's world ended yesterday. David Shaw Parker's performance as the omnipotent narrator isn't bad, but his saccharine tone clashes with the fragmented English in the writing, which is often embarrassingly twee. I never want to hear a Shakespearian voice describe piss and shit as \"yellow juice\" and \"brown bobs\" ever, ever again.\u00a0If I couldn't slam spacebar to move things along, Biomutant would be made irredeemable by the narration aloneThe way it's paced prolongs the pain, every conversation opening with a few seconds of cute mutant gibberish, after which Parker reads the text I've already skimmed in the same indulgent full-throated tone and primitive syntax, no matter the context. Simple sentences take a couple seconds to decrypt because every other word is replaced with a complicated compound. \"That's a Pling-plong-booth from the by-gone, back when you needed to cable words via buzz-wire instead of air-waving them\" instead of 'People used to stand in boxes to talk'. When Parker reads these lines aloud I feel like I'm being mocked. It's unbearable.The characters don't help. They're written more like fuzzy parables than three-dimensional fur-people. Cute glimpses of their personal lives are interrupted by long-winded lectures on morality, intercut with your character's inner monologue, all narrated by Shaw.\u00a0If I couldn't slam spacebar to move things along, Biomutant would be made irredeemable by the narration alone. It's a case of subtraction by addition, a performance that washes over and homogenizes the impressive breadth and creativity in the mutant models, and glazes over their surface level allegory with lethal levels of pomp and circumstance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba439455-d256-4de9-be85-301987685734": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba439455-d256-4de9-be85-301987685734", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd7f4a00-7997-4244-81fb-960eef25d2e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8b5a5b2472ca3586ce03680289fd756d5924ff2c71a14df5f65d4ec0186a27ef"}, "3": {"node_id": "26768ce4-db94-415d-b328-e3355d92690e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fbb433bee0d4d3b495d1982706e0fb6b139fd77ca0acf9d26df3d4e26e1e85d"}}, "hash": "dbc92603eb3ab3cf38e51400f35859ddfc5bfffe6ce681e92f195982c247a3ad", "text": "Biomutant's beautiful world is much better off speaking for itself, from a distance at least.\u00a07 tips for getting the most out of Biomutant\nBiomutant's pesky narrator can now be turned offIt's easy to see why Biomutant draws so many The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild comparisons. There's my little ferret guy coasting through the air on a paraglider, the gnarled roots of the Tree of Life spiraling off in every direction, grassy knolls cut through with rivers and roads, an old highway crumbling above it all. Orange buttes jutting up in the east, a massive black scar to the west, a crumbling city skyline sinking into the crust\u2014it looks amazing on a good PC. Every vista is a promise of adventure, but nearly every journey is the same.\u00a0The classic open world mantra applies here: If you see it, you can go there. But should you go there? Probably not. That eerie tower at the top of the mountain and the deep cavern buried beneath the suburbs are both just full of junk loot and simple puzzles like every other location in Biomutant. Sidequests are bland too, most of which involve finding old world technology to complete an impressive breadth of variations of the same spinning dial, color-matching puzzle.\u00a0The lack of imagination is so absurd that you'll even rotate measures of sheet music to solve some puzzles\u2014like, strips of music pinned to paper. Other objects laminated with the same orange and white node-matching puzzle: TVs, arcade machines, fuse boxes, film projectors, radios, record players, microwaves, globes, meteors. Meteors! It's never fun.\u00a0So I'm still surprised, after dozens of pointless collection quests and puzzles that are barely puzzles, how often Biomutant forces me to stop and reckon with what I'm looking at, be it a weasel in a space suit piloting a hot air balloon over a blackened chasm, or a huge ancient tortoise shuffling around the continent looking for a carrot to match their metabolism. Biomutant is a pretty good time if all you want is something strange and nice to look at.The first lap around the map, I was drunk on Biomutant's scenery. It's a genuinely stunning setting and you get some fancy rides to unravel it with, including a huge mechanical hand that turns into a literal hand cannon. Is it useful? Almost never. But is it cool? Yes, which defines the bulk of Biomutant, really. Because whether stomping around the ruins of a city in a huge mech or gliding through a toxic swamp on a homemade jet ski with an iron dragon head bolted to the front, the terrain is rarely an obstacle or threat, and the creatures in the farthest corners of the map are rarely a bigger problem than those in the starting area.\u00a0I didn't have to think much about Biomutant's stat game at allCombat scenarios almost always consist of a burly mutant accompanied by some little guys, and a few melee and ranged minions, but they're easily taken care of by any means. Dodge, shoot, punch or slash\u2014your verbs are limited\u2014I can't recall a single fight that forced me to take a look at my gear, stats, and powers to do some serious theorycrafting.\u00a0Enemies are largely the same basic archetypes with different fur coats, and while they're all incredible to behold\u2014from huge tigers in denim vests to oily-eyed tree stump wolves\u2014they're not much fun to fight after a couple hours, in part because of how quickly your stats and powers balloon in Biomutant. Layer in perks, per-level stat boosts, and psi powers, and your cute little mutant will hit demigod status alarmingly fast.\u00a0It's fun to suck up everyone in a giant mucus ball and dive around the arena like a John Woo action hero at first, but combat is so easy I didn't ever have to think about where I was spending my perk points or stat upgrades. Even if I played messy I always had a huge stock of scavenged health kits to dip into. By hour five I didn't have any psi powers left to acquire. Besides the occasional gear swap, I didn't have to think much about Biomutant's stat game at all.\u00a0A bummer, because there's an impressive breadth of combat styles and weapon types to work through, everything from hammers and boomerangs to dual pistols and bo staffs. There's a hypnotic rhythm to fights: melee combo, ranged weapon peppering and repositioning, psi-powers for elemental damage procs or crowd management, and then back to melee.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26768ce4-db94-415d-b328-e3355d92690e": {"__data__": {"id_": "26768ce4-db94-415d-b328-e3355d92690e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba439455-d256-4de9-be85-301987685734", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbc92603eb3ab3cf38e51400f35859ddfc5bfffe6ce681e92f195982c247a3ad"}, "3": {"node_id": "ffc8dfbc-3b81-401f-88be-931f5c0113cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4456c568729048218cf6cfea29f10afeb3bcd13b4cf07fd7c1aba43d0a0e73bd"}}, "hash": "6fbb433bee0d4d3b495d1982706e0fb6b139fd77ca0acf9d26df3d4e26e1e85d", "text": "It feels alright!Thank goodness for The Power of Cool though, because combat never gets much deeper. Every attack comes with unique animations, replete with dramatic slowdown and blur effects to sell the drama and athleticism. It's exciting at first, but perfectly timed dodges and exquisite weapon combos don't matter much when you've crafted gear that makes your HP kiss the moon and a single punch deadly enough to kill god.\u00a0I love the expressive, experimental potential of Biomutant's crafting system. Bolting nails onto beanies to juice my fire resistance, or cobbling together a freeze-inducing shotgun with a fast reload speed should speak directly to a min-maxer's heart. But it's all lost on flat combat design that never encourages you to spec out gear for unique challenges.\u00a0In my first few hours I put together a toxic toilet brush and fiery rolling pin for a dual-wielding melee build, forcing every enemy into comical puking or pants-on-fire animations, health bars collapsing in seconds. A few hours later I assembled a gun that mutilates the most difficult enemies, from towering elephant sasquatches to bus-sized raccoons, even faster, sucking the air out of every challenge thereon.\u00a0For all its problems, I still liked parts of BiomutantI mean, I love it when RPGs reward gear tinkering and careful customization by shooting me ahead of the difficulty curve for a bit, but Biomutant never humbled me with a powerful new enemy or combat configuration so that I could repeat the experience.Biomutant's irradiated zones require some gear tinkering, but for small returns. Sticking around in these areas for too long in armor without the proper resistances will kill you, so building outfits around specific biomes is touted as a key driver in Biomutant's progression.\u00a0But what you find in these deadly, alluring areas are just more simple fights and some rare loot you probably don't need. There are no huge narrative revelations or truly unique encounters to dig up. The irradiated zones are just like everywhere else in Biomutant, only dressed up with some extra visual effects to sell the danger of burning alive, freezing to death, suffocating, or sprouting a third arm.Just a few hours of running off to explore and do sidequests gave me a surplus of high level loot, rendering most of the vendors, upgrade stations, and the basic crafting systems themselves useless for the bulk of my playthrough. With no need to buy or upgrade items, I didn't need to put any leveling points into my barter skill, and I can only recall two minor conversations that benefited from my high persuasion stat. So everything was funneled into health, strength, agility, and my mutant psi powers. The hard difficulty option can't account for the glut of gear and simple combat design in Biomutant. If you take any prolonged detour, you'll quickly outpace whatever it throws at you.\u00a0But here's that charm again, barely keeping me afloat in the form of my Kylo Ren-looking ferret decked out like a JNCO jeans catalogue model. If only my huge pants made a damn difference. And I guess they kind of do, because for all its problems, I still liked parts of Biomutant.\u00a0I enjoyed it with a big pained grin much like the horrific smile of my spherically domed horse. I grit my teeth through the painful narration and groundless progression, if only to see what kind of fucked up muppet it would throw at me next. Biomutant is an extravagant cartoon diorama unlike anything on PC, it's just not much fun to play or listen to.\u00a0Biomutant's stunning world barely survives the painful narration, broken progression, and dearth of stuff to do.

Like clockwork, a life sign would emerge, with the announcement that yes, it's coming, definitely, just not right now. In part, this is due to developer Experiment 101 having been granted an unusual amount of freedom by their publisher to keep adding stuff, which led to a game that always sounds like a lot on paper - a character customisable down to their genetic makeup who can wield any weapon, a crafting system allowing you to make virtually anything, a morality system, a map dwarfing even Skyrim's. It's full of superlatives any marketer would love, confident in selling itself as something you've never seen before. Trouble is, you absolutely have.To be fair, you've never controlled a character quite like this. The protagonist here is a mutant, a furry being reminiscent of a cat, or maybe more of a rodent, depending on which visual you're going with during character creation. You and others of your species are adept in the art of kung-fu, but you can also wield giant swords, guns, rocket launchers and karate weapons such as bo staves, sai blades and more. You can pick up any weapon regardless of your character class, which makes the classes superfluous - you can even find multiple ways to learn the starting perks each class comes with even if you chose another.To understand other areas in which Biomutant can't live up to the expectations it set itself, it's important to remember this is a game made by a team of just 20. You see it in the way copies of environments exist around the map, how some animations had to be foregone, how text repeats with certain actions. In many ways, it remains a marvel when considering the size of the team. The giant map often looks exquisite, its lush and vibrant forests flanked by ruined towns and toxic wastelands. The game runs like a dream on PC, with next to no need for loading screens and the framerate plummeting very rarely during some of the heavier action. The sheer amount of crafting items - screws, blades, bent metal, bats - is just as impressive as the many different skills the team thought of, like the psi attacks and toxic bio powers you can use in addition to melee and ranged combat. But every feature falls victim to the game's quantity over quality maxim. Take the crafting. Visually it's a lot of fun to tool together an axe and a vacuum cleaner, but of course near-endless variety in weapon design can't lead to endless variety in fighting styles. Instead, each weapon you make falls into one of four different categories, and just like that, we're on familiar ground again. To be clear - four fighting styles is still a lot, but then you have to keep in mind the strength of each weapon, meaning that if you want to switch, you might have to farm the right materials first. A great idea foiled by underlying mechanics. Biomutant simply wastes a lot of its own energy - and mine - in ways like this. You can tame mounts, only to find they're slower than your own running speed. In a lengthy side quest, you can search for materials to upgrade the mech you'll use in one boss fight, only to find the encounter is already too easy without them and you shouldn't have bothered.From afar, Biomutant's Devil May Cry-esque combat looks responsive and snappy. In reality, it feels as weightless as food wrappers blowing in the wind.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb397a89-0dd8-4cad-b5da-6f16dc668d78": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb397a89-0dd8-4cad-b5da-6f16dc668d78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffc8dfbc-3b81-401f-88be-931f5c0113cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4456c568729048218cf6cfea29f10afeb3bcd13b4cf07fd7c1aba43d0a0e73bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ef4278a-d701-45e8-8302-d1aeb739b014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1704f289eee5611d6cc69836d84fa8af436efaedd0f67af360269d182b5fcd66"}}, "hash": "366348470accaba656ab379cec59dc457faa378af28a42855a21e27f77d03723", "text": "In reality, it feels as weightless as food wrappers blowing in the wind. Apart from the weak and sometimes entirely non-existent controller feedback - which obviously you won't miss using mouse and keyboard - it's also there in the animation quality. They're quite slow sometimes, hits don't visibly connect, and effect visuals, even the fun comic onomatopoeia, can't properly convey impact. The far-reaching consequences of this are an unfortunate masterclass in the importance of impact in animation, because whatever you do in Biomutant, no matter how wild things get, from piloting a mech to bouncing around in balls of viscous liquid, it always feels underwhelming.The overall balancing in combat feels off, as well. Biomutant has some visually wonderfully imaginative, huge foes, who will all rip you up like the aforementioned food wrapper, regardless of your level. If that was the intention, a la Horizon: Zero Dawn, I could deal with it, but an enemy's health bar and level are always prominently displayed, making me think there should be a difference at some point. No matter how many fun kung-fu manoeuvres I can do, it all wildly loses its appeal once I find out it's better just to use ranged weapons because being caught underfoot just once costs me half my health bar.Weirdly enough, this doesn't make Biomutant difficult, just repetitive. In many ways, it's far too easy - you can hack away at a regular enemy's giant health bar for ages, but down a boss with a lot less effort. It's a shame because Experiment 101 clearly poured so much into Biomutant's boss design. Those main battles, where I both got a special gadget to fight and an enemy with an interesting attack pattern, feel like Biomutant at its best - but then you go back to scrounging for loot or engaging in a collect-a-thon of side quests to the tune of  \"find every microwave\" and \"flush every toilet\". Several items necessary for progress were so out of the way from the main quest location that it felt as if Biomutant held items hostage so that I'd look at the entire map. Now and then you're asked to solve a rotation puzzle, and every puzzle plays the same - you turn knobs left or right. It's disappointing.Technically Biomutant doesn't have a story. Well, it does have a story - you're asked to fight a number of big monsters in order to revitalise the World Tree and stave off impending doom - but it doesn't have a plot. You know what you've got to do, and all that's left is to do it. Everyone does kung-fu, so there's a lot of talk of unity and harmony, honour and the value of training, but it's literally just hot air - the few characters you meet don't have conversations with you, they offer calendar quotes and some exposition, and your only way to participate is to ask for clarification - at one point when a character told me the end of the world tree would mean the end of the world, I had the options to ask \"World Tree?\" and \"The end?\".An incorporeal narrator (David Shaw Parker) follows your kung-fu rodent's adventure, but he doesn't narrate, he comments (\"Fine weather to be out\") and makes combat noises (\"Blam! Kapow!\"). He also translates what characters are saying to you, because apparently no one in this world speaks your language, including the members of your own race. He will announce night and day, even when you're inside, in sometimes truly bewildering ways (\"Better perk your ears up, darkness doesn't hurt sound\"). You can tone him down if he gets too much for you, and he will, but you can't shut the narration off completely. The entire game uses baby speak to such an extent it sometimes took me a moment to figure out what it was even talking about.There are enemy camps to take down - an open world staple - occupied by six warring mutant factions. You pick one of two starting factions, the good one or the bad one, and then you go off and take your rival's bases. Genuine effort has been put into having each of these skirmishes play slightly differently, and it's greatly appreciated, but a clan war in the middle of a story about the end of the world is an entirely different, yet curiously mandatory thing, narratively unmoored, tacked on to make the game bigger. There are a lot more narrative inconsistencies, like the long conversation about the value of life and honour before you go and set an entire base on fire, but there's not much use in thinking about it, since I suspect no one will play this particular game for its narrative.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ef4278a-d701-45e8-8302-d1aeb739b014": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ef4278a-d701-45e8-8302-d1aeb739b014", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb397a89-0dd8-4cad-b5da-6f16dc668d78", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "366348470accaba656ab379cec59dc457faa378af28a42855a21e27f77d03723"}, "3": {"node_id": "f00b3f01-9a1d-4ace-b609-51c394ff24b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4377d28caf4b6685cf9235d0cf025ef92fb65ccdd0a5323021c70f424c772cd0"}}, "hash": "1704f289eee5611d6cc69836d84fa8af436efaedd0f67af360269d182b5fcd66", "text": "Biomutant shouts a lot about its Aura system, basically just another morality system, but this, too, is close to pointless. No matter what faction you pick, no matter whether you kill or not, not only do you have the option to change your mind about whether that makes you good or bad each time - making none of the touted moral choices permanent - the choices also amount to nothing but points for your psi skills. Both 'routes', as it were, play the same.Experiment 101 took years to stuff a game with features instead of focusing on its strengths to deliver a quality experience half as long. Everything that exists seems to have been made so that someone could say wow, look at all this stuff, yet the sad truth is all of it is available elsewhere and in better quality, likely because you can't take on AAA open-world games in scope if you're a team of 20. That a team of this size felt they had to deliver something of that magnitude says a lot about the rabid appetites of the gaming industry, our obsession with \"more is more\" and how it's possible to whittle something genuinely innovative down to a nub.It hurts to say that about the effort of a team that tried to work crunch-free and was given an amount of time and creative freedom other developers can only dream of. But the whole game feels like an exercise in adding certain open-world staples, always erring on the side of caution. I've said this before, but even when gaming, more so than any other medium, feels like the place where we gladly accept being served the same things over and over, the safer we play it the more oversaturated the market feels.

No part of this website or its content may be reproduced without the copyright owner's permission.\nMetro GameCentral, A brand new franchise offers an unusually positive of view of post-apocalyptic life, with one of the prettiest open world environments ever.If there\u2019s one thing the video games industry needs to encourage more of it, it\u2019s new IP (intellectual properties) \u2013 games that aren\u2019t just sequels, spin-offs or licensed tie-ins. So it\u2019s very upsetting when, within the first hour of playing just such a thing you get the overwhelming feeling that it really isn\u2019t very good. That\u2019s even more unfortunate when there are positive elements, such as the graphics and the customisation option, that the rest of the game never properly utilises.Although the presentation is almost that of a children\u2019s story book \u2013 we\u2019ll get into the tonal inconsistencies shortly \u2013 in gameplay terms Biomutant is a fairly standard open world action role-playing game. It\u2019s a while before the setting becomes clear but it\u2019s essentially post-apocalyptic, except instead of arid deserts and ruined skyscrapers the landscape is dominated by lush greenery rather than the ruins of the old world.The implication is that the various tribes are evolutions of previously non-sentient creatures, with their current forms all looking like anthropomorphised rodents, bears and the like. Most are not identifiable as anything specific though, with your own player character being merely vaguely cat-like. Or at least they are before you start mutating them further.The actual plot of the game involves a Tree of Life being slowly poisoned by an oil spill, as monsters gnaw at each of its many roots. You can imagine what role you have in all this is, but as well as defeating the Worldeaters you\u2019ve also got to recruit the six tribes to your cause \u2013 except it\u2019s impossible to get them all onside at once and so you have to choose whether to pit one against another in order to leave only Tree of Life-friendly allies.These almost Game of Thrones style machinations sit awkwardly beside the game\u2019s peculiar presentation, which includes an ever-present narrator who seems to be trying to do an impression of the book out of Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, except without any jokes.All the animals speak in a gibberish noise and the narrator has to translate these back to you in English, preceded by comments like \u2018He says\u2019 or \u2018She thinks\u2019. That not only ensures every conversation takes twice as long as it should but immediately distances you from it as well, ensuring it\u2019s almost impossible to care about any of the characters or events.The tone Biomutant takes is fairly bizarre given the combat is like a simplified Devil May Cry, as you switch between guns and swords.

The most interesting element of customisation is the weapons though. Not because there\u2019s a massive difference between most of them but because they\u2019re all made out of different bits of post-apocalyptic detritus and fitting together broken road signs and machine parts with little or no restriction is quite fun.The fact that you have to resort to such minor parts of the game to provide entertainment says it all though, as you quickly settle into a predicable routine where each boss has to be defeated using a different vehicle that you have to find the parts for before it works. Not only is the structure formulaic but it also undermines the whole customisation aspect of your character, in that you end up beating the game\u2019s biggest enemies when behind the wheel of a speedboat or mech \u2013 not using your own abilities.In the end, the best part of Biomutant is simply the open world itself. There\u2019s nothing terribly interesting going on in it but it is very pretty, to the point where we thought we were playing the PlayStation 5 version at first. The colourful visuals are a real breath of fresh air, especially for a post-apocalyptic game, and the only downside is that the animals aren\u2019t really that cute, even though we think they\u2019re supposed to be.The real problem with Biomutant though is that it\u2019s not really a new game at all. It may not be a sequel but the influences from other games, from Zelda: Breath Of The Wild to Fallout, are very obvious and almost never done as well as in the original games. The moral decisions, for example, usually lack any kind of grey area and none of them seem as important as the one you make right at the beginning, about which of the first two tribes you back \u2013 one of which is obviously good and the other of which is obviously evil.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationWe would given some credit to Biomutant for trying something new but most of the time it\u2019s not, it\u2019s just copying other games and doing what they do but not as well. Its own unique ideas are invariably the most interesting part of the experience but they\u2019re not nearly enough to keep your interest.In fact, this is one of the most boring games we\u2019ve played in quite a while, with nothing so bad as to be funny or anger-inducing and nothing good enough to make you actively look forward to more. Biomutant may not look like a typical post-apocalyptic game but most of what it offers has been seen many times before.In Short: It\u2019s very pretty but this patchwork of other game\u2019s ideas never has enough of its own to keep you interested during the repetitive and overfamiliar open world action.Pros: Beautiful open world environment is one of the best of the outgoing generation. Crafting system for weapons is neat. Vehicles are fun, even if they do undermine your character\u2019s abilities.Cons: The formulaic mission structure and unexciting, repetitive combat quickly becomes a chore. Terrible storytelling choices distance you from the plot and characters.Score: 4/10Formats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PCPrice: \u00a354.99Publisher: THQ NordicDeveloper: Experiment 101Release Date: 25th May 2021Age Rating: 12Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : Shin Megami Tensei 3 Nocturne HD Remaster Switch review \u2013 Lucifer\u2019s Call\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Days Gone PC review \u2013 good port, bad game", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6b4c260-91fd-4374-b3e7-a01ee663dbe4": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6b4c260-91fd-4374-b3e7-a01ee663dbe4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad2320a7-5485-48da-9d62-e73a5b637a6d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "82fb77d8f0d4e64576a55c1aa78217e6fbfa00bcc106801989e41bdb5d743e0d"}, "3": {"node_id": "6a7c5a4b-c438-4b7f-8531-d783496e71c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "75f60ca0d1a55f3a0b48cfc61c8cf9f555c7ccb495766416a57675288d274f42"}}, "hash": "d801d72f2d044a5fb89767fb68facc1b590bf76b09550b5e8c3d1525ed5a8010", "text": "MORE : Days Gone PC review \u2013 good port, bad game\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Famicom Detective Club review \u2013 8-bit murder mystery\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.ukFor more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGamesRadar+, When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

But it's clear that developer Experiment 101 is as confused as to how to market Biomutant as I am to review it. It's a game that tries to include as many systems and mechanics as possible, taking influences from games like Ratchet and Clank, Fortnite, and Monster Hunter, and then attempts to force them into one cohesive package. There comes a certain comedy with its assortment of parts, but, overall the result is a game that never feels at ease with itself. It's confused, confusing, and yet, I kinda like it.\u00a0Release date: May 25, 2021\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PC\nDeveloper: Experiment 101\nPublisher: THQ NordixBiomutant has been a long time coming. Originally announced back in 2017, Biomutant has been plagued by delays \u2013 both from the key developer having major back surgery and from a change in vision and scope \u2013 but unfortunately, it hasn't benefited from being released in 2021. It has emerged in the shadow of other big, ambitious open-world RPGs like Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which has only further exposed Biomutant's flaws.\u00a0The game is set against a backdrop of a post-apocalypse world, where humanity has been wiped out by pollution, corporate greed, and nuclear power exploration. The world left behind is dominated by the titular Biomutants \u2013 strange animal hybrids that are part cat, part rabbit, and 100% capable of wielding weaponry. These creatures have formed six tribes, who'll you need to either unite or destroy to bring harmony to the land, which is also plagued by four world eaters \u2013 known as Puffs, for some reason. These huge beasts have been attacking the world tree (the last bastion of life on earth), and it's up to you to defeat all four and protect what's left. Sounds dramatic, right?Well, it's undercut by the fact the narrative is delivered in the most painful of ways. Characters will speak to you in gibberish, then after a pause, a narrator tells you what they've said. It's so slow that I found myself skipping the gibberish to get to the narration, only to accidentally skip over both, losing crucial slices of information or quest objectives. Like Horizon Zero Dawn, the characters have developed their own names for various human elements, which only adds to the fact the narrative can feel like a children's storybook. For example, a piano is a 'string plonk', a guitar is a 'twing-twang', and your mother is your Mooma, which is said with such drawn-out vowels it's almost impossible to take seriously. The childish language constantly butts heads with the old-world commentary, failing to strike the sort of tone you might expect from a game with such bright and inviting visuals, and the fuzziest of casts.It doesn't help that the character creation is quite off-putting. Despite my best attempts \u2013 an almost an hour of tweaking \u2013 I couldn't ever settle on a character that I was drawn to or found even vaguely adorable. Big buck teeth, teenie eyes, mismatched body parts, and other oddities were seemingly the only options, with all of that exaggerated by the Biomutant breed you opted for. The Biomutant poster child that we've been seeing for years is far removed from the little fuzzy fighter I ended up with.The character creation and story beats are just the beginning though, as this game continues to feel at odds with itself. Struggle through the very linear opening, and the world folds out before you, only to reveal that Biomutant suffers from having an abundance of systems to get to grips with \u2013 none of which are ever particularly well explained.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a7c5a4b-c438-4b7f-8531-d783496e71c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a7c5a4b-c438-4b7f-8531-d783496e71c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6b4c260-91fd-4374-b3e7-a01ee663dbe4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d801d72f2d044a5fb89767fb68facc1b590bf76b09550b5e8c3d1525ed5a8010"}, "3": {"node_id": "2239faa6-bd73-4e05-a2fb-1ec23890cd69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ee988b7f4b313431cf4fd2faabdf120e31badad5953a7b74c0e7abad3b4a81a"}}, "hash": "75f60ca0d1a55f3a0b48cfc61c8cf9f555c7ccb495766416a57675288d274f42", "text": "It's part looter shooter grind, with new weapons and armor hidden in old furniture and chests across the world, but there's also an odd and overly complicated crafting system too. I am particularly attached to an electric sword I made from an old toilet brush, but it's definitely far from the easiest system to get to grips with. There's just so much stuff.Plus, you can upgrade your character in various ways, including enhancing abilities related to the class type you picked, your resistance to different environmental elements like the cold or radiation, and the option to unlock weapon-type specific combos. But Biomutant's nested sub-menus and use of different upgrade currencies are scattershot and awkward, especially when plenty of the upgrades can also be achieved using the mountain of gear you'll discover as you explore.\u00a0The same can be said of the combat, which regularly flips from feeling clumsy and clunky to brilliantly silly, with comic book-inspired exclaims and descriptions popping up for certain combos and movements that don't ever get used anywhere else \u2013 another of Biomutant's odd design decisions. Overly subtle button prompts can leave you mashing buttons trying to return the projectiles needed to smash through defenses, and the combo patterns all depend on what you've unlocked and what weapon type you're using. The combination of ranged and melee weapons, along with Psi Powers can be great fun, though their success does rely on finding the arsenal mix that really works for your play style and class type.There's also a morality system, with your character capable of moving between dark and light polarities depending on the decisions you make. But, it constantly invades the story, makes little sense, and has seemingly no effect on the ending outcome \u2013 to the point where I am still absolutely seething about the game's closing moments.That's not to say that there isn't plenty to love in Biomutant, especially when it comes to the world it offers up. It's certainly not a graphical marvel \u2013 even running on PC on maximum settings \u2013 but there's definitely a beauty to it. It's a game rich with things to discover, from remnants of the old world, to funky weaponry and unusual foes. Some areas will be inaccessible until you've found the right gadget or better armor to protect you too, which adds a level of unexpectedness to your travels. If you're partial to a little relaxing map mopping as I am, there's lots to keep you busy and that's meant I've spent 30+ hours enjoying Biomutant despite its flaws and oddities.\u00a0The main narrative is engaging too, with a whimsical cast of characters, excellent set pieces, and bizarre story moments. Plus, the four boss battles are particularly memorable. A core part of the campaign is unlocking new gadgets, like a mech suit and jetski, which you'll need to take down each of the World Eater Puffs \u2013 that are ridiculously named Hoof Puff, Jumbo Puff, Muck Puff, and Porky Puff, which sound more like types of potato chip than big bads. But that's just part of Biomutant's overwhelming jovial personality, which relies on humor more than drama to propel you through \u2013 even if it is a little puerile and toilet-centric at times.But, every time you really enjoy a moment in Biomutant, it finds the capacity to frustrate you. Like the endless repetition of dialogue, side missions, and hidden areas. The assaults you mount as you try to unite the tribes are intensely formulaic \u2013 to the point that they reuse the same barrack and invasion sequence multiple times. Hidden vaults have exactly the same layout and aesthetics, to the point that, after you'd discovered one, you'll notice that loot and discoverables were in the exact same spots across multiple locations. And yet, there are moments where the game's attention to detail is great, such as using the ice weapon will make enemies skid across the ground like an excerpt from a Ratchet and Clank adventure.\u00a0It's such a shame, because there is a great game in here. Biomutant's world and its characters are wonderful and brilliantly silly, but these elements clash against some of the more serious elements of the core story. The intensely formulaic and repetitive moments distract from the brilliant ones that'll have you nodding in approval, or laughing at its bizarreness. And it all comes down to the fact it doesn't really know exactly what it is or wants to be. If you got Biomutant in a sale, you wouldn't be sad, but as a full-priced offering, it feels too confused to easily recommend.\u00a0Reviewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher.Sam Loveridge is the Global Editor-in-Chief of GamesRadar, and joined the team in August 2017.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2239faa6-bd73-4e05-a2fb-1ec23890cd69": {"__data__": {"id_": "2239faa6-bd73-4e05-a2fb-1ec23890cd69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a7c5a4b-c438-4b7f-8531-d783496e71c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "75f60ca0d1a55f3a0b48cfc61c8cf9f555c7ccb495766416a57675288d274f42"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d3f7322-9d19-4208-b1a0-8b20b72d47ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "457b52538e34df77597144ee38666c2e243805cc5769015a28e0222f3a4e1259"}}, "hash": "3ee988b7f4b313431cf4fd2faabdf120e31badad5953a7b74c0e7abad3b4a81a", "text": "Sam came to GamesRadar after working at TrustedReviews, Digital Spy, and Fandom, following the completion of an MA in Journalism.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nGame Informer, Much like its gene-spliced protagonist, Biomutant is a hodgepodge of ideas stitched together to form what is ultimately a mixed bag. The game blends elements of open-world design with stylish action, gunplay, crafting, a morality system, and more. Like many jacks-of-all-trades it winds up being a master of none, and a thick layer of technical jank on top of half-baked ideas makes Biomutant feel like a case of feature creep that needed to be scaled back.\u00a0\u00a0At its core, Biomutant is a typical open-world game featuring a large map littered with basic objectives, points of interests, and various environmental biomes with bizarre wildlife roaming in between. Despite its post-apocalyptic premise, the vibrant overworld is packed with color, and I love how that beauty is juxtaposed with ruins of modern civilization. A majestic Tree of Life sits at the world's center and its four gigantic roots snake for miles overhead for a wondrous sight. The anthropomorphic character and monster designs are a charming blend of strange, funny and, sometimes, unsettling.I enjoyed Biomutant most when I simply explored, stumbling upon hidden bunkers or abandoned villages and clearing them of their precious loot. Traveling gets even better thanks to a variety of transportation options, from riding various mounts to stomping around in a mech suit to soaring on a glider. Summoning a mech from the sky feels empowering until you realize some vehicles can only be used in vaguely designated zones. Being barred from summoning my boat in one clear body of water but not another puts a damper on the game\u2019s sense of freedom.Combat blends stylish melee with wacky gunplay but lacks the polish it needs, often feeling messy and imprecise. Parrying feels especially unsatisfying, and the loose lock-on system makes staying on target a finnicky pain. I appreciated the variety of special powers at my disposal such as creating trails of fire or conjuring ice storms. These abilities add a flashy wrinkle to the action, but they also don\u2019t pack as much punch as I wanted in battle, even after investing stat points into them.Biomutant\u2019s combat became more tolerable\u00a0once I acquired stronger weapons via a robust and rewarding crafting system.\u00a0After collecting random junk like old sniper scopes, trumpet horns, or even bananas, you can slap together devastating killing machines. I had a great time maximizing this system, and seeing my creations tear through monsters always felt rewarding. The same goofy satisfaction applies to armor and gear; my character rocked a mascot helmet and a polo shirt that looked ridiculous, but the outfit was augmented to be as sturdy as a suit of armor. The drive to make cooler weapons is potent and scavenging for new parts consistently felt worthwhile even when I found loot that was inferior to what I already had.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d3f7322-9d19-4208-b1a0-8b20b72d47ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d3f7322-9d19-4208-b1a0-8b20b72d47ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "2239faa6-bd73-4e05-a2fb-1ec23890cd69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ee988b7f4b313431cf4fd2faabdf120e31badad5953a7b74c0e7abad3b4a81a"}, "3": {"node_id": "53f85958-d70b-435d-8479-b354377839cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "60b3451877d4d057a1b5a3b41d2c6c0297cd59656ba9c00e71b1912d288f6fb1"}}, "hash": "457b52538e34df77597144ee38666c2e243805cc5769015a28e0222f3a4e1259", "text": "That\u2019s because you can always sell it or, better yet, break it down into valuable ingredients to craft better parts.\u00a0Biomutant boasts an overwhelming amount of side activities that are mediocre best but too many of them boil down to completing simple actions a set number of times in different locations. The tasks themselves aren\u2019t bad, they\u2019re just the definition of busy work, and the rewards aren\u2019t worth the effort half the time. Still, you don\u2019t need to worry about a lack of content in Biomutant; my quest log overflowed with things to keep me busy for dozens of hours, even if those activities were largely shallow.While elements around the edges can allow some degree of entertainment, it all feels hollow when it\u2019s funneled into an underwhelming narrative core. Upon bringing your furry hero to life, you\u2019re saddled with several big tasks. Four destructive World Eaters are killing the Tree of Life, and it's up to you to stop them. You also need to bring an end to a tribe war by joining one faction and then uniting or eradicating the rest. On top of that, the brute who murdered your family in childhood has resurfaced and must be dealt with. Did I mention there\u2019s also a life-saving Ark that holds a limited number of seats and you must determine which of your allies gets a free ride should the world go sideways?\u00a0Biomutant juggles a lot of threads but none of them are engaging. Avenging your parents\u2019 death lacks any emotional punch because the killer is barely a factor in the story, and the final showdown unfolds in predictable, anticlimactic fashion. Solving the tribe war simply involves conquering the other settlements in bland confrontations and deciding whether to kill or spare the leaders. World Eater missions have the most meat on their bones by far, with various tasks, such as obtaining vehicles, aimed to prepare you for the big fights. However, facing these beasts consists of sloppily designed boss fights that rob these titanic battles of any sense of awe. The Ark subplot feels entirely unnecessary and doesn\u2019t even make total sense if you manage to save everything anyway.\u00a0The lackluster storytelling further diminishes an already shallow morality system, which yo-yos between basic black and white choices.Throughout your journey a pleasant British narrator recites the entire adventure. He does an adequate job, but his rampant interjections outside of cutscenes wore on me after a while. The narrator also speaks for every character, which robs them of any individuality, and conversations become tedious since you have to wait for the narrator to translate the creatures\u2019 gibberish. The only other voices you hear are your two bickering fairies, which represent your light and dark side, and they became my favorite personalities by default for having, well, personality. I like that they\u2019re both jerks\u00a0constantly belittling each other while rallying you to join their side.A lackluster presentation and technical issues further spoil the experience. Cutscenes are rough thanks to stilted animations and an overall flat delivery. An occasionally wonky camera can zoom inside of objects during conversations. Cinematics sometimes end abruptly, even cutting off dialogue in progress. Playing on PC offers a smoother outing, but various bugs and hard crashes hindered my adventure on console.Biomutant consistently shows glimmers of promise but it takes patience and a pair of rose-colored glasses to see them. I genuinely loathed my first several hours with the game, but once I made cooler weapons that made combat more tolerable or admired another postcard-worthy sight, I felt more disappointed than anything. Biomutant has all the ingredients of a unique, entertaining adventure. It just spends too much time doing everything possible to try and impress its audience instead of polishing its handful of strengths.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

Yet it also consists of a mishmash of fairly obvious influences, from a Breath of the Wild-esque structure to combo-driven combat that's similar to Devil May Cry, and other familiar elements from the likes of Fallout, Max Payne, and Borderlands. It's a flavorful petri dish, for sure, and there are plenty of uneven and drab aspects to its overall design and structure. The mixture between old and new ideas doesn't always sit right, but Biomutant also manages to carve out its own identity amid its many inspirations.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Biomutant ReviewThis begins with the character creator, as you step into the flocculent skin of one of the aforementioned creatures--an odd hybrid between a squirrel, rat, and any other scurrying critter that comes to mind. Choosing a breed affects your starting stats to a certain degree, and you can pump points into specific attributes if you fancy, say, dealing more melee damage or increasing your chances of bartering with merchants. If this sounds like your typical by-the-numbers RPG progression system, it's because it is. There's some personality to the character creator, as your body shape will change depending on which stats you opt to emphasize--big head for intellect, big biceps for strength. Ultimately, however, your starting attributes aren't especially significant. You're able to put 10 points into a category each time you level up, so it's easy to build a fairly well-rounded character within a few hours.The final part of creating your character involves picking a class, which impacts both your starting weapon and the addition of a unique skill. The Commando, for instance, inflicts 10% more damage with ranged weapons, while the Psi-Freak gets access to a lightning attack that otherwise isn't available to the other classes. These aren't game-changing skills, and you'll be swapping out weapons by the dozen in no time at all, but they do add a smidgen of variety to subsequent playthroughs.The latter example is also one of the few instances where Biomutant will lock you out of using a specific ability. Even if you pick a class such as the rogue-like Saboteur, you're still able to use Psi-Powers and Biogenetics and wield any of the available weapon types, so there's plenty of freedom to play the game how you want. The only other time you're unable to unlock certain abilities is when you come across Psi-Powers that are dependent upon your Aura alliance. Biomutant's Aura system is split into light and dark sides, with good and bad deeds affecting your standing in each. It's a typical morality system, with your deeds and dialogue choices impacting how other characters see you. You're not locked into either light or darkness once you start going down one path, so there is some flexibility to play as a morally grey character and dabble in both sides of the spectrum.In truth, the majority of your choices have an insignificant impact on Biomutant's story. The biggest decision you'll make occurs within the game's first hour, as you're asked to align with one of two tribes. While the obvious light-sided tribe wants you to unite the other clans and defeat four deadly Worldeaters to save the world, the dark-sided tribe would prefer if you did the opposite by conquering the other clans and defeating the Worldeaters to cleanse the world and start anew. This essentially sets up your overarching objective and impacts the ending you'll get if you decide to stick to your chosen path, but doesn't change the missions you'll embark on to get there. Beating the Worldeaters and capturing the other tribe outposts makes up the bulk of the game either way, and the narrative just isn't interesting enough to make your choices feel meaningful.The story contextualizes your progression and gives you a reason to push on, but there's little else to it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b56dacd5-350f-473c-b306-59bd3cbcfdbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b56dacd5-350f-473c-b306-59bd3cbcfdbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "53f85958-d70b-435d-8479-b354377839cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "60b3451877d4d057a1b5a3b41d2c6c0297cd59656ba9c00e71b1912d288f6fb1"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c2c45ad-94a2-4eac-b9c4-901963f205ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "acfe020ae95b1ed380e8100ac07341bd62121e1992e2cc5b06e3416e9f3f1bdd"}}, "hash": "abd988aafcd59a71b37f4acbbd252dd0835e3063acf66424587b0682ca67ea90", "text": "The presence of an amiable narrator is a nice touch, and this omniscient voice does add a dash of personality to the game. Aside from occasionally chiming in with destiny-centric tangents, the narrator also acts as a translator for every character in the game. It's an unusual method of storytelling that alters the dialogue so that a character won't directly ask you for help--rather, the narrator will say something along the lines of: \"She explains that you need to gather wood to repair that building.\" This makes conversations inherently amusing, at least initially, but it does mean characters struggle to stand out, considering they all share the same voice. The writing doesn't do the cast any favors in this regard either, with most characters existing just to spew exposition and lore before sending you on a fetch quest. It's clear that a lot of effort was put into fleshing out the backstory of this post-apocalyptic world--or at least throwing in as many kooky names as possible--but being told about it via a verbal salvo that foregoes any sense of character isn't an engaging way to absorb it, particularly when adopting a \"tell, don't show\" approach.Unimaginative mission design compounds the story's shortcomings, as your quest to defeat all four Worldeaters always boils down to a formulaic back and forth. The general structure is decent enough, with the Tree of Life looming high in the center of the map--its mammoth roots jutting out in four distinct directions. There's a Worldeater waiting at the end of each root and a supporting character that's willing to help you reach them. The problem is that the way you reach each one is always the same. You meet a character, they reveal the vehicle you need to use, then you're sent to grab a part they need to get it working, and repeat. The vehicles themselves offer a nice change of pace, with a hulking mech and gun-toting speedboat on the agenda, among others. But the journey's always short and quick, making the Worldeaters feel anticlimactic. It's also a tad odd that you spend the game building up your own character, only to defeat the game's biggest foes while behind the wheel of various vehicles.Combat is fun in short bursts, too, although it takes a couple of hours to find its footing. The reasons for this are three-fold: both the dodge and parry mechanics require some time to get the hang of--the automatic lock-on is inconsistent--and your starting moves and weapons are underwhelming. Once your arsenal opens up and you attain a few more combos, the combat begins to find its groove, albeit one that's dictated by routine. You're always equipped with both melee and ranged weapons, and each weapon type has its own simple combos. If you perform three different combos in the middle of a fight, you can enter a state of Super Wung-Fu, where you're able to pummel enemies with a rapid barrage of attacks, soar through the air in bullet time to rain down shots or deliver a devastating ground pound to disperse crowds. Combat is built around reaching Super Wung-Fu, so most fights consist of the same three-combo routine. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but your repertoire of combos isn't particularly expansive, so you're regularly using the same moves over and over again.Psi-Powers and the mutated Biogenetics add more variety to combat, allowing you to blaze a trail of fire or encase yourself within a Mucus Bubble that enemies will helplessly stick to. Judicious use of slow-motion also gives your attacks a sense of tangible impact, and the relatively infrequent nature of combat works in its favor when it comes to staving off repetition. In between flights, you're incentivized to explore Biomutant's open world with promises of loot. Each location even features a convenient checklist so you know if you're missing anything.Although you'll occasionally find new weapons and armor when scavenging through the wreckage of derelict buildings, loot is more geared towards attaining better materials, since the best weapons in the game are the ones you make yourself. Biomutant's crafting system is dynamic, with an almost limitless amount of concoctions available for you to build. The items you make are essentially repurposed garbage, as you use whatever rusty contraptions you can get your hands on, whether it's an oversized toothbrush that was previously attached to a billboard or the handle of a broken vacuum cleaner.Experimenting with different combinations that shouldn't work is part of the crafting system's charm, and provides you with a sense of ownership over your nonsensical invention. Having said that, both melee and ranged weapons are split into distinct categories, such as one-handed slash, automatic rifles, and so on.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c2c45ad-94a2-4eac-b9c4-901963f205ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c2c45ad-94a2-4eac-b9c4-901963f205ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "b56dacd5-350f-473c-b306-59bd3cbcfdbb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "abd988aafcd59a71b37f4acbbd252dd0835e3063acf66424587b0682ca67ea90"}, "3": {"node_id": "0ac6adc8-bfc0-4fd8-8a27-d931707d07e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c1a2b6eeb7d59b08e28910e4cb43faaf91a8c5938386b6aa499f9b703a20a85"}}, "hash": "acfe020ae95b1ed380e8100ac07341bd62121e1992e2cc5b06e3416e9f3f1bdd", "text": "The weapons within these categories don't feel all that different from one another, which does take some of the shine off the crafting system. Charging into battle with a new weapon that has enhanced damage numbers is still inherently satisfying, however.Biomutant often has these moments, where its systems don't quite cooperate and you end up with something uneven. While combat is fun in moderation and the crafting system is bizarre in all the right ways, the flip side of this is dull and monotonous quest design, a forgettable story, and hollow morality. There's still an enjoyable game here, but a lot of unfortunate caveats come attached to that statement. Yet while it might not always hit the mark, Biomutant is an ambitiously flawed game from a small studio, and the games industry could always use more risky endeavors like this one. Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nKotaku, Some four years since open-world action RPG Biomutant was first revealed to the world with a cool trailer, it\u2019s finally out. Although for those who\u2019ve waited so patiently to play it, they may well be disappointed to discover a gorgeous but janky mess, overly ambitious but under-achieving, and really rather broken.Biomutant is the first game from Swedish developer Experiment 101. The team, which is made up of around 20 people, decided to start out big. Biomutant is a large, action RPG set in a new and unique post-apocalyptic open world, filled with mutated, intelligent animals and no humans. It also boasts a full morality system, multiple endings, a long list of side content, a variety of vehicles and mounts to use, full narration, a crafting system, randomized loot, ranged and melee combat, power-ups, and probably other things I\u2019ve forgotten about. Every few hours during my 18-hour playthrough I found myself stumbling into a new mechanic or feature of the game and saying out loud, \u201cWow, now this is part of the game too?\u201d Sadly, Biomutant struggles to pull all of these pieces together and make them work.The game is set in the far future, long after humanity has escaped Earth after a giant corporation destroyed the planet with chemicals, deforestation, and mining. That company\u2019s meddling and awful practices ended up mutating all life left on the planet, leading to a world filled with sentient animal-people who can also shoot magic and energy from their hands. But this strange, quirky world is in danger. A large tree\u2014known as The Tree of Life\u2014is dying, and when it goes, so too does the world. Four powerful creatures, Worldeaters, are eating its large roots, killing it in the process. Your furry character, whom you create at the start of the game, has returned home to the tree to save it and reconnect with the people they left behind after a deadly attack on your village killed your family.This setup and the state of the world were hammered into my brain during the game\u2019s unbearable intro. The first few hours of Biomutant are a bore, broken up by bland tutorials and overly long exposition dumps, all of which are delivered by the narrator. A narrator who ends up being a problem for the whole game, as the British storyteller is one of only three voice actors in the game who speaks English. Every conversation you have in Biomutant is translated by him. Every event that happens, every moment of in-world lore, relies on this same British dude and his admittedly nice voice. It quickly becomes grating and makes the world of Biomutant feel small and cheap.It doesn\u2019t help that every animal in this game talks forever about morality, life, death, destiny, and more. The writing is extremely preachy and redundant, leading to me dreading each time I met a new character, not a great feeling to have in an open-world game. It also made the narrative hard to care about as it all became a lot of lectures about the same topics, all voiced by the same guy. It was like I was stuck in a never-ending TED Talk.Once you get out of the awful opening section and the game opens up, things get better.Biomutant\u2019s main gameplay loop goes like this: You get told which Worldeater to target next, make your way up to that area of the open-world map, meet someone who talks too much, help them fix up a vehicle that can kill the big creature, then use said vehicle to fight and destroy the Worldeater.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ac6adc8-bfc0-4fd8-8a27-d931707d07e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ac6adc8-bfc0-4fd8-8a27-d931707d07e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c2c45ad-94a2-4eac-b9c4-901963f205ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "acfe020ae95b1ed380e8100ac07341bd62121e1992e2cc5b06e3416e9f3f1bdd"}, "3": {"node_id": "faaa8847-15be-4502-92e9-b0a84615eeb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5010e75b17e649d7819f98902a04a39953805d0de74c9a59fe38411c58882010"}}, "hash": "5c1a2b6eeb7d59b08e28910e4cb43faaf91a8c5938386b6aa499f9b703a20a85", "text": "After that you head back to the Tree of Life in the middle of the map, talk to your older mentor about what to do next, and repeat.Biomutant mixes together melee combat, unarmed action, and gunplay into a mostly slick gameplay experience. Within only a few hours I was quickly and smoothly flipping around large groups of enemies, popping some with my guns, killing others with my big sword, and even using neat mutations and energy attacks to clear out groups of baddies. All of this feels effortless, once you get a hang of the somewhat floaty controls. Soon I was also creating and building my own weapons and augmenting my armor and gear with junk I found while exploring the world.None of this is revolutionary, you\u2019ve probably played a few games that did a lot of these things, but Biomutant\u2019s setting and the way it tries to bring them all together is impressive, even if it doesn\u2019t succeed every time. For example, you have a ton of weapons and fighting styles to unlock and try out, from two-handed swords to unarmed to hammers. But they mostly all use the same basic combos and feel similar. Various guns feel more distinct but suffer from having a lot of options, but not much depth in each. Though this does mean that once you master the combat you\u2019ll be able to quickly switch to new and different attack styles without needing to relearn 20+ new combos. This makes it very easy to experiment in Biomutant and try out new ways to play, which I appreciated greatly.However, the looping gameplay quickly becomes tedious and it doesn\u2019t help that almost nearly every sidequest and main quest in Biomutant is a fetch quest. Many of the sidequests will ask you to go off and collect 10 or 20 things. I did a handful of these, but found that I leveled up quickly enough, and discovered great loot, without bothering with more, so eventually I just stopped doing them.While trying to save the world, you\u2019ll also be able to take part in a large war raging between half a dozen or so animal tribes spread across the map. You pick to either join the Jagni, who want to kill all the other tribes to bring peace, or the Myriad, who wish to dominate and merge all the tribes under them to bring peace. The Jagni are presented as evil and the Myriad are positioned to be the good guys, though the game does allow you to criticize either tribe\u2019s methods throughout the game.The tribal war questline involves attacking and taking over enemy outposts and camps dotted all over the map. Sometimes, depending on your stats, you can talk the enemy tribe into surrendering. I was leveled up enough by the end to even bring the whole conflict to a close with a conversation, forcing some tribes to join the Myriad without having to lift a finger. It was a nice reward for putting skill points into my intellect attribute, though beyond this moment the RPG skill system felt underutilized. Just one more feature in this big muddle of a game that doesn\u2019t quite get the love it deserves.\"Furry Simulator 2021 Is Darker Than I Expected...\"Open-world action RPG featuring guns and kicksA colorful world, slick combat, furry friendsBuggy, too many fetch quests, crappy performance, annoying narratorExperiment 101May 25Xbox One, PC, PS4 (Played via PS5) Around 19 hoursEverything you do in the game not only earns you XP, which helps you unlock new abilities and moves, but it also influences the morality system. (Feeling exhausted by features yet?) This is split between dark and light. You\u2019ll never forget this system exists because the game constantly stops what you are doing and has two demon-like creatures appear, who talk in weird voices and go on for far too long about morality and light and dark choices. The morality system touches a lot of Biomutant. Some characters won\u2019t talk to you or work with you if your aura is too dark or light. Some abilities, like energy attacks, are also locked behind aura levels. And how the game ends is tied directly to the choices you make, who you help and don\u2019t help, plus your overall aura. While the morality system is a neat idea, in practice it ends up being mostly useless because you can quickly max out your aura and never think about it again.

It has a colorful look and style, using brightly colored menus and comic book-like pop-ups during combat. The world is also lovely to look at. I took a lot of gorgeous screenshots of sunsets, irradiated forests, and neverending red canyon deserts. Some areas of the game, known as deadzones, can be filled with neon-colored particles, gasses, and plants. These areas, which feature deadly hazards like cold weather or radioactive material, are dangerous to explore without a suit. Though at higher levels I was able to spam health kits and explore freely without. The game doles out health packs like crazy, so this was a viable strategy later in Biomutant. Another example of a neat idea that isn\u2019t properly working. At least these areas provided good loot and nice screenshots using the photo mode.If Biomutant sounds like your kind of game, and it might be, one thing to keep in mind is that it\u2019s currently a buggy mess. This could change with patches, but at least now, I would be wary of recommending it to anyone who can\u2019t stand some jank in their experience. On PS5 I dealt with 18 crashes. It ended up being about one every hour I played. I also had times where I got stuck in the floor, unable to move or fell through elevators. Menus would sometimes screw up and not show me the correct stats, like showing damage values on health kits. Performance was also a problem. On a PS5 the game struggled to maintain 60 FPS during gameplay and it would often freeze randomly for a second or two during large areas or combat. It never made it unplayable, but if I wasn\u2019t reviewing this game for work I\u2019d have stopped a few hours in after the fifth crash and countless bugs.It\u2019s a shame that Biomutant isn\u2019t a better put-together piece of software. Its world feels unique, the way it blends different combat styles is fun and it\u2019s a visual treat to look at on a big 4K TV. But countless bugs, performance issues, overly talkative NPCs, boring quest design, and a sense of overall jank makes it hard to excitedly share this game with people. If you can put up with the rough edges and don\u2019t mind an annoying narrator, you might have a good time with Biomutant. There is certainly a lot to do. But if you prefer more stable games, I\u2019d advise waiting. .\nGame Revolution, \nBy\n\nPaul Tamburro \nHow did this happen?\u00a0Biomutant\u00a0has been in development since 2015, originally set for release in 2018, before being delayed all the way into 2021. We\u2019ve seen smatterings of footage here and there and the occasional playable build, with developer Experiment 101 being so quiet that they even had to confirm the game wasn\u2019t canceled. Typically, this signals a game being sent out to die by its publisher as a result of it not meeting internal expectations. But no\u00a0\u2014 Biomutant is somehow one of the most boundlessly fun, ambitious, and creative open-world games I\u2019ve played, surprising me at every turn with its unapologetic focus on letting the player have a good time. So again:\u00a0How did this happen?!I was waiting for the moment Biomutant would collapse in on itself. Its opening greeted me with a barrage of information, from the \u2018Dark\u2019 and \u2018Light\u2019 moral decisions you can make throughout the game, to its exhaustive crafting system, to its combination of melee and ranged combat.We\u2019ve repeatedly seen what happens when a developer has too many ideas, and these ideas shoved into a massive open-world suggested disaster was imminent. But that disaster never came, with its various features and systems bouncing off one another with a fluidity rarely seen from massive developers, let alone Experiment 101\u2019s small team.The reason why I have fallen quite in love with Biomutant can be best exemplified by my most recent adventure in it. I\u2019m over 40 hours in, playing through a New Game+ save after completing its story (which took roughly 25 hours, including a good amount of exploration). While heading over to an objective, I stumble upon a crack in some rocks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb1cb277-d9c5-4dba-a9f2-49564c69bdfd": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb1cb277-d9c5-4dba-a9f2-49564c69bdfd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "faaa8847-15be-4502-92e9-b0a84615eeb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5010e75b17e649d7819f98902a04a39953805d0de74c9a59fe38411c58882010"}, "3": {"node_id": "e95bad8a-2de3-492a-9f7e-5329e58c946c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4373ecccf04f1c99e5ac891eeedf9af4353acfe60c0f803d7c31c0b8ad248c7d"}}, "hash": "668f6681291a3bfb1d97ee9eabc4fb261f6d21ac24a4c823c5998a168960c31d", "text": "While heading over to an objective, I stumble upon a crack in some rocks. I venture through, and I\u2019m told that I\u2019ve entered a mysterious location hiding some Superb Loot. I\u2019m never one to turn down Superb Loot, so I walk through its dank cavern, before being confronted by a towering monster named \u2018Bubba Sknarfs.\u2019 I take out my custom-built shock rifle and mow it down, pilfering through its gargantuan pockets for items before heading further into danger. I take down tentacle monsters appearing from out the water, use my mutant abilities to spawn mushrooms I can jump on to clear colossal jumps, and proceed to get incredibly lost on the hunt for this elusive loot.Then, I stop myself: \u201cWait\u00a0\u2014 what was I supposed to be doing?\u201dBiomutant is full of these moments where you\u2019ll unwittingly find yourself straying off the beaten path. Its inveigling world design, full of little mysteries hiding in plain sight around every corner and over every hill, invite you in until your initial goal becomes a vague memory.Even after spending so many hours with it, I know that I\u2019m still going to be surprised when I jump back in. Experiment 101 released a screenshot of the player-character as a bat, and I have no idea what that is! I have completed this game, deeply investigated almost every nook and cranny I have come into contact with, and I have still yet to come across any form of wearable bat wings or similar bat attire. I know that this surprise is still waiting for me, among many others, and I know that I\u2019m going to continue to be distracted by a thousand other things before I eventually find it.I could feel Biomutant\u2019s mutated claws sinking into me due to its exhaustive and immensely satisfying crafting and customization. If you already know of Biomutant, then it\u2019s likely as a result of it letting you make your player-character really intelligent by way of giving it a big head. That\u2019s its biggest selling point right out of the gate, and it doesn\u2019t disappoint.Your anthropomorphic protagonist\u2019s skills and abilities are directly related to its appearance, with the slider that adjusts its height, width, and proportions also changing its strength, agility, intellect, and the like. There\u2019s a monstrous charm to these character designs\u00a0\u2014 think gross-out \u201990s cartoons rather than furry-friendly Sonic the Hedgehog characters.\ufeffThis level of customization extends to weaponry, which can be upgraded or built from the ground up by the player. Weapons fit into different categories such as one-handed melee, shotguns, and rifles, with you able to either build them from the ground up or tinker with existing weapons. You can create a whole arsenal of equipment that\u2019s unique to you, from making a revolver with an add-on that lets it shoot out ice blasts, to attaching a big fuck-off Final Fantasy sword to an ancient axe handle and having it also leave radiation in its wake.Speaking of radiation, Biomutant\u2019s offbeat world is the by-product of its after-effects, following its near-extinction at the hands of an ambivalent and pollutive civilization that came before them. This civilization is gone now, and in their wake are mutant animals of all shapes and sizes stuck in a spectacular furry apocalypse, with a world reliant on the literal Tree of Life that sits at the center of everything.However, this Tree is facing its own major problem, as several Kaiju-sized monsters known as the Worldeaters are gnawing on its roots. The tribes of this land each have their own differing opinions in regards to how this threat should be handled, and you must decide who to align with.\u00a0Should the world be saved? Or should it be left to die and a new world born in its place?Its inhabitants speak their own language, with various dialects being adopted by different species, so a (very British) narrator provides translation for them. It\u2019s an interesting choice and one that certainly isn\u2019t going to please everyone, but I found it to be charming. It also helps further illustrate that this is a very alien world you\u2019re exploring; it\u2019s kind of like Star Wars\u2019 Cantina scene, but on a grander scale.Biomutant\u2019s story is split between a classic revenge tale as you hunt the killer of your \u2018Mooma\u2019 (mother), a grand adventure to save the planet as you go after the Worldeaters, and a war drama as you become entrenched in its tribal feud.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e95bad8a-2de3-492a-9f7e-5329e58c946c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e95bad8a-2de3-492a-9f7e-5329e58c946c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb1cb277-d9c5-4dba-a9f2-49564c69bdfd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "668f6681291a3bfb1d97ee9eabc4fb261f6d21ac24a4c823c5998a168960c31d"}, "3": {"node_id": "baaf777b-11b5-4487-8740-2959e58b4fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8b5d039f0a5eaf4880ea7af57afa85dab2303c34b212ae5cec9fe78ec8bc5d7"}}, "hash": "4373ecccf04f1c99e5ac891eeedf9af4353acfe60c0f803d7c31c0b8ad248c7d", "text": "While it\u2019s not the most memorable of yarns \u2014 though lore you find throughout the world fills in its world\u2019s intriguing backstory \u2014 the presence of the narrator gives it a fairytale feel, as though you\u2019re part of a bedtime fable you have direct control over. The decisions you make along the way will grant you either a Dark or Light Aura, which will have longstanding ramifications on both the fate of your player-character and the world altogether.The various characters you meet will have their own opinion on your moral alignment. If you have a Dark Aura, morally good characters will treat you with suspicion and hesitancy while bad characters will applaud you. If you have a Light Aura, you\u2019ll be hailed by the former while berated by the latter.You can talk to\u00a0anyone within this world, from the creatures you\u2019re sent to on your main missions to the random civilians roaming around. Some will present you with new side-quests you may have missed, while others will simply offer their thoughts on the impending demise of their planet. For a game about mutated rodents, there are some genuinely thought-provoking philosophical lines in its script, with Experiment 101 having clearly been inspired by ancient Chinese proverbs.This inspiration is also present in its visual design and characterization, with there being many characters, costumes, buildings, and the like with a clear Eastern influence. I can\u2019t speak to how well Biomutant pulls this off given my lack of knowledge or experience in that department, but it appears to have been handled respectfully, while also making sense within the context of the game\u2019s world. Its Eastern inspiration isn\u2019t merely used as window-dressing, with this being evident across its story, script, design, and combat.Biomutant adopts its own martial art form in \u2018Wung Fu,\u2019 a style coined by your Mooma who trained the heads of the tribes you now find yourself stuck between. Wung Fu is a seamless blend of melee, ranged, biogenetic, and Psi-powers, with you being able to pull off combos across all four which leads to righteous, stylish action. Even after many hours played, I\u2019m still excited whenever I stumble upon a turf war, which will see me zipping between rival tribes and monsters, hitting them with special moves, all while slow-mo is liberally applied to emphasize its most awesome moments.Your class choice will determine a set number of unique abilities you will have, though mostly every other ability can be obtained regardless of which class you occupy, save for some which are restricted to those with Light or Dark Auras. Classes are traditional RPG fare, from the ability-heavy \u2018Psi-Freak\u2019 to the ranged weapon connoisseur \u2018Dead Eye,\u2019 and upgrade points to improve your proficiency in these areas are obtained when you level up. You can also use upgrade points to unlock different special attacks for different categories of weapon, with three of these attacks activating Super Wung Fu mode, in which your damage is amplified and you can pull off additional heavy attacks.All combos are each limited to a few hits, with the inputs required for them handily indicated on the UI. You can start doing cool stuff almost immediately; one of the earliest unlocked abilities allows you to plug a couple of punches into an enemy, before throwing them into the air and spiraling them into the ground with a vicious piledriver. Mostly every special attack feels impactful and looks slick, with the simplicity of its combat system allowing players across all skill levels to string together elegant attacks.But that doesn\u2019t mean Biomutant is an easy ride. Enemies initially take a good deal of punishment before you\u2019re able to take them down, and you shouldn\u2019t expect them to wait for you to pull off an exhaustive combo before they attack back. The likes of Ubisoft\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed may follow Batman Arkham\u2019s counter-heavy lead, and while there is timed parrying here, there are plenty of enemies of various shapes and sizes who won\u2019t care for your dazzling moves and will instead charge right at you. Still, as you progress and level up your abilities and upgrade your weaponry, you eventually feel like an MMO raid boss marching through its landscape, defeating behemothic beasts with wild abandon.However, there are some monsters that will take a much bigger kicking. The four Worldeaters you must face each require you to obtain a special mount to help you take them down, with these battles being unlike anything else you encounter in the game. While none of these encounters are particularly challenging, they make for grand visual spectacles that had me popping open Photo Mode more times than I could count.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "baaf777b-11b5-4487-8740-2959e58b4fe2": {"__data__": {"id_": "baaf777b-11b5-4487-8740-2959e58b4fe2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "e95bad8a-2de3-492a-9f7e-5329e58c946c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4373ecccf04f1c99e5ac891eeedf9af4353acfe60c0f803d7c31c0b8ad248c7d"}, "3": {"node_id": "9df86dfb-15c0-4d71-b38e-7900ab214872", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "34a50789fc083863817cf085e0303686f50cadcde737c20d3a54d5d4c07bc87c"}}, "hash": "c8b5d039f0a5eaf4880ea7af57afa85dab2303c34b212ae5cec9fe78ec8bc5d7", "text": "There\u2019s one boss fight that had a real Godzilla vibe to it, complete with the Worldeater and I crashing through towering buildings as lightning rained down.Outside of the mounts you use to fight the Worldeaters, there are various other animals in the game\u2019s world that you can ride. There are multiple different biological mounts you can befriend with unique designs that range from fluffy and cute to slightly terrifying. My favorite is the Surfipelago Gnoat, an unsettling horse creature with glowing white eyes and an uncannily human face. It is adorable but it also looks like it would try to kill me in my sleep, which can be said for mostly everything in this beautiful yet strange setting.And Biomutant is beautiful alright. There are a number of biomes to explore, from glorious tropical vistas through to sludgy, oil-covered wastelands. There are remnants of the extinct human civilization in its world, but this isn\u2019t some hopeless, sludge-brown hellscape. Even though the Tree of Life may be struggling, it\u2019s still teeming with color and personality.I loved how I could stand perfectly on the precipice between two completely different environments, both of them with their own unique enemies and design. There are certain areas such as heat zones and radiation zones that require you to build resistance to enter them which contain their own secrets and surprises, and an entire sprawling desert that I only realized I hadn\u2019t ventured into until after completing the game\u2019s story.With this being an open-world game, it\u2019s not without some technical issues, though in my playthroughs these were mostly limited to frame rate drops in certain busy areas. I experienced a couple of visual glitches and one particular error where a side-mission wouldn\u2019t activate correctly, though compared to other games of this scale, it runs great. I experienced a consistent 60 FPS in 4K on PC with the occasional hiccup, but it rarely detracted from the action.One notable bug that I encountered, which I hope is promptly fixed in a post-launch patch, saw the clothing I equipped to handle hazardous zones not increasing my resistance. While there\u2019s specific clothing I could obtain via side-missions that acted as a workaround to this problem, it was still a tedious issue to face, though will presumably be rectified in a future update.Biomutant is a lively, stylish, and downright joyous open-world game that doesn\u2019t get bogged down in the conventions of the genre. There\u2019s no bloated story here, and its vibrant sandbox setting is anything but barren, as I felt compelled to explore every nook and cranny I stumbled upon in its vast, gorgeous world.Its combat and crafting systems combine to create effortlessly cool action with tons of customization options, making your arsenal of weapons feel uniquely your own. While its story may not be its focal point, its narrator and wonderfully odd selection of characters are full of charm, with its morality system and eco-friendly message making me feel like I was a part of a thoughtful children\u2019s fable.Considering Biomutant\u2019s delayed and seemingly troubled road to release, I\u2019m blindsided by just how good it is.\u00a0Experiment 101 has clearly been afforded the time to see its vision through, something which is unfortunately far too rare in the cutthroat gaming industry. I did not expect this to be one of my favorites of the year so far, let alone one of the most enjoyable open-world games I\u2019ve ever played.

It was announced back in 2017, I pre-ordered it in 2019, and here is finally in 2021. Its feature list has always struck me as over-ambitious, especially for a small team like Experiment 101. It was billed as this fully adaptable game that let you make all the decisions in what you do and how you approach the game\u2019s main objectives. I had my doubts that it would deliver, and now that it\u2019s finally here, I can firmly say that no, it doesn\u2019t quite make it. It\u2019s a bag of chips. Delicious, delicious chips.Biomutant (PC [Reviewed], Xbox One, PS4) Developer: Experiment 101 Publisher: THQ Nordic Released: May 25, 2021 MSRP: $59.99To be fair, Biomutant truly is a game with a lot of flexibility. You can be a complete jerk or a selfless hero, you can make the world worse off or try to save it, and a lot of the game\u2019s activities are optional in the truest of senses. Success can be achieved, even if you want to partake in one of the game\u2019s main mechanics or not.It\u2019s not true freedom, of course, just freedom within reason. The narrative in\u00a0Biomutant\u00a0centers around a post-apocalyptic world struggling for breath. Humanity screwed the environment badly, and the planet\u2019s new inhabitants, the mutated predecessors of our wildlife, have been trying to keep things from getting worse. However, the Tree of Life is dying. A plague is spreading, and a quartet of munsters are eating at its roots. Which is where you come in.You\u2019re some sort of wandering ronin returning to their homeland after considerable time away. Finding the tribes splintered and in turmoil, the Tree of Life withering, and munsters taking over, you set to work getting things back in order. If this means crushing everyone and helping the tree on its way, then have at it, you munster.Mutant is a pretty apt description of Biomutant. At times, it feels like a twisting or mutation of particular formulas. It\u2019s also narratively a bit of an amalgamation. It\u2019s hard not to get a whiff of Breath of the Wild, Fallout, or Far Cry. There\u2019s four munsters divided into the four corners of the map that you can take out at your own pace or just whenever. There are tribes you can unite or destroy or just ignore. You know that territory system where your map has little blotches on it telling you what belongs to what tribe? It\u2019s here.It has RPG mechanics and crafting, there are zones that are hazardous unless you\u2019ve gathered gear and upgraded your character to resist their inflictions. There are munsters to be honted and cosmetic stuff to find for your various vehicles. It\u2019s a big, sloshing bucket full of stew.Which isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s bad or even derivative. It has its own flow, the world has its own feel, it\u2019s just a lot. It\u2019s hard to complain about having so much content, especially in a game that is launching at a bargain price. Every time I\u2019d start feeling like things were becoming routine, it would introduce something surprising that I hadn\u2019t been expecting. I\u2019d be going through a graveyard and suddenly be assaulted by skeletons or I\u2019d find ruins that contain a gameplay mechanic I didn\u2019t even know about. It tries to excite at every corner, and it largely succeeds.There was even one particular moment where I got that feeling like I was playing through someone else\u2019s fetish, which was a little discomforting. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s supposed to be innocuous and I\u2019ve just spent too much time on the internet.The mutation comes from the fact that not every facet got the same amount of love. The alignment system, for example, either needed to be cut or polished. On the surface, it\u2019s pretty typical: release the prisoner or punch them in the face for no reason aside from the chance to be a dick. That\u2019s disappointing in its own right, but the larger issue is that you\u2019re mostly just collecting good and bad karma, and that\u2019s it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c200cd3f-af81-44fc-8a54-187d00abbbd0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c200cd3f-af81-44fc-8a54-187d00abbbd0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "9df86dfb-15c0-4d71-b38e-7900ab214872", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "34a50789fc083863817cf085e0303686f50cadcde737c20d3a54d5d4c07bc87c"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3ec6da1-c8e7-458b-96b0-acb546263d7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "687041165979cd1d77ca812d3b13e2945f2ff878862b641a8844f7766e99891f"}}, "hash": "9c163f5bd708d039f73aa09cdaea51efc4e02de9213ce019b598485f72099bfb", "text": "Sure, characters will call you a dick if you\u2019re a dick, but let me explain.Most of the time in Biomutant you\u2019re just deciding whether or not you want the good points or the bad points. Spare a tribe\u2019s Sifu or lock them up. Destroy a tribe or bring them into the fold. Release prisoners or give a speech about something. It\u2019s nothing meaningful. It could have been something like siege a tribe outpost until they starve or challenge the Sifu to single combat, but it\u2019s not. And sometimes I\u2019d trip across dick actions by accident. I walked up to boxes of food and got the \u201cinteract\u201d prompt, and when I pressed it, my guy just burned the boxes for no reason. It would take a long time to upset my karma ratio, it\u2019s just out of character for a hero character.The tribes are another half-baked mechanic. Three want to unite the tribes and save the world, the other three want to destroy the tribes and end the world. There aren\u2019t two in-betweens, those are your options. You\u2019re also forced into joining one of two tribes at the beginning of\u00a0Biomutant\u00a0(even though advertising says the tribe war is optional), but you can then join another tribe at the cost of betraying your current one. I did this by accident. I just wanted to ask one of the other friendly tribes if they wanted to unite, and the next thing I knew, I had to retake territory I took for my previous tribe.It\u2019s a lot of open-world weirdness. I\u2019d have difficulty naming one of these games that doesn\u2019t have disappointingly raw mechanics floating around, I just kind of expect it at this point, but Biomutant is a game so crammed with content that you go from dizzying highs to nauseating lows pretty frequently.It\u2019s that pervasive smell of, \u201cwe eventually need to release this game.\u201d At some point \u2014 and maybe this was dictated at a corporate level, but it had to happen \u2014 they had to take all the pieces they had and put it together into a complete, playable experience. That means some of it is extremely good, and some of it is barely worth doing, and the fact that it\u2019s all stirred together means that you can\u2019t have the good without tripping into the bad.I could honestly write an essay on all the little ways that Biomutant disappointed me, but I\u2019d lose even the bravest soul around the 4,000 word mark and everyone else would just scroll straight to the score anyway. I wish the narrator would shut up every once and a while. There\u2019s actually a slider for his frequency, but I\u2019d swear it didn\u2019t do anything. He\u2019d still remind me it\u2019s night three times a night. It\u2019s also stupid easy. I don\u2019t play open-world games for their challenge, but after I realized I never used healing items, I kicked the difficulty up to hard. Then I created a gun that eliminated the remaining challenge.So, yeah, I can gripe about Biomutant\u2019s shortcomings until the gnoats come home, but I feel that would give the impression that I didn\u2019t like the game. On the contrary, I really enjoyed it. Exploring its world was a joy, finding a new \u201cultimate weapon\u201d that I could take apart and turn into an even better weapon was always exciting, and it kept providing new experiences throughout its runtime. The combat is fun, allowing you to mix and match different abilities to find the best way to inflict pain. It also does a good job of leaving it up to you how you tackle the game, providing a bevy of options and just letting you choose what you want to do.It\u2019s just got a lot of loose screws, which is horrifying to see on a roller coaster, but not quite the same omen of death in a video game. I think the team did the best they could putting all the little pieces together, and the amount of content that resulted is dizzying for a bargain priced title developed by a small team. I honestly think that Biomutant\u2019s potential isn\u2019t going to be fully realized until a sequel, spiritual or otherwise, but what\u2019s here is perfectly entertaining.I had a lot of trouble tearing myself away from Biomutant, and a lot of my grievances didn\u2019t really surface until I\u2019d finished it and had time to digest.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3ec6da1-c8e7-458b-96b0-acb546263d7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3ec6da1-c8e7-458b-96b0-acb546263d7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c200cd3f-af81-44fc-8a54-187d00abbbd0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c163f5bd708d039f73aa09cdaea51efc4e02de9213ce019b598485f72099bfb"}, "3": {"node_id": "848e04a3-e967-40cb-ac34-7c205b0d1f92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c11c28063d8be771b4cc1138f28c94ddcb17800dddec873451e0bd720dd75797"}}, "hash": "687041165979cd1d77ca812d3b13e2945f2ff878862b641a8844f7766e99891f", "text": "Before that, I was absorbed in exploring its well-designed world, plumbing ruins, collecting dopey looking mounts, and dressing like I just survived a landfill explosion.

Login NowExperiment 101 and THQ Nordic's Biomutant looks to deliver a truly unique open-world RPG.Nearly four years after it was first announced, and about six years since it first went into development, Biomutant is finally being released. The debut title from developer Experiment 101, this open-world RPG is set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with some gnarly looking creatures. While it\u2019s certainly an enjoyable time, there are some ideas that don\u2019t come to fruition in Biomutant.In Biomutant, players take on the role of a small furry creature, who is destined to be the hero of this post-apocalyptic world. The game\u2019s character creator is pretty extensive, as players select their breed and choose their base stat spread. Something neat about the character creation progress is that the base attributes that players choose will impact their character\u2019s physical appearance. For example, increasing your intellect will literally give you a bigger head.There\u2019s a variety of classes in the game, which allow players to specialize in different gameplay styles, whether that be the sharpshooting abilities of the Dead-Eye, or the magical powers harnessed by the Psi-Freak. Although players do indeed align themselves with a class at the beginning of the game, your choice isn\u2019t set in stone. In fact, the class you select is more of a way to get players started on a desired path. You\u2019re free to upgrade and pursue a playstyle in any of the different classes in Biomutant, regardless of what you choose at the start.The main story in Biomutant revolves around the Tree of Life, which appropriately gives life to the world inhabited by our protagonist. After it\u2019s put in jeopardy by an oil spill as well as deadly creatures known as World Eaters looking to consume its roots, the player will find themselves caught in the middle of a fight for the future of the entire world. There are six tribes that players will encounter, each with their own motives in relation to The Tree of Life. Half of the tribes seek to destroy the World Eaters and save the tree, while the other half look to aid the creatures in destroying it, as they believe the world needs to be cleansed so civilization can start from scratch.Players will have the option to align themselves with one of the factions present in Biomutant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "848e04a3-e967-40cb-ac34-7c205b0d1f92": {"__data__": {"id_": "848e04a3-e967-40cb-ac34-7c205b0d1f92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3ec6da1-c8e7-458b-96b0-acb546263d7b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "687041165979cd1d77ca812d3b13e2945f2ff878862b641a8844f7766e99891f"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e9e7aca-7067-4451-9d62-c78b4d5c0092", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "513b6cade3d1190466f1de6d192df87300710ac86755fe2132237bc27c43d81a"}}, "hash": "c11c28063d8be771b4cc1138f28c94ddcb17800dddec873451e0bd720dd75797", "text": "Siding with one of the light side factions will set the player\u2019s end goal to saving The Tree of Life, while siding with a dark faction will set the goal to destroying the tree. This is where Aura comes in, the game\u2019s constantly evolving moral scale.The decisions players make will directly impact their Aura, either adding more to the light or dark side. Though the whole binary dynamic of good vs bad is something that RPGs have moved on from, it works for Biomutant\u2019s Fable-inspired style.As an RPG, I really like how the branching pathways and Aura shape Biomutant. The way you choose to play is clearly reflected in the world, whether that be allying with and uniting each of the tribes, or striking down all of those who stand in your way. It invites replayability, and makes me eager to see how my journey contrasted from my friends and colleagues.With a wide variety of ways to approach Biomutant from a narrative standpoint, there\u2019s also a lot of ways to approach combat. Melee weapons, guns, and psychic abilities are among the many ways players can take down the array of vicious creatures the game will throw at them. The game\u2019s real-time combat system allows you to adjust on the fly and quickly swap between weapons. I found myself tagging up enemies from a distance with my revolvers, leaping into close-range action to quickly deal some melee damage with my twin sais.Combat in Biomutant is incredibly frenetic, as I was constantly on the move whenever I was in a fight. In addition to dashing and leaping, the game also gives you a double jump that will briefly slow down time. It\u2019s these elements that make combat feel like something from a martial arts film.Players can also acquire and upgrade perks and mutations to their character, in addition to the game\u2019s base attributes. The way the different categories are laid out in the menu felt needlessly intricate, as I was constantly flipping between pages and entering/exiting menus when I wanted to upgrade my Wung-Fu or check out the available mutations.Biomutant\u2019s crafting feature is pretty robust, as players can take the parts they find and match them together to make weapons as well as gear. You can use this to put a rusty handle on your blade, or give your armor that extra flair. It\u2019s not all cosmetic, as parts will also apply statistical bonuses to weapons and armor.Though Biomutant is set in a post-apocalyptic world on the brink of another disaster, the environments are still full of color and brimming with energy. It\u2019s refreshing to have a game of this nature that isn\u2019t visually dreary and flushed out. The game is gorgeous, and the use of camera focus makes every battle feel cinematic. That said, it\u2019s a bit of a shame that the world itself can feel boring at times.The world in Biomutant is fairly large, with unique regions to discover and explore. However, the game suffers a bit from open-world syndrome, where a lot of areas between the points of interest don\u2019t feel all that interesting. Sure, there are minibosses to take down, as well as loot and collectibles to find, but most of my time in the open-world was spent getting from point A to B. I wish there was more meat to the exploration aspect of Biomutant.Biomutant is a solid debut from Experiment 101. Though a couple of the game\u2019s concepts don\u2019t feel entirely fleshed out, there\u2019s still a lot to appreciate. The amount of variety in both the narrative and in combat ensures that no two players have an identical experience. With a fluid combat system and enough style to spare, Biomutant is still a formidable RPG.This review is based on a Steam code provided by the publisher.

With every firm but light-hearted smack across its papier-mache arse it spewed out more little treats and tidbits and brightly-coloured flashy things, and the more it spewed, the more I hit it, and the more I hit it, the more queasy I became, and yet I found I couldn\u2019t stop \u2019til I\u2019d beaten it into a shredded pulp and gorged myself on its offerings until the room was spinning.My point here is that there is a lot of stuff to do in Biomutant. Like, a massive amount, but I hasten to add that I cannot knock the ambition behind Biomutant. Evidently Experiment 101 at some point held a brainstorming session during which someone switched all the waters with high-sugar energy drinks and hid the board rubbers. From the outset you\u2019re populating your map with flashing icons, and you\u2019ll still be finding new stuff after 20 hours.But if Biomutant is living proof of anything, it\u2019s that there really is such a thing as too much of a muchness. From the moment you open up the character creation screen, it begins hurling silly words and nonsensical terms at you and it rarely stops. Your first task is to create a custom rodent-like hero from a bunch of presets which you can then fine tune with sliders. My little white and blue rat-rabbit only took a few minutes to create, as I was quite happy to sling all my initial points into Vitality and Agility and select the Saboteur class, because dual-wielding makeshift guns and blades sounded cool.The classes on offer represent the usual RPG fare such as the Commando who does more damage with rifles and the Psi-Freak, who can wield Biomutant\u2019s form of magic like a wizard. Thing is, it doesn\u2019t matter much, because it doesn\u2019t take long to realise that one thing Experiment 101 weren\u2019t interested in was creating a challenge.Much noise has been made about Biomutant\u2019s combat being based loosely on the frenetic bloodletting in Devil May Cry, and I can certainly see the similarities there, in the same way I can see the similarities between the driving in Forza and the driving in Crash Team Racing. Because while Biomutant\u2019s combat definitely looks great in trailers, in practice it\u2019s a little less impressive.It\u2019s nice to be cartwheeling around bad guys and seamlessly mixing melee and ranged combat, but it\u2019s nicer when you can feel the impact of each blow and sadly, Biomutant just doesn\u2019t deliver punchy, exciting combat. Yes, you can flip about the place and employ a form of magic, and yes there\u2019s more slow motion action than Zack Snyder filming a fight between two OAPs in a vat of treacle, but there\u2019s rarely anything to force you to use your entire arsenal. The free-class system allows you to pump points into whichever stat you like, and so by around 10 hours in I\u2019d ditched the dual blades for a whacking great sword that poisoned my enemies, and a rifle that I haven\u2019t had to swap out for the 25 hours since equipping it.There\u2019s an argument here that things are only as fun as you make them, and I suppose you could throw caution to the wind and wade in with your dukes up, but there\u2019s absolutely no penalty for circle-strafing every single enemy while shooting them until they catapult off in slow motion. You\u2019ll rarely take a solid hit, let alone die. A lack of weight to the melee combat leaves the experience looking pretty but feeling hollow, and despite trying to engage with it in a meaningful way on multiple occasions I struggled to see any encounter as more than an obstacle between me and Biomutant\u2019s beautiful, loot-filled world.Rarely outside a Ubisoft sandbox have I seen a map so densely packed with places to explore and secrets to uncover. You can\u2019t run for more than 30 seconds in any direction without coming upon another abandoned intersection, dilapidated house, underground bunker or secret vault.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf251623-8104-4f37-bc25-390fe111a915": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf251623-8104-4f37-bc25-390fe111a915", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "5855617d-502f-40d1-9c46-dcea1403ec8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aa7bdee311f8c49996aa124b2050f16467481b429dabb972cd929dae3e8f759d"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2df9d76-bff6-47db-84c0-799eff3a961d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "48ab7512ec98061a6de9d0152b6bdfaae18087c767647966bd61501b86062170"}}, "hash": "67038484bc22feafadac5cd2a26f364e2b3c18732576cafda7ae730f890afb7f", "text": "A little checklist accompanies each new area, helpfully marking off anything you find until you\u2019re told the area is complete and you know there\u2019s nothing else to search for.

Set in a world that has survived an environmental apocalypse courtesy of the Toxanol Corporation, whose disregard for the planet\u2019s health led to the end of civilisation, Biomutant presents a fairly dark story that often feels at odds with its attempts at humour and levity. The narrator, for example, rarely shuts up, and even translates the grunts and whistles of the NPCs you\u2019ll meet, while character and enemy names run the gamut from harmlessly weird to downright unpronounceable, which in turn makes them thoroughly forgettable. Not a good thing in a game that gives you so, so much to think about.The world is split into separate biomes, each controlled by one of six warring tribes. Initially you\u2019ll be asked to choose one of two sides to work with, and will wage war upon the other. You can choose to be ruthless or merciful, which will affect your Aura and decide whether you \u2013 and, by extension, the world \u2013 leans towards light or dark. This affects various things, such as which NPCs will give you side quests, which monsters you\u2019ll encounter frequently and which characters will accept a seat on the Ark. The Ark, by the way, is a ship ready to carry you away from the world if your attempts to save it fall to ruin.The similarities between Biomutant and Breath of the Wild are evident almost immediately. You have a glider, for instance, and must find specific hazard protection suits to survive in hostile areas. But an even greater similarity is the structure of the campaign. This sees you tackling four huge bosses in different corners of the map in order to remove the corruption from the world. This and the tribal war are the main driving factors behind Biomutant\u2019s slightly disjointed story.This leads to you repairing and manning various vehicles such as a mech and a submarine to do battle with the World-Eaters. Even these campaign elements are too easily beaten, however, boiling down to fetch quests and short fights. Only one gave me any trouble and that was more down to iffy design than real difficulty. And sometimes merely suggesting that the leader of a rival Outpost simply not fight you. This works far too often and too easily.I had more fun exploring the world and playing with loot than I did tackling the story. The crafting in Biomutant is pretty cool. While you can collect armour (and there\u2019s so much of it) for each part of your body, including a backpack and face mask to wear as well as your helmet or hat, you won\u2019t find half as many weapons. Instead you\u2019ll find parts everywhere that you can use, on the fly, to make new gear from scratch. It\u2019s an excellent system, but while there are outfit slots for quick-changing your armour and clothing, it would have been handy to have a similar system to switch weapon compositions on the move \u2013 especially as you spend so much time in the saddle of something or other as you explore.There are gorgeous, colourful meadows, scorching deserts, frozen wastelands, and dense jungles on offer here. Biomutant\u2019s world is vibrant, bustling and full to bursting. Settlements dotted here and there present new side quests, vendors and upgrade stations for your gear. Hidden caverns go deep underground and hide precious loot for your furry little fingers. An impressive draw distance grants you glimpses of far-off treasure troves that you\u2019ll glide, ride, fly or swim to, and a huge variety of weird and wonderful monsters lurks in the shadows. Oh, and it\u2019s not often a game offers you a huge mechanical hand as a mount, complete with a powerful finger-cannon, so there\u2019s that.It\u2019s quite easy to get around the world using fast travel points, which you pee on to activate, because why not? The spacing is sometimes a little odd, given that some are so close you can see one from the other. Elsewhere, some are so far apart you\u2019re desperate to find one by the time you do.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2df9d76-bff6-47db-84c0-799eff3a961d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2df9d76-bff6-47db-84c0-799eff3a961d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf251623-8104-4f37-bc25-390fe111a915", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67038484bc22feafadac5cd2a26f364e2b3c18732576cafda7ae730f890afb7f"}, "3": {"node_id": "da43713b-3eca-4a34-a773-e33f78949c20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "42c31863427eacb245c171cb50277ea343c7416bba67419b872cbed9e3bfd20a"}}, "hash": "48ab7512ec98061a6de9d0152b6bdfaae18087c767647966bd61501b86062170", "text": "But you will zip around the map awful lot, mostly on fairly mundane fetch quests, or to tick things off the long, long side-quest checklist. Most old-world gadgets you can find such as telephones, TVs, and computers will require you to solve a fairly rudimentary puzzle. There are a few different types, but they\u2019re all super simple to overcome. Ancient gym equipment, on the other hand, will improve your physical attributes after a brief bout of button mashing.Biomutant doesn\u2019t really do anything wrong, in that it accomplishes most of what it sets out to do. As an open-world RPG it may be a little too easy for genre veterans, and as a looter it certainly showers you with a ton of the stuff in a huge array of rarities. But it does struggle in the two areas that arguably matter most: combat and story. The world itself is great to explore, peppered with things to find and people to meet \u2013 but there\u2019s almost too much of it at times.It\u2019s also worth noting that even though I played on PC, Biomutant hasn\u2019t been fully optimised for \u201cnext-gen\u201d yet. This means the load times between areas or deaths are pretty long. I also encountered noticeable slow down after loading into an area, and occasional drops in frame rate. Usually these issues cleared up fairly quickly, but they\u2019re worth a mention.If you\u2019re going to be guilty of anything, then \u201ctoo much ambition\u201d is hardly a negative. Biomutant is a genuinely enjoyable adventure that suffers primarily from being too stuffed-to-the-gills and a little bit tonally pendulous. The combat isn\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d, but it misses the mark where it counts. The laboured, none-too-original story is balanced out by the inventive world. Whether Biomutant clicks with you or not, the simple truth is that, although you may well feel a pang of the familiar now and then, you\u2019ve almost certainly never played anything like it.Looks gorgeous\nSuperb crafting\nLots to see and doCombat is too loose\nStory feels disjointed\nLong, long load timesBiomutant is a game that overreaches early, and spends the rest of its run time trying, mostly successfully, to regain its balance. It's lovely to look at and its world is a joy to explore, boots on the ground, but the combat lacks impact and precision, and technical issues mar the experience. Your home for all your videogame needs. Reviews, videos, podcast, news: we\u2019ve got the lot: PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox, PC Gaming!\nAttack of the Fanboy, Within my first hour of playing Biomutant, the thoughts and feelings I had were those of 17 years ago, when I first booted up Fable on my original Xbox. The brand new IP from THQ Nordic, developed by Experiment 101, is undoubtedly inspired from games of the past, in a good way. At its core it is a huge, open-world action RPG with a lot of decision making and even more conflicts between the Tribes and NPCs that inhabit this lush world. Very similar to the title I mentioned above, barely scratching the surface though in regards to the inspirations it has from other games. If you combine Fable\u2019s vibe and freedom of actions, elements of the Batman Arkham series\u2019 combat and Mass Effect\u2019s Paragon and Renegade system, you have yourself the odd love-child that is called Biomutant.You find yourself in a post-apocalyptic Earth, where pretty much everything has gone to waste. Your goal, eventually, is to end the reign of World Eaters, gigantic beasts that are destroying anything that happens to block their path and have proved their dominance over the more civilized creatures. The Tree of Life is what remains as a source of life in this desolate planet, and you will be the only one who can prevent World Eaters from destroying that as well.There are toxic power plants and radioactive areas all over the place. Not to mention the icy-cold locations that disregard any kind of natural laws, or places completely overtaken by unbearable heat. As such, the most hellish environments imaginable. Even if that\u2019s the case though, oddly enough, the majority of the map in Biomutant is full of greenery and beautiful scenery. While yes, there are ruined towns and villages everywhere, past those lie some really pretty places to explore and even wildlife to either tame or just interact with.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da43713b-3eca-4a34-a773-e33f78949c20": {"__data__": {"id_": "da43713b-3eca-4a34-a773-e33f78949c20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2df9d76-bff6-47db-84c0-799eff3a961d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "48ab7512ec98061a6de9d0152b6bdfaae18087c767647966bd61501b86062170"}, "3": {"node_id": "59ed0942-538e-4625-bd23-301acfb4904d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b53ae7719ace22e7639bdfd92a8f414cd0a3c4d9281a9281e4d9d089119a054"}}, "hash": "42c31863427eacb245c171cb50277ea343c7416bba67419b872cbed9e3bfd20a", "text": "When you think of a world where everything reached this state, bright colors and joyful creatures are the least that would pop in your mind.This fact alone makes the world of Biomutant a blast to explore and traverse through. Sometimes you will scavenge for items in deserted towns, while others you will find yourself stuck in a tunnel trying to find an exit, slicing through a bunch of enemies. There will be occasions where you will be having the time of your life riding a mount, traversing through a fascinating forest, only to end up to a drained power plant full of radioactive beings with no other goal than to hurt you. You will even unlock certain vehicles that let you pass through oil-filled hills, or even the sea itself. Those areas have their own dangers and treasures, so if one thing is for certain in Biomutant, is that you will always have this feeling of excitement in regards to what you will bump into next in your adventure.A lot of characters are eagerly waiting to meet you in Biomutant. And I\u2019m saying this quite literally. Your character is a heavily customizable, furry little mammal-like fella, who actually has already built a reputation for himself over the years. In fact, this reputation will be based on your actions throughout your journey and depending on what were they, NPCs everywhere will address you as such. If you go down the let\u2019s say \u2018aggressive\u2019 route, everyone will keep mentioning how much of a threat you are and that even you can have a change of heart further down the line. If you however chose to help people and act as a neighborhood hero, they will all admire you and treat you with respect. Whatever the case may be, as I mentioned, characters in towns and pretty much everywhere will be able to recognize you in the most part, especially those that are associated with Tribes.These Tribes are the game\u2019s factions, and there are six of them in total. Three of them are associated with the way of the Light, while the rest with the Dark side. Or to be more precise, Light and Dark Aura if we want to be on par with Biomutant\u2019s terminology. This Aura is also a part of you and the more actions you take on behalf of one side, you will gather points respectively. Tribes will further boost your tendency towards any of the two Auras, by giving you quests and tasks leaning more to their side. You will be able to join one of the two Tribes that will appear in the beginning, one sitting in the Dark spectrum, while the other in the Light, but as you progress more into the story and you encounter the rest of the Tribes, you may change your allegiance to any of them accordingly. The important thing to note here, is that both sides have different end-goals, which will eventually lead to a different ending. As such, don\u2019t treat the Tribe selection lightly.All of the choices highlighted above, do matter. Every action you take will have consequences down the line, that being a small choice between helping a poor farmer or not, to the bigger ones like which Tribe to join and how to handle their affairs. You will find yourself capturing enemy Outposts, owned by another Tribe, in order to increase your own Tribe\u2019s field of reign. Even if that\u2019s the case though, in the end you may decide to not do this anymore or even spare an enemy leader, which contradicts to a Dark Tribe\u2019s usual behavior of handling opposing threats and vice versa. It really comes down to how you, the player, want to experience the game and Experiment 101 ensured for us to have the freedom of doing so.While most of your time will be spent on exploring vast areas and picking up items from daily-life objects like closets and refrigerators, combat will be the game\u2019s true selling point. Being an action-RPG, Biomutant has the player slicing his way through a great variety of enemies, with very unique abilities and Wung-Fu. There are all sorts of weird Mutations you can unlock as well, that act as offensive tools. You can throw vomit to the ground to poison enemies, spawn a rocky fist from below to send them flying, or even cover yourself with a giant bubble field so that you can trample over smaller enemies and beasts. After all, you are a mutated being, so why not take advantage of it?Your traditional swords and pistols are here as well, but by utilizing the very easy-to-learn craft system Biomutant offers, you can dual-wield a pair of toilet brushes or even throw a barrage of bullets using a trumpet. You find weapon parts by exploring, earning them from quests, or even buying them from vendors which you can then combine to create something completely unique.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59ed0942-538e-4625-bd23-301acfb4904d": {"__data__": {"id_": "59ed0942-538e-4625-bd23-301acfb4904d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb68d001bd2a835d4a0ce678efb5233d544993d9fa9c0709dca9bb3cc6a449d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "da43713b-3eca-4a34-a773-e33f78949c20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "42c31863427eacb245c171cb50277ea343c7416bba67419b872cbed9e3bfd20a"}}, "hash": "2b53ae7719ace22e7639bdfd92a8f414cd0a3c4d9281a9281e4d9d089119a054", "text": "The amount of weapons you can end up with is ridiculous, especially in terms of how they look. They can even have passive abilities implemented to them, if your materials do have one included to their kit. Overall, the amount of tools you have in combat is very generous, and since you can customize your main character to your liking and choose the class you prefer the most as well, there is a ton of different setups you can try out. With five different classes (and one as paid DLC making it a total of six) there will be something for everyone\u2019s playstyle of choice.Combat itself is taking place in real-time, right after you encounter any kind of enemies. You can jump into a fist-fight, use your melee weapon up-close and personal, use your guns for a ranged showdown, or embrace your inner Sith Lord and use your Levitate ability to fly around and shoot lightning bolts. It all comes down to how you want to fight, and whatever method you choose, is equally efficient. I do have some complaints for when you just begin your adventure, since it is obvious that certain types of combat don\u2019t really do well, in comparison to others. Melee combat for example is really lackluster in the beginning, when you don\u2019t have strong weapons or a good variety of abilities at your disposal. More often than not I ended up relying on my extremely efficient gun, which was the reason I could live some confrontations. Let me also add that my character was created and customized as a melee fighter, with a lot of extra points to strength and agility, so it\u2019s not like I wasn\u2019t ready for it.Fortunately enough, this is not the case for long. After you\u2019ve put some hours into Biomutant, the game does speed up a lot. You find items way faster, you unlock a lot of different abilities all the time and you gain levels on a steady pace. After I managed to craft some really good one-handed weapons (a small knife attached to a bone and a suction cup glued on a katana handle), and enhanced them with the toxic and ice element, things were way different. What I realized though, was that it wasn\u2019t the weapons that mattered that much, but the amount of experience I have gathered after a while and the new techniques I had available. Due to how the combat felt from up close, I started using my assault rifle as a main weapon for a good portion of the game. I unlocked some new Wung-Fu and techniques in the process, tried melee combat again and it was a new me. This was heavily satisfying, as I managed to see my progress into this dangerous world, and how much my main character has changed from when I passed that tutorial phase in the beginning.Biomutant is true to its nature and follows the open-world trope by heart. For this reason, it\u2019s hard to talk about every aspect of the game in detail, since it would make this review so long it would hurt anyone\u2019s eyes. That said, I had a good while to experience a game of this genre that I am invested this much to its world and characters, not to mention its brilliant mix of different types of combat and the easy to approach crafting system.Playing Biomutant made me think of simpler times, when I just turned my game console on and started playing without a care in this world, or in any world at all. It was me, my old-school 30\u2033 TV and the game in front of me, nothing more, nothing less. While it for sure has some flaws like a slow start, some combat junkiness at first and a couple of cut-scenes that look low budget-ish, by no means they hinder the end result of this great action-RPG. If these weren\u2019t present, a perfect score could have been very possible.\u00a0This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.\n\nAttack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Biomutant Review", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"0aee3a48-4de0-47ae-9fcc-555cfdc5eca0": {"node_ids": ["dd7f4a00-7997-4244-81fb-960eef25d2e2", "ba439455-d256-4de9-be85-301987685734", "26768ce4-db94-415d-b328-e3355d92690e", "ffc8dfbc-3b81-401f-88be-931f5c0113cd", "fb397a89-0dd8-4cad-b5da-6f16dc668d78", "8ef4278a-d701-45e8-8302-d1aeb739b014", "f00b3f01-9a1d-4ace-b609-51c394ff24b1", "ad2320a7-5485-48da-9d62-e73a5b637a6d", "c6b4c260-91fd-4374-b3e7-a01ee663dbe4", "6a7c5a4b-c438-4b7f-8531-d783496e71c6", "2239faa6-bd73-4e05-a2fb-1ec23890cd69", "9d3f7322-9d19-4208-b1a0-8b20b72d47ee", "53f85958-d70b-435d-8479-b354377839cf", "b56dacd5-350f-473c-b306-59bd3cbcfdbb", "4c2c45ad-94a2-4eac-b9c4-901963f205ec", "0ac6adc8-bfc0-4fd8-8a27-d931707d07e2", "faaa8847-15be-4502-92e9-b0a84615eeb7", "bb1cb277-d9c5-4dba-a9f2-49564c69bdfd", "e95bad8a-2de3-492a-9f7e-5329e58c946c", "baaf777b-11b5-4487-8740-2959e58b4fe2", "9df86dfb-15c0-4d71-b38e-7900ab214872", "c200cd3f-af81-44fc-8a54-187d00abbbd0", "f3ec6da1-c8e7-458b-96b0-acb546263d7b", "848e04a3-e967-40cb-ac34-7c205b0d1f92", "8e9e7aca-7067-4451-9d62-c78b4d5c0092", "5855617d-502f-40d1-9c46-dcea1403ec8f", "bf251623-8104-4f37-bc25-390fe111a915", "f2df9d76-bff6-47db-84c0-799eff3a961d", "da43713b-3eca-4a34-a773-e33f78949c20", "59ed0942-538e-4625-bd23-301acfb4904d"], "metadata": {}}}}
