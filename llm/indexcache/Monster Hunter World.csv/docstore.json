A dragon murder sim with excellent taste in clothes.\nExpect to pay \u00a350/$60\nDeveloper Capcom\nPublisher Capcom\nReviewed on GeForce GTX 1070, 16GB RAM, i7-7700HQ\nMultiplayer 4-player co-op\nLink Official site\u00a0\"When in doubt, burn 'em out!\" sounds like a line from Apocalypse Now, but in Monster Hunter: World your plucky sidekick shouts those words after steering a massive airship into a festering swamp of rotting carcasses. The biome is so large and regularly resupplied from the bountiful coral jungles above that it's developed a unique ecosystem supported by errant corpses fallen from the sky. It is disgusting and beautiful. You've come to make camp, kill the survivors, and make cool clothes from their skin.\u00a0Monster Hunter: World is a third-person action game about dominating the food chain and looking good doing it. It's renowned for its endgame grind, where you go on ever more complex and challenging hunts across diverse, tangled open worlds in search of rare items needed to craft an armor set that\u2019ll no doubt crown you the min-max champion of the world. But Monster Hunter\u2019s essence and greatest strength are its tense, desperate, and tragic fights with beautiful beasts that can go on for the better part of an hour.It is also about the gleeful colonization 'new' lands and the slaughter of native species. Monster Hunter is a grotesque fantasy, but if you can stomach the merciless, repeated slaughter of god's beautiful dragon children, you'll find an excellent, endless action game that tests reflex and intellect in equal measure.Unlike the story, murdering World's dozens of intricately designed monsters has a point. There\u2019s no leveling up and skill point allocation in Monster Hunter, so crafting armor and weapons is the only way to permanently buff your stats. Gear crafted from monsters reflects their strengths and weaknesses, so if you\u2019re having trouble with a thick-skinned fire type, you\u2019d best go take down the thicker, hotter Ratholos for fire-resistant armor, and maybe seek out a poisonous monster for a weapon that does a bit more damage over time. Clear affinities between behavior, aesthetic, and the hard numbers that govern monster stats make deciding which monster to hunt next and which gear you\u2019ll need to ruin them relatively easy to determine, though a few endgame fights might require some careful menu digging.An anjanath 'drinks' a 'health potion'.\u00a0All 30-something monsters (with more on the way via free updates) have distinct personalities brought to life through realistic animation, observable behaviors, and detailed models. My favorite, the Paolumu, is a fuzzy pink and white bat creature that balloons like a blowfish when threatened. The Kulu-Ya-Ku is a big dodo bird that uses big rocks as its first line of defense. The Anjanath, a fire-breathing, chicken-winged T-Rex, would be the final boss in most games. Hitting one until it stops moving for the first time is an immense, sad accomplishment.\u00a0And then a Rathian plunges from the sky and captures an Anjanath in its claws, flailing your former final boss monster around like a ragged teddy bear. Somehow, they get bigger yet, with creatures that resemble fallen, very grumpy gods. \u00a0Gods or dodos, hunts work the same throughout the entire game. You \u2018post\u2019 a quest in Astera, the busy hub area, eat a quick meal to buff your stats, and if you\u2019re playing with friends, you and up to three others embark to a particular biome. From there, you\u2019ll wander an intricate environment in search of your monster. Scoutflies, sentient compass bugs, will point you to nearby crafting materials and monster tracks, always nudging you towards an inevitable fight.\u00a0Problem is, biomes are populated with monsters besides your target, and they\u2019ll probably interrupt your fight. Letting them duke it out while you hide can work in your favor, sure, but staying out of the way isn\u2019t easy. Environmental hazards complicate hunts further. Do you try to lure an Anjanath beneath a massive boulder strung up by vines above?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ed93bf9-b60d-4c69-95a7-d34ef4337ffc": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ed93bf9-b60d-4c69-95a7-d34ef4337ffc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc3cd6e0-ec4a-4f2e-9c57-3edeaff8fa3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "989fbeb3fc0bd86004eff4030c48432147987717a804f759ac962b9c1e157b4b"}, "3": {"node_id": "85a65216-5e07-4384-a889-99f13a4388c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "945082030d8b620076d1a0ece50fc0911c9f1f9d9d4029225cb2b9487bb930e0"}}, "hash": "2316b9eb32a7231ae05ae7fc44709f2cb20c9f0f749a8df4d97d53ee810660c4", "text": "Loosing it with your slingshot could flatten you too.It's like ASMR, but with swords and dragons.\u00a0Monsters have no visible health bar, but they\u2019ll appear tired and increasingly scarred the weaker they get. At certain intervals, they\u2019ll make a break for it and try to find a place to sleep or prey of their own to eat in order to build HP and stamina, turning hunts into frenzied chases. Knowing your environment, where the monster might be headed, and the fastest way to get there only comes with experience.\u00a0When you can walk the line and land a rare, righteous combo directly on a Rathain's scaly dome, the feeling is euphoric.That\u2019s OK because World\u2019s combat is strongest when it feels like a struggle. Swings with the greatsword take literal seconds of animation, the hammer requires getting too close for comfort, and even the mobile ranged weapons feel like unwieldy, clunky machines. I\u2019m partial to the switch axe, a weapon that stores elemental damage in axe form and releases it in explosive bursts after transforming into a glowing sword the size of a teenager.It still looks tiny to a burrowing sand wyvern or electric flying squirrel lizard. Big sword or not, you can and will get poisoned, paralyzed, burned, stunlocked, put to sleep and become subject to every attack your quarry can muster while you're helpless. Swings and shots from your friends can interrupt your own, and your every attempt to exhaust your movement abilities will also exhaust your character. For example, if you jump while sprinting to dodge an attack, your character will always leap forward and fall flat on their face. Remember: this is not your house, and you are very small.\u00a0Combat isn\u2019t fun in the way it is in Dark Souls or Devil May Cry, which reward constant, fluid combos and perfect timing, but it is always tense, and often hilarious. And when you can walk the line and land a rare, righteous combo directly on a Rathain's scaly dome, the feeling is euphoric.But so much gets in the way of that crunchy feedback loop. If the intent of crafting and gear management (the usual downtime activity between hunts) is to make you feel as if you've cultivated food, curated your looks, and performed the proper research required to take down whatever big boy is next on the list, then abstract menu interactions aren\u2019t the most inventive or satisfying way to go about it.\u00a0Not quite a perfect port, World is a deceptive resource hog that likely won\u2019t run at the high framerates you\u2019d expect it to. You can read the full rundown in our performance analysis. But it is stable, and built with PC users in mind. Fully configurable keyboard and mouse controls are as cozy as any controller, and extensive graphics options will get it running just fine on older rigs with enough tweaking. \u00a0When the hunting portion of Monster Hunter is so vividly rendered by massive, believable creatures and lush environments, digging through menus to turn herbs into potions and potions into mega potions lacks the same ceremony. It's fine, in the end, because the menu interactions are streamlined enough that they're not impossible to parse and rarely tedious. Still, for as busy and complex as the crafting and item management appears, it\u2019s painless in practice, simplifying the series\u2019 formerly complex systems to such a degree that they don't even resemble the systems they're simplifying. Why not reinvent them at this point?\u00a0Monster Hunter: World also opens by bashing you over the head with text-heavy tutorials. You'll learn how to craft dozens of items immediately, most of which won't matter until a dozen hours in. Nearly every character in the Astora hub spews text about economies and changing item types, placing the fantasy of preparation on equal footing with filing taxes.\u00a0Vital tips are glossed over too, like how you can use piercing pods to prevent monsters from running away, or how to craft some of the most essential items. I appreciate withholding information from the perspective of a role-playing hunter, where only battle-hardened vets will have obtained the most arcane knowledge.

World changes significantly in high rank play.\u00a0Hunts are remixed by adding layered objectives, like defeating multiple monsters in a shortened time frame or by juicing the elemental abilities of a previously weaker monster. New monsters continue to appear in the endgame, often requiring raid-like planning with a full team of four. As you progress further into high rank missions, small mistakes are met with massive punishments, and the study and preparation for a single hunt might require a whole new armor set and weapon.\u00a0Every weapon has a sprawling development tree. \u00a0It can be frustrating and slow, especially after the breezy hunts of the story campaign. And yet, every challenge is a natural extension of the combat system. Grinding out the best gear for a tough hunt is a smart, often necessary, idea, but if you know when to swing and when to run, you'll be alright.\u00a0\u00a0High rank missions read like an artificial way to extend interest in Monster Hunter: World, but the series has always been preoccupied with grinding for obscure components to make a hat or sword with a difficult hunt in mind. It is Min-Maxing: The Game. Grindy, yes, but the grind is good. With so many modern games competing for time as much as money, Monster Hunter: World avoids feeling like an insatiable black hole by automating the usual busywork.\u00a0Bounties, small collection missions you can often complete during hunts, grant you items and upgrade materials. A greenhouse in the hub area allows you to cultivate herbs between missions, eliminating the need to collect them at all, eventually. The Tailrider Safari is a group of three adventurous palicos you send on missions to retrieve a random assortment of items from specific biomes, softening the need to grind out lower level hunts. And every armor set is unique, pulling in recognizable elements from the monsters they're made of, arranged in eccentric, stylish, extremely anime designs. They are worth the effort.\u00a0Like your character, Monster Hunter: World dresses its breathless combat in every assortment of the most arbitrarily complicated garb, all in the name of variety. It is an abyss of 'replayabilty\u2019, an exercise in patience and observation for the ultimate payoff: an infinite black sea of invigorating dragon murder. And a new hat.\u00a0Monster Hunter: World\u2019s thrilling fights with fantastic beasts never get old, even if they require tiresome item management during downtime.James is stuck in an endless loop, playing the Dark Souls games on repeat until Elden Ring and Silksong set him free.

Like Tobi-Kadachi, the mutant squirrel bastard who'll stun you with the spark in his tail as he leaps from one tree to another, or the fire-breathing Anjanath who'll happily one-shot fledgling hunters. Later, there are the grand towering Elder Dragons that'll knock you this way and that as you whittle away at their generous pools of health on hunts that sap up the best part of an hour, all before you pick yourself up from the forest floor, dust yourself off and, like a kid stepping off a rollercoaster, say to yourself let's do that again.But still, it's the humble Paolumu I've ended up loving the most.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f335882d-af5f-42d9-8172-373b2c9038b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "f335882d-af5f-42d9-8172-373b2c9038b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "85a65216-5e07-4384-a889-99f13a4388c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "945082030d8b620076d1a0ece50fc0911c9f1f9d9d4029225cb2b9487bb930e0"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4cbe6c3-7c32-4c0d-9cc9-857f3870f65f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "003761d1fd63ebdcb55b292af6f2cf1a33b4e41f87d528b0f1952da02cdc8087"}}, "hash": "010e5b4a0c494b6e826d5e02498f1712ae89e44b9ae5d046127e92ab74c2e53d", "text": "A mid-tier monster who prowls the Coral Highlands - a stunning otherworldly tangle of clashing pinks and purples that looks like it's been culled straight from some 60s sci-fi gem - Paolumu is a masterpiece of offbeat imagination told through exquisite design and animation. A cutesy flying wyvern with a neck that can puff up until it looks like a child's swim ring, the Paolumu is a bat/hamster hybrid who's a joy to fight. I spent half a day happily dancing alongside them and repeatedly slaying them, just so I could plunder their remains for a full kit of gear; a fluffy number that serves some campy Barbarella fierceness. There are sturdier, more useful armour sets out there, but that's not really the point of Monster Hunter. It's all about doing things with a little bit of class.And Paolumu gets to the very heart of why I love Monster Hunter; it's silliness delivered with an awful lot of style, and all built around one of the most compelling loops you'll come across in gaming. Hunt monsters and strike them down, so that you might craft trousers from their carcass that'll help you best other, greater beasts whose corpses can then be used to craft more powerful trousers still. Rinse and repeat, until you realise you've clocked up a good 100 hours and found yourself looking at the family cat, wondering what kind of perks you might earn if you skinned them and turned them into a hat.Monster Hunter World, which serves as the foundation for the fifth generation of Capcom's series, doesn't change any of that. At its very core this is the very same Monster Hunter, and in many ways it's a more streamlined affair than we've become used to in recent years. After the dizzyingly broad variety box that was Monster Hunter Generations - itself a compilation of sorts that brought the fourth generation of Monster Hunter to an end - it's even a relatively slight offering. Gone are the Hunter Arts, and there are no new weapons added to the 14-strong roster. In Monster Hunter World, the very kernel of the series goes largely untouched.Which is well enough, really, given how wonderful that kernel is, and Monster Hunter World at least makes an effort to open it up to all. To say it's accessible might be a slight overstatement - it's quicker to get new players into the thick of the action, though it's still just as quick to knock them back on their arses a few hours later and several key systems remain unexplained throughout - so perhaps it's best to say it's undergone a fair amount of modernisation, and now lags only slightly behind its contemporaries.  Monster Hunter World, in a first for the series, is releasing around the world on the same day. There are clear perks to that - and in a neat touch, servers are now global too, meaning we can fight alongside our fellow Japanese hunters - but also pitfalls too. Prior western releases have typically been the 'Ultimate' versions of the game that come a year or so after the original release, complete with 'G-Rank' - Monster Hunter's endgame in which the biggest challenges, and the biggest rewards, are to be found. There's no G-Rank in Monster Hunter World, though that's not to say it's short on challenge or things to do - you're looking at around 50 hours to see through the main campaign, and there are also tougher variants of existing monsters available should you be up for the fight as well as an arena. Capcom's going to continue supporting Monster Hunter World with updates for the foreseeable future, and it seems likely that G-Rank will come as part of some future paid expansion, perhaps to coincide with the PC release later on this year. There's an all-new training area where you can learn the intricacies of the hunting horn, or how to become more effective when wielding the hammer. Out on the field, scoutflies will now guide you to your prey once you pick up their trail, doing away with the headless dance that preceded the majority of hunts in older versions of the game. Progress is now more parsable, with single player and multiplayer combined and a clearer through line piecing together the campaign. The difference between Monster Hunter World and its predecessors can feel profound, though it says a lot about how impenetrable these games once were when the fact you no longer have to look up online what key quests you need to complete to move things forward is something worthy of praise. To say that this is all simply Capcom opening up Monster Hunter to a broader audience is doing it a grand disservice, though. Elsewhere, there's a reinvention of a long-standing series that's just as radical in its own way as Nintendo's Breath of the Wild, and just as effective too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4cbe6c3-7c32-4c0d-9cc9-857f3870f65f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4cbe6c3-7c32-4c0d-9cc9-857f3870f65f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "f335882d-af5f-42d9-8172-373b2c9038b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "010e5b4a0c494b6e826d5e02498f1712ae89e44b9ae5d046127e92ab74c2e53d"}, "3": {"node_id": "da5e5949-ef8e-409b-9391-27c9507ab67c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bac7800bef751f75f67a1c42966ff99898387e3d9e39a2220cdd12eae243bbbf"}}, "hash": "003761d1fd63ebdcb55b292af6f2cf1a33b4e41f87d528b0f1952da02cdc8087", "text": "At the centre there's that same taut combat - communicated with such fidelity it feels perfectly at home on the big screen - though Monster Hunter World's real trick is building outwards. The clue is in the title, really, and Monster Hunter goes to great pains to draw you into its environments. They might not be as plentiful as before, but they're certainly more detailed. Areas such as Wildspire Wastes and Ancient Forest are impossibly dense arenas, offering up seemingly endless warrens it's easy to get lost in. Each map is now one seamless whole, with the loading screens that used to divide individual areas now excised completely.  Each area is now thick with secrets, and with little tricks that can be used to help turn the tide in your favour during any particular hunt. There are traps to be sprung, beasts higher up the food chain to be summoned to help your cause and all manner of tools constantly at your disposal. Monster Hunter World is so crowded with ideas, and so liberal in their disposal, that it maintains the ability to surprise even after scores of hours worth of play.  In Monster Hunter World exploration is a reward in itself, in which you can partake in an expedition - the new open-ended adventures in which you're free to tick off whatever bounties you've picked up as you please, or merely tinker with the scenery - just as eagerly as you might take on a new hunt. It's not quite open world Monster Hunter, but it certainly benefits from a new sense of purpose in its environments. This series has never been short of fantastic beasts and wondrous toys with which to slay them; now it's got playpens that are just as impressive to boot.Like Breath of the Wild, Monster Hunter World is a game that looks towards the west for inspiration, yet it's also one that western games could do well to learn from themselves. At a time when the likes of Bungie and EA are struggling to reward players for their investment in persistent online worlds, Capcom finds itself with something approaching the perfect formula. It's only getting on for over a decade old, but it's certainly never been any better than this. That's not to say it's without its eccentricities, or its faults. There are omissions that will prove controversial with returning players. For fresher players there are frustrations, such as the seemingly binary multiplayer scaling that makes it harder for smaller groups to overcome certain monsters than the solo hunter. There's the clunky menus, and the many systems acquired over the years of Monster Hunter's long history that clatter around clumsily together; there are the appendages and offshoots and dead-ends that can still, despite the best efforts of Capcom in Monster Hunter World, make it all seem infuriatingly arcane.Invest a little, though, and you'll get an awful lot back. The truth of Monster Hunter - and arguably its greatest strength - is that you're never truly its master, and that every player, be they novice or veteran, is always learning something new. Monster Hunter World sees 13 years of evolution come crashing together with some new influences to create a very exciting breed of beast. This has always been a superlative series; with the release of World, it's only become easier to see that's an undoubtable truth. \n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nMartin Robinson\n\n          Contributor\n        Martin worked at Eurogamer from 2011 to 2023.

There\u2019s a potent cocktail of hormones and pheromones to contend with, intoxicating new emotions warring with old, cautionary memories. But sometimes there\u2019s a transcendent moment when you just know it\u2019s true love - a glance across a crowded dinner party, a lingering kiss, heavy with portent, or, in the case of my affair with Monster Hunter World, a massive chicken monster\u2019s yellowed beak suckling raw egg out of a giant dinosaur shell.\u00a0That may not sound like the height of passion, but it was the moment that pushed me from uncertain affection to full blown obsession with Capcom\u2019s latest giant-monster-battling romp.

Gone are the segmented maps of Monster Hunter\u2019s past, replaced by sprawling, seamless regions replete with prehistoric fantasy flora and fauna. This is a world that beckons you, invites you to get lost in it, and masterfully conceals its clockwork mechanisms under a thick layer of vibrant verisimilitude. Monster Hunter has always had an appealing, unique art style, but World pushes it to new levels, aided in part by the power of the current generation of consoles but also by its deft stylistic choices. Each area feels bespoke and fantastical, from the primordial Ancient Forest to the mysterious, enchanted Coral Highlands, to the gloomy, toxin shrouded unbelly of the Rotted Vale.And so I\u2019m hypnotized by the ecology of the Ancient Forest, the first region World deposits you into after its table-setting intro. I\u2019m hot on the trail of the scrawny, crested Kulu-Ya-Ku, down the winding paths of its desert habitat and into the lair of a native herbivore. In my previous attempts to track it, I\u2019d discovered Kulu-Ya-Ku\u2019s three-toed footprints and other signs of its passing \u2014 including shell fragments. It\u2019s part of World\u2019s new scoutflies mechanic, one of the many ways Capcom has tried (and largely succeeded) at making the latest entry more accessible to newcomers \u2013 although there's no shame in confusion, and our Monster Hunter World tips might prove a useful head start.\n\nScoutflies act as diegetic waypoints, and they become more useful and precise the more evidence of a monster\u2019s movements you discover. Eventually, they\u2019ll provide you with clear information about a monster\u2019s location and the best route to them, obviating the old system where hunters would roam a region at random looking for their prey and then go through the onerous process of marking them with paintballs to follow their movement. Like a number of quality of life improvements that World introduces, scoutflies eliminate some of the irritation and busy work previously associated with the series\u2019 hunts without dumbing down or oversimplifying the core elements that veterans cherish.\u00a0Only after patiently tracking Kulu-Ya-Ku, however, do I get a real sense of how integrated the scoutfly mechanic is into the game\u2019s ecologies. After the lanky beast purloins a fresh herbivore egg and is about to smack it open, it catches sight of me creeping around the periphery of the lair and startles. Every monster has different behaviors that dictate their routines and reactions, and many of them will attack a hunter on sight, but Kulu-Ya-Ku is more intent on escaping with its protein prize, so it scurries past me and back out into the scorching desert heat. When I hunt it down later, after a brief chase up some ledges (which can now be more quickly traversed thanks to the slinger, an arm mounted device that fires rocks and other ammunition but is also fitted with a grappling hook) and across a shattered ravine, I find it snoot-deep in that same precious egg, eagerly slurping up unborn dino. When its had its fill and moves on, the discarded egg lays where it falls, a new piece of a dynamic, living ecology and an element to discover and track with scoutflies.\u00a0It\u2019s World\u2019s brilliant world-building distilled down into a powerful, singular (even romantic) moment. The creatures in World aren\u2019t just static boss fights waiting for you to appear and trigger them. They move around the world, interacting with smaller insects and animals, battling one another for territory and domination, hunting for prey or sleeping. And the world changes and shifts to reflect their passage \u2014 a monster scratches its head and the feathers that flutter down become your research fodder, or claws at the ground to sharpen its claws, leaving gouges you can feed as data to your scoutflies. This in turn helps researchers back at your hub (which in World is a complex of old sailing vessels that have been cobbled together into a tiered, makeshift village) build a database of information about the monsters you track, which makes locating them in later encounters easier.\u00a0Eventually, though, the love affair must end - it\u2019s time to hunt. It\u2019s here that Monster Hunter World will be most familiar to those who, like myself, have sunk hundreds or thousands of hours into previous Monster Hunter titles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90d9924b-acc8-4197-b690-1ef7eb13f158": {"__data__": {"id_": "90d9924b-acc8-4197-b690-1ef7eb13f158", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "3620673f-ff51-4fe1-a237-92a3e5f454d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "215607f331ef86b87e73b1a28eb1c193ad404eb397a54779c69fa61f7cab6d4f"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9f511e0-94c8-4ad7-b3fc-e810cb34f7a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed5a888c0398439966c3042e8b0ee19ef9c366addc085308e1080daa42f15904"}}, "hash": "544ada8b20d7f9ce117ca9d57c6840057edd812ae2640808caf4d7ff03106557", "text": "While the combat feels a bit snappier and more reactive than other games in the series, particularly the ranged weapons, which make Monster Hunter feel closer to a proper third person shooter than ever before, it\u2019s still very much the strategic, methodical combat that\u2019s long been a hallmark of the franchise. I tuck and roll around Kulu-Ya-Ku\u2019s vicious beak and flailing claw attacks, carefully searching for openings to pound it with my massive, stone-headed hammer, the occasional devastating strike shattering a critical part of its anatomy and sending precious crafting materials flying off. Targeting those vulnerable, breakable bits of your foes is made easier by the introduction of damage numbers, which change color depending on whether you\u2019re striking a weak spot, and generally give you a much better indication of how effective your attacks are than in any previous iteration.\u00a06 things I wish I knew before playing Monster Hunter WorldThat central loop is very much still present, and as satisfying and deep as ever. Hunt monsters, slay or capture them for the components your smiths need to craft new and better weapons and armor, to hunt bigger and nastier beasts, to craft even more deadly implements and thicker protection. Wash, rinse, repeat. While there is a certain, repetitive groove that it's possible to fall into (and just as much grinding for rare materials as have been present in previous games), Monster Hunter World does an excellent job of breaking up the hunts with a smattering of important story moments, side activities, and clever diversions. And these diversions, as well as the critical story moments and the introduction of new mechanics or systems, are paced extremely well, another way that World strives to welcome newcomers to the complexities of the series without sacrificing depth. \u00a0If anything, in fact, there is more depth than ever before. Alongside the various items you craft from the materials you harvest in the world or from monsters (things like healing potions, food to increase your stamina, or traps to immobilize monsters), there are new specialized tools that add more gameplay options both during and outside of combat. Things like the ghillie suit that let you temporarily vanish while you sharpen your weapons or heal up, or the cleansing station that lets you purge yourself and your party of nasty status effects like bleeding and poison. Then there are the new environmental traps you can unleash mid-fight, to dump heavy boulders on an unsuspecting monster\u2019s head or trap it in a net of vines while you wail away. Instead of the system in previous games, where you\u2019d need to wear multiple pieces of the same armor set to unleash bonuses to things like attack or sharpening speed, now every piece of armor imparts some kind of added bonus, allowing hunters to mix and match in ways that were previously inadvisable. And there\u2019s the aforementioned slinger, which means even melee hunters always have some kind of ranged attack available, with collectible ammo ranging from explosive and fiery to piercing and shattering.\u00a0Monster Hunter World is an incredible achievement. It manages the nearly impossible feat of taking a franchise known (and in many corners beloved) for it\u2019s incredible complexity and depth and making it significantly more approachable, without in any way stripping it down or diminishing it. It tells the most compelling, kinetic story in any Monster Hunter yet (not a tremendous feat, admittedly, but this is a worthy and interesting story) and offers some of the most interesting and addictive action combat in any franchise, bar none. If for some reason you know the core Monster Hunter gameplay doesn\u2019t appeal to you, Monster Hunter World probably won\u2019t change your mind. For everyone else, and particularly for anyone who\u2019s been intrigued in the past but felt intimidated by Monster Hunter\u2019s reputation for opaqueness: buy this game\u2026 and give love a chance.Reviewed on PS4.Alan Bradley was once a Hardware Writer for GamesRadar and PC Gamer, specialising in PC hardware.

All rights reserved. England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, After years of being pigeonholed as a cult classic, Monster Hunter reinvents itself as one of the most exciting new online games of the year.For a series that has been going for well over a decade it seems strange to say that this is Monster Hunter\u2019s big moment, its chance to move from niche favourite to mainstream hit. But that\u2019s clearly what Capcom are hoping for, and the reason for the move from portable consoles to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (and PC later this year). The game is not only the best looking its ever been but considerably more accessible than before, putting it in prime position to become a global phenomenon and not just a Japanese curio.There\u2019s been a great deal of controversy over why this isn\u2019t called Monster Hunter 5, and whether that means that the numbered sequels are still Nintendo exclusives. But Capcom are adamant that this, unlike 2016\u2019s Monster Hunter Generations, is not a spin-off but a mainline entry. And since this will be many people\u2019s first time with the series you can certainly understand why Capcom wouldn\u2019t want to put such a large number at the end of its name.For those not familiar with Monster Hunter it\u2019s a third person action game that was originally little more than a clone of Dreamcast classic Phantasy Star Online. Although World does feature a more traditional plot than anything else in the series, storytelling has never been a focus. Instead, you\u2019ve always been free to explore and hunt however you want, picking up or ignoring quests as you like. The difference this time is that you get to do it all in a proper open world environment.The game starts with an armada of ships making the crossing to the \u2018New World\u2019, using what is essentially medieval technology \u2013 with a few steampunk guns and gadgets here and there. You\u2019re the fifth fleet to make the journey but within sight of landfall you\u2019re capsized by a gigantic Godzilla-like monster, the capture of which becomes the overall goal for the first part of the game.But really, Monster Hunter has always been a game made up entirely of sub quests, where you pick your mission and head off into the wilderness. The old games used to start you off with mushroom picking and other tedious tasks, but World manages to get you up and running much more quickly. And so you find that the primary goal of most missions is to kill or capture a monster \u2013 usually some sort of prehistoric-looking creature or a dragon \u2013 and harvest its parts for rare materials to make more powerful armour and weapons.The game has always featured an open world, in the broader sense of the term, but up until now it\u2019s always been divided up into small sections, with a short loading pause between each. Such is the limit of portable consoles, but thankfully not modern home formats. The world isn\u2019t entirely without barriers though, and you have nowhere near the same freedom of movement as, say, Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. You can jump and swing on vines and a grappling hook, but otherwise you\u2019re a surprisingly ungainly hunter.Breaking up the game world into discreet chunks used to create all sorts of odd tactics, as you ducked into adjacent areas in order to heal or re-sharpen your weapon. Monsters did still follow you, but now they do so in a much more obvious way, upping the tempo of the game and forcing it to allow you to heal and use objects on the go \u2013 something that immediately feels more natural to Western gamers.But the series\u2019 success in Japan \u2013 where it is one of the most successful third party franchises of all time \u2013 is due to its social elements. Not online, but physically playing with other people on a nearby portable. It\u2019s that aspect of the game, more than any other, that never took off in the West and so World instead tries to fully embrace online. As such you start a game by joining a 16-person online session and are free to take up to three other players with you on a quest, or send up an SOS flare when you\u2019re already in one to allow drop-in multiplayer.What results is essentially a sort of melee-based variant on Destiny, including all that implies about repeating the same tasks and missions to gain new equipment. Something you\u2019ll need to do when a mainline quest involves a monster that\u2019s currently out of your league.The other major sticking point for Western gamers has been the style of combat, which can seem very slow when using most of the bigger weapons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1ae7ef8-d01d-4f62-a55d-6cb640305e69": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1ae7ef8-d01d-4f62-a55d-6cb640305e69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9f511e0-94c8-4ad7-b3fc-e810cb34f7a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed5a888c0398439966c3042e8b0ee19ef9c366addc085308e1080daa42f15904"}, "3": {"node_id": "473bbf20-47fc-459e-9712-0e064967c0ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "48822039a79ef1a9b324f39ee4ac4fa59c2a536560fc925cc9b01f8b6a5ef5fd"}}, "hash": "0d476d1ca830371f8a319c73cca9d9c425c3d09937e88cb294b3ff8393aef0ea", "text": "To a beginner it often feels clumsy and, since there are very few combos, surprisingly simplistic. But this isn\u2019t a failure on the part of the game, it\u2019s very much how it\u2019s supposed to be. Dark Souls is a good comparison, not in terms of difficultly but the importance of making every attack count and of being very aware of your surroundings.Learning the tells of monsters and predicting their actions is vitally important, and soon you begin to get a feel for the flow of combat and the almost surgical precision necessary to succeed. Although over the years smaller and faster weapons have been added to the franchise, and there are plenty of options for players that want to play a quicker game. Or you can learn to use the more complex devices, like a transforming axe/sword and an explosive-firing lance.Despite what it might seem like Monster Hunter: World is not really a role-playing game. You can upgrade and acquire new armour and weapons but your character has no stats. Instead it\u2019s your own personal skill that improves as you play, and you learn to master each of the 14 different weapon types. Although beyond that there\u2019s also a huge array of specialist equipment to get to grips with, including traps, ghillie suits, and the cat-like allies whose own armour and weapons you can also customise.But while the game does a very good job of teaching you the basics, with tutorials and a very useful practice area, some of the more obscure elements are not so well covered. The interface is still very fussy and overcomplicated, while the camera lock-on seems to begrudge its own existence. And although the landscape graphics are generally very impressive there\u2019s a lot of object clipping that sees monsters and weapons disappearing through what are supposed to be solid objects.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023We\u2019ll be happy to see further iterations of the game in the future, but all current complaints are forgotten when you\u2019re being chased down by an angry-looking T-Rex, while your three compatriots try to trap and distract him \u2013 allowing you to zip up to a cliff edge, jump on its back and pummel it into submission. And if that doesn\u2019t work you can lure in a completely different monster and get it to finish your fight for you (assuming you can then stay out of its way).This is easily the most important milestone in Monster Hunter\u2019s history. It may not be perfect, but this is the first time we\u2019ve recommended a game in the series without any major caveats. For those of you out there hunting for the next big multiplayer game, Monster Hunter: World deserves to be your next target.In Short: The best Monster Hunter so far, and already one of the most compelling multiplayer games of the year \u2013 with an elegant balance between depth, difficulty, and accessibility.Pros: The seamless open world works great, making hunts and animal behaviour much more organic. Huge range of weapons and equipment, well-integrated online options, and tons of content.Cons: Still some accessibility issues, especially in terms of explaining more obscure concepts.

Many longtime fans thought the quality-of-life improvements and interactive ecosystems were breaths of fresh air, while newcomers wary of the series\u2019 learning curve found a more approachable (though still dense) action-RPG. Five months later, the PC version of World serves a third master - PC players - remarkably well, provided you have a fairly powerful rig.The increased horsepower of a high-end computer allows World to run at an uncapped framerate at higher resolutions, which leads to an overall smoother experience \u2013 if your PC can handle it. While running around Astera and hunting down monsters looks wonderful, these nuanced ecosystems are demanding to render; running an Nvidia 1080 TI graphics card and an Intel Core i7 8700K\u00a0CPU, I was just on the cusp of 60 frames for second at 1440p.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "473bbf20-47fc-459e-9712-0e064967c0ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "473bbf20-47fc-459e-9712-0e064967c0ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1ae7ef8-d01d-4f62-a55d-6cb640305e69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d476d1ca830371f8a319c73cca9d9c425c3d09937e88cb294b3ff8393aef0ea"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbedd278-e8a6-48de-aa24-8ddff0cc9f38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0164564f9821eb50aabe191b19fa1db14e6c66112a4754842f50f836c4eb65a6"}}, "hash": "48822039a79ef1a9b324f39ee4ac4fa59c2a536560fc925cc9b01f8b6a5ef5fd", "text": "Turning the resolution down to 1080p gave me about 20 additional fps, but after comparing the PC and console versions, the visual upgrade isn\u2019t as drastic as some might have hoped for, especially when compared to the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro; up close, many textures look muddy and blurred.The optimized load times are an unquestionable godsend, however. On console, going on a hunt meant gearing up, gathering your party, and going to check your phone or use the bathroom while the environment loaded. On PC, load times are much briefer \u2013 usually less than 10 seconds.Exploring the rich locations for resources and monsters is a fantastic experience on mouse and keyboard;\u00a0after some of the thrilling hunts I've had in the new world, I prefer slaying and skinning monsters with a PC-centric setup. The gamepad control scheme works well, but can occasionally feel clunky if you\u2019re used to other action-oriented controls (Y and B for attacking, for instance). With a mouse and keyboard, a combination of more standard controls (using left and right mouse buttons to attack) and key-remapping feel much more comfortable.\u00a0Being able to look around quickly with a mouse also makes keeping track of nimble enemies (like the Odogaron) much easier. This makes up for the jittery targeting system, which is ineffective in light of being able to simply keep track of monsters myself. I also appreciate being able to remap controls for melee and ranged weapons individually. After not taking to the default bow control scheme, I was able to rework it into something closely resembling a third-person shooter without sacrificing the setup I had going for my trusty great sword.One issue console players had with World was the size of the text and interface. That problem is still around for this port, and while the \u201clarge\u201d text option added post-launch on consoles is available, World\u2019s interface is dense and too small to properly read \u2013 at least when I was on the couch with a controller. When I was sitting at my desk and using my monitor, I had no problems scanning the minimap icons, inventory, control icons, and text.While combat is mostly improved, I wasn\u2019t able to find a comfortable\u00a0way to quickly select and use the exact item I wanted. A new PC-centric \u201cradial\u201d menu option (it\u2019s actually a flat bar) lets you map items to the number keys, but only after pressing the F1 key, and this isn\u2019t remappable. Considering the number keys aren\u2019t used for anything else by default, mapping items to the number keys could have been the easiest way to use a potion then immediately use a whetstone to sharpen my weapon mid-fight.\u00a0The controller-centric radial menu fares slightly better, but relies on one too many key presses to be consistent and doesn\u2019t allow for diagonal inputs. I wound up using the scroll wheel to cycle through my items when looking for a healing potion or antidote in the heat of battle. This isn\u2019t ideal either, as several of the special items clutter up this scrolling process when you\u2019re looking for the one or two items you need. This isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, but it fails to capitalize on one of the PC\u2019s strongest advantages: quick access to multiple options.I spent a lot of my time poring over stats, items, and resources as I managed my flow of items and turned them into powerful armor. The PC version handles most of these tasks well, though the menus weren\u2019t optimized for use on PC; moving items around between my pouch and item box still involves selecting items individually and a series of clicks and keyboard movements, and feels unintuitive with a mouse. The auto-sorting and restock options do a lot of heavy lifting, though, and while I still spent quite a bit of time in menus, it was mostly looking over my upgrade and item options instead of struggling with the interface.While Monster Hunter: World\u2019s co-op setup is arcane at times, it works well on PC. Playing on pre-release servers, I was able to quickly hop into friends\u2019 sessions and hunt with them, answer SOS, and receive some help of my own without issue. The in-game chat option is a bit choppy, but that\u2019s not a big deal with so many third-party options to chat available.\n\nA collection of minor issues don\u2019t quite sour the experience, but still get in the way.\u00a0You can\u2019t skip cutscenes, and you cannot Alt+F4 at any point.

All Rights Reserved.\nGame Informer, The latest game in the Monster Hunter franchise brings the core elements that have made the franchise a cult classic \u2013 difficult battles, fun and interesting progression, and stomping on dinosaurs with your friends \u2013 and opens the door for a deluge of new players with a more accessible sheen. Make no mistake, hearty challenges are still at the center of the experience, so veterans won\u2019t be disappointed with the colossal end game leviathans. In addition to serving up what fans expect from the franchise, newcomers also have a chance to dip their toes in before being shoved out into the ocean and can enjoy a slightly more accessible ramp.Monster Hunter: World is the most accessible game in the series, and funnels new players into the core systems and mechanics over the first 20 hours of the game. The first low rank hours are comfortable and casual, followed by more challenging high rank fare and an expanded armor and weapons system, and then finally, Elder Dragons. End game hunts pull all your skills are put to the test, and hopefully after all the progressive challenges leading up to them you\u2019re ready for some serious battles and top tier rewards. This clear segmentation works incredibly well, providing a linear path that slowly ramps up both enemy difficulty and the underlying options for your gear. By the time I hit credits after around 60, I was eager to get right back into the mix for more post-game fun. The intense task of bringing down an Elder Dragon and reaping the rewards provides a double-shot of dopamine to the brain, and you just want to roll back in and take on another.The progression loop is simple but enchanting. Go out, hunt monsters, use their parts to make new and exciting weapons and armor. As you progress through the game, more customization options unlock along with powerful set bonuses, allowing you to create a potent mix via set pieces and decorations (gem slotting for bonuses).An element of exploration adds to the experience, as you can stumble upon all-manner of interesting things out in the wild, from new Palico tribes and gadgets, creatures to collect and put in your house, and undiscovered monster clues that can lead on a dangerous, wild ride. While each area is its own instanced piece of the larger world, each feels distinct and interesting. Each time you come back to the main city of Astera, there\u2019s something new to engage with as well, like sending out your Palico squads to hunt for you in previously conquered areas, upgrading your food options in the canteen, collecting the fruits of your harvest, or checking out the new goods that come into port via ship.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0The streamlining of certain franchise staples is a boon for both newcomers and veterans. Instead of dealing with annoying paintballs and guessing games during the hunt and chase, scout flies are a great solution. These helpful insects provide a tracking experience that feels natural and immersive as you collect tracks and other clues around an environment that lead to their habitats. Learning more about monsters from tracking, hunting, and capturing fills out your research library in the town hub, allowing you to get a comprehensive look at monster weak spots, elemental strengths, break-off parts, and drop tables. Studying these entries an extremely useful way to learn more about the monsters and your approach to beating them. Picking up useful materials as you run by instead of having to stop is great, and auto-crafting makes annoying activities like refilling your essential consumables a thing of the past.Monster Hunter: World offers 14 different weapon types that embrace all variety of play styles, from in-your-face aggression to long-range bombardment. Weapons are tagged with accessibility in mind, pushing new players toward more responsive equipment that may not require as much setup or methodical combat. But for those who want to show off and put their skills to the test there are plenty of opportunities. A longsword user will have a much different experience than say, the hunting horn, and experimenting with different weapons is a big part of the fun.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9030bb3-7a5a-4741-9e46-e21a51e39975": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9030bb3-7a5a-4741-9e46-e21a51e39975", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "fbedd278-e8a6-48de-aa24-8ddff0cc9f38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0164564f9821eb50aabe191b19fa1db14e6c66112a4754842f50f836c4eb65a6"}, "3": {"node_id": "b6bf1eaf-9131-416d-80ee-47c51987c0d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "77e0ade102e2105c83b63f6e1bc52e4ca3e1b9a6a7d671bbc399961145b60cfb"}}, "hash": "b6a3c370e30a275b29fbf714ed2f9e520b010ecbb33c14b2cbcfff599196b7c5", "text": "Catching up a new weapon to your current \u201ctier\u201d only takes a few battles, so it\u2019s easy to try out a new play style. This adds a good deal of longevity and entertainment to the overall experience.A few quirks drag World down from the heights of greatness. Some framerate issues happen from time to time, creating a jarring combat experience, especially when there is more than one giant monster on the screen at the same time. Sometimes when you have two or three big beasts in the same area, they won\u2019t even really interact or move around unless you\u2019re really close to the action \u2013 which is probably the last place you want to be in that situation. There are a few other minor down points, including one of the story-based battles (that the game has the ridiculous notion that you\u2019d want the opportunity to play it more than once!) being an unfun slog that\u2019s more of a trial of patience than a battle with a monster. When playing multiplayer, you must wait for a friend to complete story-based mission objectives before joining in their quests as well, but in the grand scheme of things these quibbles can be overlooked.Monster Hunter: World is the best game in the series, and a welcoming gateway for newcomers to get in on the tail-chopping, rodeo-riding, and titan-slaying. I never want to play the series on handheld again after this, as the grainy graphics and clawed clutch can\u2019t compare to the redefined experience core platforms facilitate.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer. All Rights Reserved.\nPolygon, Filed under:A Monster Hunter for everybodyTo answer the three most pressing questions around Monster Hunter: World: Yes, its creators have made a notoriously inaccessible franchise into something that, if not totally accessible, somewhat resembles it. Yes, it\u2019s still filled with countless menus and tough-to-parse mythos. And yes, this game lets you be best friends with a cat. Does that mean you  should play Monster Hunter: World, even if you\u2019ve never been able to hang with the franchise before? The game certainly remains a challenge, but one much easier to recommend to all types of players.The Monster Hunter franchise is known to rebuff new players. Liking Monster Hunter, in some player\u2019s minds, is a special dedication, akin to liking cross-country skiing or watching the entire Cremaster Cycle in one weekend. You admire the folks that do it, but you also suspect they might be unrelenting masochists.  Monster Hunter: World guide and walkthroughIn this capacity, Monster Hunter: World, a game designed to be more inviting than its predecessors, is, for a lot of folks, the first modern incarnation of a franchise they\u2019ve long been tantalized with but overwhelmed by. As someone from that group, I\u2019m here to declare that Capcom has achieved its goal.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

It\u2019s still layered with complex systems and still asks its players to invest time and knowledge. But World has sanded down the franchise\u2019s most esoteric edges. You\u2019ll spend more time wrestling with monsters than wrestling archaic control schemes. For all its complexity, the point of Monster Hunter is right there in the title: you hunt monsters. Your hunter, customized on a fairly robust character creator, starts the game journeying to a New World full of gorgeous, lush ecosystems teeming with creatures great and small (though usually just gigantic and angry). Your main foe is Zorah Magdaros, a magma-encrusted beast the size of a skyscraper, but getting an opportunity to slaughter it means tearing through a menagerie of monsters, each distinct and beautifully characterized, gradually accumulating the skill and gear necessary for an epic battle.The game\u2019s story, hinged on Zorah\u2019s movements, is a weak spot, a thin motivation to keep you moving forward. No matter. Monster Hunter is a game of moments, and there are plenty of stand-out characters to meet from the civilized sections of World\u2019s hubs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6bf1eaf-9131-416d-80ee-47c51987c0d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6bf1eaf-9131-416d-80ee-47c51987c0d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9030bb3-7a5a-4741-9e46-e21a51e39975", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6a3c370e30a275b29fbf714ed2f9e520b010ecbb33c14b2cbcfff599196b7c5"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5ceee08-8c81-47cd-b376-9a9ce353c897", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d71dd0217ee168eec77a2bb3e005bacb6ecc7a8eacb5f69cf97f0cdc32896ea1"}}, "hash": "77e0ade102e2105c83b63f6e1bc52e4ca3e1b9a6a7d671bbc399961145b60cfb", "text": "Most of the truly memorable ones are cute-but-deadly cat Palicos, who help you along your way while also shouting a lot of cat-related puns. Monster Hunter: World shrewdly allows its fabulous beasts to take center stage, never letting story or cookie-cutter quest givers interfere with the promise of the game\u2019s crux. Each monster, from the moment you first spot it across a clearing to the point you\u2019ve turned its parts into spectacular armor, is distinct thanks to unique visual designs and many special ways each beast can kill you. I won\u2019t forget the first time a Pukei-Pukei \u2014 a giant, green bird with a cartoonish face \u2014 vomited poison all over me, lolling its massive, pink tongue as a weapon. Or when the turtle-faced Radobaan rolled into me with its pokey armor of five-foot spikes, which I eventually shattered to nubs. The monsters have an uncanny style of movement that gives them life, while also communicating how you\u2019re doing in a fight. Monsters will drool purple slime when you\u2019ve poisoned them, or limp along when you\u2019ve worn them down. The animations couple with a smart, unpredictable AI that won\u2019t stop a monster from chasing you up a tree, running away as you wail on its back, or jumping in to a another monster\u2019s battle, which would usually send me packing until they finished. This feature alone offers so much promise for battles branching in unexpected ways; I\u2019m excited for the inevitable clips on YouTube. Just as the monsters are varied, so are the weapons used to demolish them. There are 14 different weapon classes in Monster Hunter: World, and each feels radically different, as if you\u2019re changing your player class every time you pick a new one. I grabbed the hammer, which I learned from my pre-review was particularly satisfying to use when I built up a charge, ran into battle and unleashed a tornado of swings on the monster\u2019s head and front legs; I also enjoy the insect glaive, a long blade that sews together flowing combos, including one where you can vault over the monster and smoothly transition into an air dash. It\u2019s tempting to master each ranged and melee weapon, though some have high ceilings of difficulty, like the combo-focused charge blade, which transitions from sword and shield to axe, allowing you to unleash stored-up energy. The game does a better job than previous entries of explaining weapons\u2019 basic functions and showing players easy combos, but I still occasionally wanted to hit up YouTube for a tutorial on how to master more complex moves. Of course, seeing how well another hunter handles a weapon is a good lesson too, and one of many advantages to playing the game with a fully stacked party of four. Nearly every quest in Monster Hunter: World works with one to four players. Co-operative multiplayer isn\u2019t flawless. For example, if I have to watch a cutscene on a main story quest, every other player is forced to wait to join the quest until after I\u2019m done. But overall, the transition between multiplayer quests is seamless, meaning players can run through a series of quests and strategize and plan on voice chat in between. This is clutch, since more players open up the game for more sneaky ways of capturing or killing the monster with traps or bombs that are harder to execute on your own.If you feel totally overwhelmed during a mission, World adds an SOS flare, which calls other players into battle. It brings immediate aid, as responding players should join you right away, but I wasn\u2019t able to test it during the review period due to low server populations. There\u2019s also your ever-ready in-game sidekick, your Palico. Not only is this cute cat extremely customizable at the start of the game (get ready to lose 30 minutes customizing a cat friend!), you\u2019ll also craft them armor and weapons that can be tailored to each monster\u2019s weaknesses. Yes, there is an element of playing dress-up with a cute cat, but my Palico Vegas (named for my own cat, of course) pulled me out of plenty of jams, and in my opinion, deserved to look nice while doing it.The streamlined additions to multiplayer are just one of the massive quality-of-life improvements evident in Monster Hunter: World. Many of the other tweaks are evident when I began to tackle all the things needed to maintain and strengthen my hunter. Crafting is a huge element in the game, as you\u2019ll gather plants, mushrooms, berries and more to create healing items, ammunition and traps.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5ceee08-8c81-47cd-b376-9a9ce353c897": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5ceee08-8c81-47cd-b376-9a9ce353c897", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6bf1eaf-9131-416d-80ee-47c51987c0d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "77e0ade102e2105c83b63f6e1bc52e4ca3e1b9a6a7d671bbc399961145b60cfb"}, "3": {"node_id": "141fac97-785a-4ee3-b93b-92ab698686ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38a8c584dc367e2a87ee90047c6d0ae0051a15cca1ff2ad4db09c18e1a6c7f6c"}}, "hash": "d71dd0217ee168eec77a2bb3e005bacb6ecc7a8eacb5f69cf97f0cdc32896ea1", "text": "Gathering used to be arduous, as you\u2019d have to wait for an animation to play out every time you wanted to pick the dang herb used in the game\u2019s most basic healing potions. Now you can quickly grab ingredients as you explore, and you can even set the most important necessities to automatically craft once you\u2019ve picked up the required ingredients, meaning less time in menus when you\u2019re on a quest. When you\u2019ve returned and need to do more serious crafting, recipes with pyramids of required sub-ingredients will let you just craft those without leaving that screen. The other key loop in the game lies in all the armor you can craft, and the massive trees of weapon upgrades available. Most armor comes from harvesting parts from monsters, with some extra bits of ore or bone thrown in for good measure. Each set of armor comes with strengths to different types of elements, but what will surely sway many players between one piece and the next is the look; there are certain sets I still covet. Since there is no feasible way to get a full five-piece set from killing a monster one time, it takes multiple kills to collect all the scales, membranes, quills and pelts required. This could be where World begins to feel like a chore, but instead of making players randomly grind for loot, you\u2019re presented with a plan. A coveted piece of armor\u2019s pieces can be added to your wishlist, and researching your monster quarry, by examining its tracks and other leavings while in the field, unlock information about how you can get the exact piece you need. Want Pukei-Pukei\u2019s quills to create a poison weapon? Your monster research shows you can get them by focusing attacks on that monster\u2019s head.It\u2019s all these elements \u2014 the unpredictability of monster hunts, the variety and challenge of weapons, the fact you can spend more time hunting and less time crafting \u2014 that will appeal to so many types of new players. I knew after I had spent 30 minutes hunting for mining spots in the Coral Highlands, a world that feels like someone drained all the ocean water from the world\u2019s most vibrant aquarium, that I was hooked, especially because those ore chunks would allow me to build an ice-resistant armor needed to tackle my next big game. Monster Hunter: World scratches the itch for complexity, both in hunt for rare gear and skill with its weapons, but this time it\u2019s a game that no one should be intimidated to get into. Monster Hunter: World is still complex. It still won\u2019t hold your hand through parts and may require a few friends for optimal enjoyment. It isn\u2019t for everybody, but if you give it a little time and work, it\u2019s a world worth visiting.

The latest big fish in the franchise's pond, Monster Hunter World, is finally here, and it blows the previous western releases out of the water.For seasoned players, the gameplay loop in Monster Hunter World is immediately recognisable. Your job is a cycle that involves crafting weapons, bulking up, killing monsters, and looting them for materials. However, a well-crafted narrative has not traditionally been a part of that gameplay loop, and that may have been a deterrent for those looking for a foothold into the franchise in the past. Luckily for them, the first major point of difference here from the previous mainline titles is the way that the plot and gameplay are grafted together. A spinoff, Monster Hunter Stories, stepped off the beaten track by introducing a simple yet satisfying narrative, and now Monster Hunter World solidifies that step by using the building blocks of previous narrative concepts to deliver a well-paced experience that spends more time focusing on the bigger picture.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "141fac97-785a-4ee3-b93b-92ab698686ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "141fac97-785a-4ee3-b93b-92ab698686ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5ceee08-8c81-47cd-b376-9a9ce353c897", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d71dd0217ee168eec77a2bb3e005bacb6ecc7a8eacb5f69cf97f0cdc32896ea1"}, "3": {"node_id": "d961a7ed-31ae-487c-957c-934393673c6d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "250011d69bbb8b6bf8fabea91ba31d12a4ea3719abfb3f2d270768b71456620c"}}, "hash": "38a8c584dc367e2a87ee90047c6d0ae0051a15cca1ff2ad4db09c18e1a6c7f6c", "text": "By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Monster Hunter World Video ReviewWhile you spend a lot of time chasing an Elder Dragon that wouldn't look out of place in the movie Pacific Rim, Monster Hunter World's choice to integrate Guild and Village quests into one coherent story cuts out any confusion or ambiguity that new players may feel when it comes to figuring out which quests progress your journey. The fact that everything is tuned for a rewarding solo experience is a plus--it's entirely possible to pump through 60 hours of quests without ever interacting with another player online. And when combined with more intelligent monster AI, facing off against a fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus-like creature on your own makes the stakes feel even higher.On top of the story, which revolves around the mystery of why the aforementioned Elder Dragon has appeared in the game's new region, there have been some quality-of-life changes that ease your transition into the world of monster hunting. Instead of frontloading a lot of text-based tutorials as in previous titles, you now have a Handler who doles out helpful information to you as you progress through zones of increasing complexity. It can feel a bit like having an annoying younger sibling tagging along on otherwise deadly adventures, but her vocal cues and vast knowledge about monster types are helpful when encountering new enemies for the first time. This assistance ceases when you start cutting your teeth on High Rank monsters, but hearing about new skills and immediately putting them into practice in the field is an excellent way to learn about the game from the ground up.Monster Hunter World feels like an open-world game to some extent, with fantastically large maps of a scale that we haven't seen before (both vertically and horizontally), no discernable game-pausing loading screens between zones in hunting areas, and a wealth of beautifully rendered environments to slaughter colossal monsters in. A helpful addition to this new world is the swarm of scoutflies that serve as a way to track monsters and other objectives.Navigating the vastness of those areas without scoutflies would have been incredibly tedious. Once you've located a few traces of a monster's path in a zone, your scoutflies automatically track it to its current location. Gather up enough clues over time and soon your insectoid minions will be able to predict where a certain monster is located based on past movements. This is very useful for investigation missions with tight time frames at higher ranks and sticks to your canon characterisation: a seasoned hunter who understands their prey. Except, perhaps, when said prey glitches through two stories' worth of foliage and can't be attacked with any weapons that you've got on hand. Fortunately, those instances are few and far between.Part of the ability to capitalise on a monster's weakness is the smart use of all the tools in your hunting arsenal, with the most important being your weapon of choice. The Hunter Arts from Monster Hunter Generations have been removed, and the game's focus is solely on your ability to dish out ridiculous amounts of damage using your respective weapon's combo. Light weapons are still the most mobile while the technical weapons are still the most difficult to understand and master, but there are ample opportunities to get experience with whichever blade, bow, or lance you've decided on. Weapon upgrade trees are all viewable at a glance, and the ability to make a wishlist of parts for your next upgrade makes the process more convenient, and helps you decide which expeditions to focus on.Bowguns in particular have received the most notable facelift: it appears that there has been an effort to mimic the kind of playstyle you'd have in a third-person shooter, and this is most apparent when you're firing from the hip with the light bowgun. That doesn't necessarily change the strategy needed; you'll still have to make effective use of environmental hazards, traps, barrel bombs, and dung in order to chase down your quarry. There are now more ways to get a leg up on monsters, which make combat encounters more accessible to different playstyles. Elemental effects are all the rage once more, with weapons boasting essential new perks that have evolved alongside the enemies that you forge them from, and the benefits of bringing water to a firefight is a lesson you'll learn early.Of particular necessity is the ability to mount monsters through aerial combos, or through the slightly less coordinated mad scramble off a cliff onto a creature's back; you're given the opportunity to knock a monster down, which will buy you time to slice off a tail or a claw. While the game will reward you no matter what strategies you take, knowing a monster's weak points is still a must if you strive to upgrade your gear.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d961a7ed-31ae-487c-957c-934393673c6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d961a7ed-31ae-487c-957c-934393673c6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "141fac97-785a-4ee3-b93b-92ab698686ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38a8c584dc367e2a87ee90047c6d0ae0051a15cca1ff2ad4db09c18e1a6c7f6c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4f8efe1d-a580-4b87-b5fc-b1e138546f6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0e50e7e0741307fc79568a28db151009b0eb30e46e7fdff3f9d32ed5e56d533"}}, "hash": "250011d69bbb8b6bf8fabea91ba31d12a4ea3719abfb3f2d270768b71456620c", "text": "It's best to nail down your favourite weapon in the Arena--a mode where you test your mettle with specific gear against a monster that you've fought before.Multiplayer integration is, for the most part, seamless. As mentioned above, there's no distinction between Village and Guild quests anymore, so missions can be done alone or with a friend, and you'll both only have to do it once to complete it. You can start a quest alone in an online session and wait for more hunters to pop in to assist. Alternatively, you can seek out an online session for people of a certain hunter rank, and just go along for the ride if they need a hand with anything. The only qualifier is that some story-focused missions require the leader to either watch a cutscene or discover a monster before others can join.You can be in the same online session as someone else without having to do the quests that they're doing, which is useful for those who might want to keep an eye on a friend who's new to the franchise. Players who are struggling solo can also send out an SOS flare that lets their friends put together a little rescue party to save the day. In the downtime between adventures, you can do anything from arm wrestling to challenging each other's times on the killing leaderboards.Getting together with your mates takes a couple of extra steps compared to loading into a multiplayer session on the fly with a stranger. To play with friends alone, you\u2019ll have to join in on their fun via the friends list on the console dashboard, or by sharing a 12-digit session ID. In a game that\u2019s all about momentum and sprinting off into the horizon at the next challenge, getting your hunting posse together is manageable but slightly tedious. That being said, a few minutes to specifically set up a multiplayer session doesn\u2019t necessarily make or break the game.As expected, Monster Hunter World scales the difficulty up if you're not the only one embarking on the quest. Up to four people can go out into the wilderness at once, and the beta experience has already demonstrated to many how exhilarating group combat can be. The more targets available for monsters, the more unpredictable their movements. This means that while you may have more firepower, it can be harder to lock down a monster that's particularly prone to relentless charging or rapid aggression. Luckily, playing with others gives you the opportunity to try out different weapon compositions, and while unusual weapons like the hunting horn might see minimal use in the solo campaign, its sweet, party-buffing tunes and your teamwork abilities will become crucial to helping your friends take down the most savage of beasts.While it may seem like quite a bit has changed, there's a hell of a lot in Monster Hunter World that's stayed the same. Whether it's the appearance of draconic series regulars like the Rathalos and the Rathian or the presence of tried and true weapons, the roots of the Monster Hunter franchise are strong with its latest release. Apart from the overall sprucing up of graphics and the cutscenes with full voice-over, the standout improvements really come from the simplification of the existing systems in a way that welcomes newcomers without alienating existing fans. A lack of loading screens makes exploration a pleasure, and tracking new and improved monsters through areas as they rank up means that you've got plenty to conquer once the story quests are complete. There may not be any new weapons, and there may be a Hunter Arts-sized hole left in the hearts of players who spent hours getting good at the various Styles. However, the removal of those old mechanics feels less like a funeral and more like a necessary streamlining.The PC version of Monster Hunter World, on a superficial level, doesn't exhibit any critical differences in performance compared to the console versions of the game. While running on the highest display settings, we noticed a marked amount of pop-in during some of the more graphically intensive cutscenes, but it wasn\u2019t enough to be off-putting. Some trees in the distance take a little longer to come to life, but you\u2019re often too preoccupied with killing a slavering, townhouse-sized animal to care. The Hunters themselves also generally appear to have warmer, more realistic flesh tones on the PC, but the overall difference in aesthetic mileage is otherwise minimal.One area where the contrast is stark, however, is in multiplayer accessibility. While the PlayStation 4 version had its hiccups with getting the squad together, those aren\u2019t present at all in the PC version, which makes the most of its integration with Steam to get you playing together in under a couple of minutes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f8efe1d-a580-4b87-b5fc-b1e138546f6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f8efe1d-a580-4b87-b5fc-b1e138546f6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d961a7ed-31ae-487c-957c-934393673c6d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "250011d69bbb8b6bf8fabea91ba31d12a4ea3719abfb3f2d270768b71456620c"}, "3": {"node_id": "b25abfcc-d7a9-4d93-a167-cb55f72262ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ddebbf84aa9d90fd4b0582eb863cbe686e2606a1ac7128023744264aa152590"}}, "hash": "a0e50e7e0741307fc79568a28db151009b0eb30e46e7fdff3f9d32ed5e56d533", "text": "It's refreshingly simple compared to laboriously typing out a string of numbers, or fiddling with the PlayStation 4\u2019s subpar native interface.Another pleasant difference which you\u2019ll notice while preparing for multiplayer missions is the fact that there\u2019s almost no downtime at all. This might vary based on your network and PC, but in our experience the time between posting a quest and having it ready to go when others join was instant. In comparison, the PlayStation 4 version seems to take its own sweet time when preparing quests within both individual and multiplayer sessions. Like the aesthetic differences between platforms, this is relatively minimal in the grand scheme of things. However, an improvement is still an improvement, and the overall quality of life differences in regards to multiplayer on PC are definitely welcome.In terms of how the game handles mechanically on PC, the answer is positive. While PC ports of console games have the potential pitfalls of unwieldy control schemes and unintuitive keyboard shortcuts, Monster Hunter World has gracefully avoided these. The default keyboard and mouse combination works well, even when stress-tested under combat situations that require plenty of frantic directional and dodge-rolling inputs. Using the mouse to control both attack inputs as well as overall steering took us the length of the tutorial to get used to, but it never presented an issue in itself. There\u2019s no need to play Twister with your fingers to execute deadly combos here, though fans of the controller input will likely gravitate to the same for efficiency at the end of the day.Ever since the title was first announced, it was clear that Capcom was gunning for something grander than Monster Hunter Generations. It has succeeded, and this is likely the biggest and best that the franchise has ever been. It's not just the comparative depth of the narrative; it also boasts almost seamless integration between combat systems that were previously incomprehensible for amateurs. The Monster Hunter formula has definitely honed its claws, and all the above factors play their part in making Monster Hunter World a meaningful evolution for the series at large.Monster Hunter World is featured on our list of the best Xbox co-op games.Editor's note: This review has been updated to include our experience with the PC version of Monster Hunter World -- August 7, 2018Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nKotaku, Video games often deal in illusions, proffering the fantasy of control and power even when your meaningful influence is minimal. Monster Hunter: World, the new third-person action game from Capcom, absolutely deals in fantasy. It plucks you from reality and sets you in the domains of exotically imposing monsters that you must hunt. In this game, however, the sense of accomplishment and pride that comes from felling them is anything but an illusion.This review originally ran on 1/30/2018. We\u2019re bumping it up because the game is out on PC today. Check here for more on how the PC version performs. In every Monster Hunter game, you work for your successes, learning about your quarry, tracking it, studying its movements and attacks until you\u2019re finally able to get the better of it. The dragon might have size and power, but you\u2019ve got brains, nerve, and some potions that you crafted from herbs and mushrooms. These games are as much about the thrill of being hunted as about the hunt. Their battles only work because you know these beasts could eat you for lunch.I\u2019ve been waiting for a decade for Monster Hunter to finally become popular outside of Japan, ever since a flu-ridden weekend a decade ago at University where my only company was Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on the PSP. There have always been barriers to entry: a bad camera, boring mushroom-gathering early quests, flummoxing controls that required you to physically contort your hand, nonexistent tutorializing, baffling menus, and portable-console graphics. Each new installment in this series has brought incremental improvements to the franchise\u2019s flaws, but they were all fundamentally built on an engine that looked and felt like it had barely changed since the very first PlayStation 2 game from 2004. Monster Hunter: World is the first true, significant overhaul of the series. Little has really changed about the set-piece battles that have always been Monster Hunter\u2019s main attraction, but by god, everything that surrounds them is a lot better.There are no new weapons here, and none of the fan-pleasing combat flourishes that 2016\u2019s Monster Hunter Generations introduced, though there are plenty of new monsters. (Only a small sprinkling of series favorites like dragon-duo Rathian and Rathalos make an appearance in the main storyline.)

Especially on a Xbox One X or PS4 Pro, Monster Hunter: World looks amazing. The enhanced versions allow you to prioritize either resolution for 4K displays or framerate for super-smooth combat, but even without these enhancements you can see the slaver falling from the jaws of an exhausted Rathian, and admire the motes of dust sparkling in sunlight in the Ancient Forest.

Now, finally, it looks as awesome as it feels to play.There is still an awful lot to learn. Really getting into the nuts and bolts of Monster Hunter\u2014the minutiae of gathering, tracking, bounties and research, investigations, monster carves, weapon techniques\u2014would fill thousands of words. Little of it is well-explained as you play, though written tutorials and a handler character who pipes up with useful hints when you\u2019re actually out in the field make a spirited attempt at helping with the basics. You will still have questions that can only be answered by Google or a more knowledgeable friend. The Monster Hunter community, thankfully, is generous with its ample knowledge, but it is still ridiculous to have to consult wikis or guides to learn what the hell your weapon stats actually mean.Here\u2019s the thing, though: this isn\u2019t actually as big of a problem as it first seems. Monster Hunter: World explains the basics fairly well, and all the rest of the knowledge gradually accumulates from playing, talking to other players, exploring, and hunting. You can easily get through the whole story without knowing a thing about skill charms or weapon affinity. Meanwhile, you discover where to find useful plants and bugs and ores by spending time out in the wilds, gradually filling up a map with icons that tell you what\u2019s out there. The more time you invest, the more knowledge you will glean. After 30 hours there is a lot I still don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve still barely found any of the many camp sites hidden in the four giant environments.The challenge with previous Monster Hunter games has always been getting to the point where you want to learn more. This is where World is most significantly improved. The older games were slow starters. World, however, wastes no time in throwing you into fights against impressive creatures, and it looks so beautiful and controls so well that it\u2019s easier to get invested. A quick quest turns into two. Responding to an SOS flare gives you a quest reward that opens up a new set of armour. You spend another hour or so seeking out that elusive last material to forge a new Charge Blade. Then you want to try it out in another fight. It is eminently bingeable.The things that have been simplified are things that were needlessly time-consuming in the first place. New Monster Hunter: World players will never know the pain of hand-crafting 10 pickaxes from bones and rocks, then having all of them break during a single 20-minute mining quest. They will not know the meditative pause whilst waiting patiently for seconds-long animations to play out every time they gather a herb. I don\u2019t miss that nonsense one bit. What hasn\u2019t changed is hunting monsters with beautifully balanced weaponry, and that was always the point.The secret of Monster Hunter\u2019s combat is that even when you don\u2019t really know what you\u2019re doing, you don\u2019t feel like a clown. The most inexperienced hunter could still land a couple of hits with a big weapon like a greatsword, even if it takes 45 minutes to fell a monster. Better players can do things more efficiently. The game rewards skill and witnessing a top player at work in a Monster Hunter will likely motivate you to improve.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2163f0ec-0558-45b0-a98f-c73ee559a7c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2163f0ec-0558-45b0-a98f-c73ee559a7c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b25abfcc-d7a9-4d93-a167-cb55f72262ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ddebbf84aa9d90fd4b0582eb863cbe686e2606a1ac7128023744264aa152590"}, "3": {"node_id": "37a3a8db-86b5-47c0-9ebd-ba4399776c15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f39af4b0d4ca31096d6838bcab7ab70826b818f30cd49bd781f944c386aed227"}}, "hash": "d4d9cb7f6e3b2caf621cca652e05d515632a501d52d8dd2e03f6117a5aa93fd3", "text": "When you see an expert player at work with a glaive or dual swords, dodging away from the tail of a dragon a fraction of a second before it sweeps them off their feet, then retaliating with a five-hit combo... it looks positively choreographed.I\u2019m accomplished with Gunlance and Switch Axe: respectively, a massive lance that delivers shotgun blasts from its tip, and a transforming axe that becomes a sword and can also discharge a close-up explosion with its most complicated combo. For this new game, I decided to learn some new weapons. As the hours went by and I familiarized myself with nimble Glaive and heavy-hitting Hammer, I noticed how my scrappy little opportunistic combos became flowing sequences of strikes, timed perfectly to fit into the gaps between bad-tempered dinosaurs\u2019 attacks. I started to feel like such a badass, leaping onto a fire-breathing T-Rex\u2019s head and blasting it with the axe, my teammates muttering \u201cniiiiiice!\u201d into their headsets. As your skills, weapons and armor improve, you can slaughter monsters that used to terrify you in ten minutes. It\u2019s such a satisfying progression.Enumerating Monster Hunter: World\u2019s features doesn\u2019t tell you much about why it\u2019s so easy to love. It is at once silly and stylish, comedic without being self-conscious about it. At the canteen in the game\u2019s hub, a one-eyed cat-chef serves up a sizzling platter of meats with piratical swagger, theatrically placing the final garnish atop a fresh-caught fish. A little pig follows you around whilst you stock up on provisions and bounties, and a tutorial prompt mysteriously promises that \u201csomething good\u201d might happen if you scoop him up and carry him around like a baby. Other players\u2019 customisable Guild Cards show them reclining mock-sexily in extravagantly ridiculous armour, their feline companion imitating the pose. As with previous Monster Hunter games, you can hunt monsters with up to three other players. If you hunt solo, you\u2019re accompanied by a cat-pal who is a constant source of amusement, bravely thwacking at a wyvern\u2019s legs with a weapon shaped like a ukulele, meowing away, occasionally appearing mounted on the back of a smaller dinosaur or in a little inflatable dinghy.The ludicrous armor sets are a strong reason to play Monster Hunter: World. \u201cI look like a shit Groot cosplayer,\u201d said a friend of mine in dismay upon finally completing his Barroth set. I spent half the early game in a pair of stupid sunglass-goggles, which amused me so much that I kept upgrading them instead of forging new, more powerful armor. One of my favorite monsters, the floaty, fluffy Paolumu, yields a faux-fur outfit so tempting that I immediately wanted to fight it again so that I could craft a puffy hat for my cat-pal.New players will find the game\u2019s main story mode a healthy challenge. For players who\u2019ve made it through a few Monster Hunter games before, it\u2019s unlikely that the story quests will kick your arse. There were only two that had me exhaling slowly whilst looking at the \u201cQuest Failed\u201d screen, and yelling in triumph when I landed the final blow. The story itself is pretty nothingy; the cutscenes are stylish but the plot lacks substance, and the more cinematic climactic mission was a total let-down compared to the freeform, tense one-on-one expeditions that led up to it. Once that final cutscene plays, you come to realize that the entirety of the story is really a warm-up for High Rank quests, where all the hardest monsters are lurking alongside powered-up versions of the beasts you despatched before. I\u2019m in no hurry to rush through them.Already, World has welcomed millions of people into the fold, and with extensive planned support from Capcom, it\u2019s a game that could go all year. (Update 8/09/2018: Seven months later, Capcom has indeed supported the game. Read through our extensive coverage of the new events, monsters, and other additions.) There are problems with the online functionality that Capcom would do well to fix in patches: matchmaking and questing ad-hoc with random players is easy, but if you want to hunt a specific monster it\u2019s annoying to dive through menus to search for exactly the quests you want. If you want to invite players to your squad to play regularly, you have to both be online and in the same session at the same time, which requires a lot of coordination outside of the game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37a3a8db-86b5-47c0-9ebd-ba4399776c15": {"__data__": {"id_": "37a3a8db-86b5-47c0-9ebd-ba4399776c15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2163f0ec-0558-45b0-a98f-c73ee559a7c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4d9cb7f6e3b2caf621cca652e05d515632a501d52d8dd2e03f6117a5aa93fd3"}, "3": {"node_id": "f201f63a-89d9-4a4e-b056-404f31a66fed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa4591272cad70a9addefb3143de61f431c36203e758a5685d2215b1d34cce6d"}}, "hash": "f39af4b0d4ca31096d6838bcab7ab70826b818f30cd49bd781f944c386aed227", "text": "Xbox One players have reported frequent disconnects, though this is something I haven\u2019t experienced at all on the PS4.

It\u2019s just so much easier to appreciate now. What once felt like a well-kept secret amongst players with enough time and energy to scale the barriers to entry is now easier for everyone else to enjoy, thanks to a top-to-bottom overhaul that has made Monster Hunter: World the most beautiful and exciting game in the series. The depth remains, but many of the fiddly irritations that have been holding this series back have been swept away. As a long-time Monster Hunter player, it\u2019s a wonderful thing to witness.\nUSgamer, Monster Hunter's return to consoles is a confident, barnstorming series best.In many ways the Monster Hunter series was ahead of its time. Though the fairly similar Phantasy Star Online predates it, Monster Hunter's 4-player co-operative action RPG design and the treadmill of hunting for drops to get better gear has a whiff of that which has recently made Destiny so compelling about it. That makes now the absolutely perfect time for Monster Hunter World, the series' big-budget return to platforms that can properly support this design with a near-constant internet connection.The result is exactly what you'd expect: the same exciting-yet-methodical monster-smashing combat atop a game that is now wired up in a manner that's designed to keep its already satisfying loop of combat, upgrade and preparation even more fresh. This is a game where login bonuses, limited time events and drop-in, drop-out multiplayer sit happily alongside the same old hardcore beast-hunting action, now also bolstered by a narrative that's delivered in a fashion more befitting of a high-profile console game. \n \nThis rebuilt vision of Monster Hunter feels like a truly smart, forward-thinking improvement to the series. It's an impressive leap forwards.If you're a fan of Monster Hunter's previous outings this might initially be a little shocking. When the game gets going and within five minutes you're clambering atop a beast the size of a small town it all feels a little alien. This isn't for those people, of course, since while they might appreciate it this exists mainly to draw in fans of the more bombastic, story-driven role playing games that are far more common on console. Very quickly, however, World reasserts its true identity. It is still Monster Hunter as all hell.Monster Hunter is stripped back to its very core here - and when rebuilt, it has been done so without many of the foibles and series conventions that made it difficult to approach. Beefier hardware allows for areas to now be one seamless zone, which in turn led designers to make healing a more simplistic affair. Hardcore fans bemoaned that you can now heal while moving, but this is a compromise, since the series' typically unforgiving nature is instead present in how the health bar gradually refills as you drink your potion. If you're hit midway through a drinking animation, the potion is consumed but the bar stops filling, part of your precious restorative wasted.Little touches like this run through Monster Hunter World as its very foundation, and this rebuilt vision of Monster Hunter feels like a truly smart, forward-thinking improvement to the series. It's an impressive leap forwards. Much of what made it great is still there, such as the fourteen different classes of weapon each with their own unique abilities and often quite considered method of combat. If you want to dive in learning outrageous combos you can, but combat is also made approachable with more simple weapon options that'll instead let less confident players focus on the other major star of this entry, the world itself. \n \nDepending on who you ask at Capcom, the World suffix of this game's title has a few different meanings. For one it's a series first worldwide release. That release also reflects a wider development philosophy - to make a game that might have broader appeal outside Japan, something previous entries have struggled to do. I like to think the real reason is the world itself, however - that's the star of the show, with each area of the game as alive as the beasts that roam it.Each of Monster Hunter World's zones is teeming with detail, from the five main hunting areas through to the endearing, pleasant hub area of Astera. When you're out hunting the world is your greatest ally, filled with loot that can be crafted into helpful items and even helpful creatures and environmental hazards that can be used to trap your targets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f201f63a-89d9-4a4e-b056-404f31a66fed": {"__data__": {"id_": "f201f63a-89d9-4a4e-b056-404f31a66fed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "37a3a8db-86b5-47c0-9ebd-ba4399776c15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f39af4b0d4ca31096d6838bcab7ab70826b818f30cd49bd781f944c386aed227"}, "3": {"node_id": "015e15f7-dc83-42a8-b07e-7aa0ba2ac53b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bdce3f6cb01a8e800ada28d09a4532ce0a037e3b1cfc088ecad8182367415a89"}}, "hash": "fa4591272cad70a9addefb3143de61f431c36203e758a5685d2215b1d34cce6d", "text": "If you're really stuck one of the most thrilling things to do is to turn nature against itself by luring large boss monsters into each other's paths to cause a ferocious battle. While Monster Hunter World looks lovely visually, this is where the extra horsepower of the consoles seems to truly go - into artificial intelligence and interesting systems that interlock and interact in ways that have even left the developers surprised. Sometimes the little touches of that world are what surprise the most - the things you can barely notice. There's some sublime audio work going on in the background, and hardcore fans who want to turn off damage numbers and other display elements will find plenty of visual and aural clues as to how they're doing in battle. Speaking of combat - streamlined though many areas of World are, the series' methodical, carefully-paced but energetic combat remains, placing a constant emphasis on learning the behaviors of enemies so you can time your attacks and position yourself accordingly. When things go well, it feels sublime. A highlight are the blunt force weapons - the sense of weight and impact when they hit home really is something to behold. \n \nThe manner in which Capcom has balanced out the needs of their existing hardcore fans and newcomers is admirable and impressive. There's no messing about at the onset - after some typically chipper story exposition, you're thrown into things. Here are the three or four places you need to know about in the hub area - off you go to hunt. There's few intrusive tutorial screens, so if you know what you're doing or are just feeling confident the on-ramp to get into the actual game is remarkably short. Crucially, however, if you want help it's never far away and has never been better.If you know what you're doing or are just feeling confident the on-ramp to get into the actual game is remarkably short. Crucially, however, if you want help it's never far away and has never been better.You can now try out weapons and practice with them in a new training area, and it's easier than ever to earmark things you want to craft, see what ingredients you need for new gear or upgrades and see what you're going to look like once you equip it. Out in the field your Scoutflies act as a sensible compromise for gathering and tracking, taking on the form of green aura that highlights items you can interact with and once you've found enough clues out in the environment will begin to lay out a Fable 2 style glistening breadcrumb trail that'll lead you right to your target.There's a decent selection of old and new monsters on offer to hunt and capture, and though this isn't the largest cast of beasts in the series Monster Hunter World makes up for that with its sheer sense of scale and ambition. It feels like there's more variety to anything you might attempt at any given time, and the newly beefed-up story is a decent-quality narrative that's characterful enough to entertain but not so heavy-handed that it distracts or detracts from what the series is really about, which is that core loop and the systems that make it work so brilliantly. \n \nStrangely enough, one of the few flaws in Monster Hunter World relates to one of the areas with the most exciting potential - online play. The game facilitates drop-in, drop-out play, but it's not quite that simple, with a system in place where players must have experienced all the cutscenes in a mission on their own before they can join another player or have any other players join them on that same mission. This means either soloing the mission first time out or heading in, seeing cutscenes, backing out and then going in with your party - it feels pretty clumsy.This is a one-time issue for the main story assignment missions, however, and the other online features such as the SOS flare work fine once you've pushed past this little wrinkle. Monster Hunter World is really designed to be played with others once you get to the higher-rank, high-ticket items - while you can solo much of the game, the heart of the game is in tackling its co-operative content as a well-oiled team. This entry keeps that intact, and even with a few bumps in the road online is far easier than the hoops one had to jump through on handheld machines. The truth is, Monster Hunter has always been brilliant - but it's always been niche. Monster Hunter World feels like the right game to finally crack that - a game that makes smart changes that might finally mean that a wider audience will at last fully understand, experience and enjoy that brilliance. It's not without a few minor flaws, but it's an excellent, satisfying game - and an incredibly easy recommendation to all, not just hardcore fans.Version tested: PS4, on a PS4 Pro.\nDisclosure: Advance copy provided by the publisher.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "015e15f7-dc83-42a8-b07e-7aa0ba2ac53b": {"__data__": {"id_": "015e15f7-dc83-42a8-b07e-7aa0ba2ac53b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "f201f63a-89d9-4a4e-b056-404f31a66fed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa4591272cad70a9addefb3143de61f431c36203e758a5685d2215b1d34cce6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "b061e651-0cda-430a-8e37-f664ab0bcbd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4cadf2a3449e72280ce376a6374e60915be1cf907c37504f86d1b089a42d2765"}}, "hash": "bdce3f6cb01a8e800ada28d09a4532ce0a037e3b1cfc088ecad8182367415a89", "text": "Disclosure: Advance copy provided by the publisher.

While the series has performed well in its native Japan since its inception, certain aspects have prevented it from being a smash in other territories. That trend started to change with the last few entries on the Nintendo 3DS selling over a million copies apiece in the United States, but it wasn\u2019t until this latest release that the series is finally in a form that makes it approachable for a broader range of gamers.Monster Hunter World is the first main game in the series since Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate was released in 2012 to release on a console. As much as I love the Nintendo 3DS, it\u2019s plain to see that the franchise needed to move to a more technically capable platform to flourish, and Monster Hunter World uses the increased horsepower of the PS4 and Xbox One to craft a much more intriguing and engrossing world than what we\u2019ve seen previously.Practically every system of the game has been upgraded over the last 3DS entry (Monster Hunter Generations), and it\u2019s just so much more appealing to play. The New World, to which your hunter is called to explore and tame, is gorgeous, and each animal, from the lowly insects to the gigantic Elder Dragons, have their own unique look and animations that fill the game with character.The most prominent improvement in my eyes though is the loading. In the Nintendo 3DS Monster Hunter entries, you had to load between each area of a region, which didn\u2019t lend itself to major hunts across a lot of territories. In Monster Hunter World though, you can bet you\u2019ll cover a ton of ground tracking and fighting each of your targets.It\u2019s the hunts that take center stage in this game, and all aspects of Monster Hunter World exist to serve this purpose. As you progress through the plot, each large monster you encounter more or less keeps parity with you, so each new species you battle makes for an exciting foe. The plot itself is, well, it\u2019s there. You don\u2019t have to worry about it much, and it mainly serves as a catalyst to propel you into the new world and give you a reason to hunt new monsters.This game does something I\u2019ve rarely seen before in that you spend so much time on a hunt that you start to feel like you know a monster. Considering it can take 30-40 minutes just to down one foe, you begin to think of them as living creatures who are part of their habitat instead of just some AI enemy for you to cut down.Sometimes I felt sorry for monsters as I took them down, like the ridiculous Kulu-Ya-Ku, a strange bird/dinosaur creature that is the Jar-Jar Binks of the game. At other times, by the time the fight was almost won I savagely hated these infernal beasts. For example, the damn Tobi-Kadachi with its quick movements and lightning attacks had me cursing it until I finally took it out.The basic gameplay loop consists of hunting down a large monster so you can use its body parts as material to make weapons and armor to hunt down more powerful monsters. (Almost) every large monster has its own armor set, and each upgrade of your weapons takes parts from more and more powerful monsters.This isn\u2019t a game you can ignore your equipment in because all of your stats are derived from it. You can\u2019t power level and hope to beat the game with Iron-level weapons because your character doesn\u2019t have a level. Instead, you\u2019re forced to scour the New World for fauna and flora that will enable you to discover and build increasingly powerful weapons.The item gathering aspect is probably the part of Monster Hunter World that will turn some prospective players off the most. Some items you\u2019ll be able to gather in the same spot over and over, while some are only obtainable by carving them from dead or captured monsters, or in bonus items from a hunt. Luckily you can gain a record of what items are available from each monster by researching them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b06b4d1-47cf-4e58-a9d1-ba47a44aca80": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b06b4d1-47cf-4e58-a9d1-ba47a44aca80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b061e651-0cda-430a-8e37-f664ab0bcbd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4cadf2a3449e72280ce376a6374e60915be1cf907c37504f86d1b089a42d2765"}, "3": {"node_id": "41b80496-1b72-457e-be37-2f92234a054f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "88e28d7fa2f6f3675f5cc4c86366d6e811301ea4b41a8254839a01a1e48df654"}}, "hash": "33f73c83dcd0d0f7520b413a44f40530cf68115e95bf9a919c24a65ebd915e4d", "text": "Luckily you can gain a record of what items are available from each monster by researching them. In Monster Hunter World, each creature leaves its mark on the environment.So, if you\u2019re hunting a Great Jagras, a gigantic lizard, you\u2019ll find footprints and scratchings throughout the area its traveled. By examining these, you gain research points (and find the location of the creature). The more research points you accrue, the more bonuses you earn concerning a monster and one of those includes an entry in a guidebook telling you what items the beast contains. Fortunately, by \u201cbreaking\u201d the body parts of creatures by attacking them repeatedly, you can increase the chance of specific items dropping. However, I can\u2019t say there haven\u2019t been times that I spent 30 minutes or more hunting a monster for an item I needed to craft my next weapon or armor only to have it not appear, which can be incredibly frustrating.Since combat is such a large part of the game, it\u2019s a good thing that it\u2019s incredibly satisfying. There are 14 different weapons types in Monster Hunter World, and each has its own way of handling that makes it unique. You can\u2019t just pick a weapon at random and start hacking-and-slashing your way through whatever moves. Each type of arm has its own unique abilities and combos that give the game a Dark Souls feel as opposed to handling like Devil May Cry or a more fast-paced game. You have to be deliberate in your attacks and know the strengths and weaknesses of your weapon of choice to hunt successfully in this game.As you play, you\u2019ll likely try all of the weapons once, and you should. Each player is going to find a core group of weapons they\u2019re happy with and stick with them. With the resources and time sink crafting or upgrading weapons takes it\u2019s only feasible to equip yourself with two or three types anyway. During my playthrough, I stuck with Long Swords (katanas that typically look a lot like Sephiroth\u2019s Masamune) and Insect Glaives.Long Swords pack a punch but allow you to still be mobile at the expense of the ability to guard. Insect Glaives are quick, will enable you to attack and evade from the air, and give you access to various Kinsects that allow you to use unique buffs for yourself or debuffs for your enemies. However, Glaives also lack the ability to guard, and individual attacks are weak.Your experience with the weapons system might be completely different though. You may hate the Long Sword and Insect Glaive and instead become an expert with the slow, but mighty Great Sword, or the versatile Sword and Shield. I couldn\u2019t get the hang of those, but that\u2019s another of the extraordinary things about this game, it rewards you for finding your niche and sticking with it.Monster Hunter World has a high focus on multiplayer, but its implementation is so bizarre I spent most of my time in the game hunting alone. What would have been great is persistent drop-in/drop-out sessions. The hub of the game, Astra, is geared perfectly to have multiple players inhabiting it at once, and its scale is such that it feels like an MMO town with plenty of room to run around in.However, that\u2019s not the case. Instead of getting it chill with your friends on and off the hunt, you can only have other players join you when you\u2019ve accepted and posted a quest. You have to invite a friend, then post a quest, then they have to go to the quest board in their game and join your quest. If you (or they) haven\u2019t watched the cutscenes for that quest, they can\u2019t enter it. So, once you have both watched the cutscenes, there\u2019s a lot of waiting, you do the quest, then you both return to the hub. If you want to go on another quest, one of you has to post it and then join it again.Paul\u2019s feature on just how convoluted and odd the co-op multiplayer system is in Monster Hunter World goes into more depth about just how weird the whole thing is, and he draws the same conclusion I do. If you want to play with other people, you\u2019re better off starting a hunt and using an item called an SOS Flare which sends a call out for players to come help you. This bypasses the whole quest board convolution and gets someone right into the game with you.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41b80496-1b72-457e-be37-2f92234a054f": {"__data__": {"id_": "41b80496-1b72-457e-be37-2f92234a054f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b06b4d1-47cf-4e58-a9d1-ba47a44aca80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33f73c83dcd0d0f7520b413a44f40530cf68115e95bf9a919c24a65ebd915e4d"}, "3": {"node_id": "95d47b27-de4d-4e57-b0a1-5d7031e8f875", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d13fc7c658e8852daf9e7544f10fb57e73a4f0da3d6bad004cdfa51f6549c64"}}, "hash": "88e28d7fa2f6f3675f5cc4c86366d6e811301ea4b41a8254839a01a1e48df654", "text": "This bypasses the whole quest board convolution and gets someone right into the game with you. Some quests, namely the optional ones like investigations make things a bit easier, but for a game with a focus on co-op, Monster Hunter World makes it a time-consuming and unfulfilling experience.Hunting the beasts of Monster Hunter World was an enthralling adventure, and there\u2019s just so much content in this game that a review can\u2019t hope to encompass it. There are so many systems, side quests, and nooks and crannies this game has that I can\u2019t do it full justice here. You can catch animals to be your pets and watch them in your room; you have a feline pal called a Palico who comes with you and helps you on your way and is the most adorable, and so much more.Monster Hunter World is bursting with content and is a game that you can easily get over 100 hours in. The downside is that a lot of those 100 or more hours will be by your lonesome. While as a single-player game this title excels, the multiplayer matchmaking can be incredibly clunky and inexplicably doesn\u2019t allow you to stick by another player\u2019s side persistently. However, in a world so vibrant and full of wonderous monsters and environments, questing by yourself is an immensely satisfying experience and once you get the hang of what you can and can\u2019t do in multiplayer, you\u2019ll have plenty of fun with other players. This is the Monster Hunter game that will finally solidify the series in the West in the way it has been in Japan for over a decade and is a terrific experience from start to finish (if you ever truly get finished).9Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

That hasn\u2019t change a lot in 14 years, but Monster Hunter: World\u2019s sleekness makes it a whole lot easier.Monster Hunter: World\u00a0(PC, PS4 [reviewed with a PS4 Pro], Xbox One)\u00a0Developer: CapcomPublisher: Capcom\u00a0Release: January 26, 2018 (PS4/Xbox One) / TBA (PC)MSRP: $59.99Despite some concessions best epitomized by fireflies (known here as scout flies) assisting in lighting the path to your prey, this is still very much the same punishing Monster Hunter. There\u2019s lots of repetition stat-studying and grinding, all so you can get one piece of coveted armor at a time. That\u2019s basically been Capcom\u2019s philosophy on the series for over a decade: give \u2019em incremental quality-of-life upgrades that are usually standard in other games (lock-on being a highly contentious addition for some reason) and keep the old school base intact.That\u2019s mostly worked for me, having played most of the series throughout the years, but at some point around Monster Hunter 4 I yearned for a new coat of paint. Most iterations, including the myriad \u201csuper\u201d editions over the years, just felt too similar to one another. World\u00a0finally overhauls nearly everything from an artistic standpoint and brings it into the current generation. The main camp of Astero looks stunning and picturesque, like a fully-realized Rufio camp from Hook. Each location, from the lush Ancient Forest to the desolate Rotten Vale, differentiates itself from the pack. But World doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of heart and silliness to it all too, perhaps best encapsulated by the classic absurd Palico (read: cat) cooking sequence.The shift to more open maps makes everything feel like less of a corridor simulator without moving directly into the rote \u201cmap full of icons\u201d open-world setup that\u2019s commonly found in a lot of western games. There\u2019s still going to be repetition in the sense that you\u2019re re-visiting the same areas, but World\u00a0generally does a good job of mixing up the enemy layouts or times of day to freshen up repeat excursions. Bringing back expeditions, which are free-roam sessions with no time limit or requirements, was a good decision.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95d47b27-de4d-4e57-b0a1-5d7031e8f875": {"__data__": {"id_": "95d47b27-de4d-4e57-b0a1-5d7031e8f875", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "41b80496-1b72-457e-be37-2f92234a054f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "88e28d7fa2f6f3675f5cc4c86366d6e811301ea4b41a8254839a01a1e48df654"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb7303ff-920c-4cfa-89d7-2f8145eec325", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2fc637b4a953f10c0975fd3f6b0b0616c4bfb2a96bbe448d71430f589dd5e7f"}}, "hash": "2d13fc7c658e8852daf9e7544f10fb57e73a4f0da3d6bad004cdfa51f6549c64", "text": "They\u2019re an excellent way to remove some of the stress of the standard Monster Hunter\u00a0grind with activities like fishing and capturing, with unlimited lives.World\u00a0still has that rewarding conquest loop. I got my ass kicked by a T-Rex, so I basically re-evaluated everything that led me to the moment where he burned me to a crisp. I swapped weapons (which is easy to do since you can downgrade and get your materials back), upgraded a few armor pieces, crafted some more items, grinded out some ingredients for nutrients (potions that increase your max health), and ate some Good Food. Bam! Dude was dead.Boss fights still range from epic, larger-than-life confrontations against insurmountable creatures to mild tedium. While the larger romps are mostly engaging battles featuring ghoulish designs only the Monster Hunter\u00a0team could come up with, some of the medium-to-large-sized denizens annoyingly run away and force you to constantly babysit them. This is much easier to deal with when you\u2019re playing with friends, as various ranged and swift builds can catch up with them or cut them off, but going at it solo it can be painstakingly slow. Luckily this sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen that often, but when it does, expect to groan audibly (until you return and start to crush bosses like normal enemies, then it feels incredible; battling them in the arena also eliminates the whole chasing step).What wows me the most is that it feels like\u00a0Monster Hunter\u00a0has finally entered the modern age. Now I don\u2019t mind the old visuals, nor do I require the cutting edge to play something, but the constant re-hashing of engines and iterations was really getting to me.\u00a0Capcom is the king of re-touching and re-selling the same \u201cultra\u201d or \u201csuper\u201d editions, and the\u00a0Monster Hunter\u00a0series saw plenty of \u201cUltimate\u201d and \u201cFreedom\u201d versions. We\u2019re probably going to get\u00a0Monster Hunter Universe\u00a0at some point, this is true, but right now it\u2019s still crisp and hot out of the oven.It hasn\u2019t shed its skin fully either. The sheer breadth of playstyles is staggering, from the quick dual blades, to the multiple bowgun ranged options, to the tough but rewarding hunting horn. It\u2019s a science at this point, but you can also opt to jump into a stabby or shooty combat style if you want. When you really dig though and start getting to the point where you need to optimize to best some of the bigger beasties, you\u2019ll probably be taken aback by some inside baseball type stuff, like the endless pit of bowgun ammo types. There\u2019s no new weapons in World, which is a bummer, but given how well all of the existing ones mesh together I don\u2019t necessarily need more.Crafting has become more convenient, not necessarily outright easier. There\u2019s a wishlist feature to notify you when you have the proper materials required to create something, and gathering locations are a little more obvious. That\u2019s no better typified than with the aforementioned firefly highlights, otherwise known as \u201cbread crumb trails\u201d in the industry at large, Monster Hunter World\u2018s most contentious mechanic.While some may feel like this \u201cdumbs down\u201d the flow of the game, I dig the idea of gaining research progression (non-traditional experience that can be spent on things like meals) when locating points of interest such as footprints or scents. It adds to the whole \u201chunt\u201d feel. It\u2019s also a little more inviting when you need to hunt down a certain enemy type over and over when you can track them directly.This is still Monster Hunter. You\u2019ll hunt, upgrade, hunt some more, and basically repeat until you\u2019re done with the campaign, then you can choose to do it some more with extra quests. Capcom is promising more content for the long haul, but as it stands World\u00a0feels just as full as any other core release.As for multiplayer, we didn\u2019t get much of a chance to extensively test it out \u2014 so we\u2019ll be mostly reporting on that post-launch. Right now lobbies seem to be stable and the chat/squad system is well-implemented (you can emote/message people even during cutscenes and connect with people through groups), which is a good sign. I had a limited pool of players to choose from, but I could join quests in progress and fire off SOS flares to signal other people that I needed help.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb7303ff-920c-4cfa-89d7-2f8145eec325": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb7303ff-920c-4cfa-89d7-2f8145eec325", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "95d47b27-de4d-4e57-b0a1-5d7031e8f875", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d13fc7c658e8852daf9e7544f10fb57e73a4f0da3d6bad004cdfa51f6549c64"}, "3": {"node_id": "9de5f5fb-99ed-4154-9aad-66eb2f8485c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7078ba1fa414aea098c4efa197381ec9551fdb0c99ec353859a6163855e2c808"}}, "hash": "b2fc637b4a953f10c0975fd3f6b0b0616c4bfb2a96bbe448d71430f589dd5e7f", "text": "This series is still fun as hell to team up in.If you\u2019ve been skipping out on\u00a0Monster Hunter games for a while because they seem to blend together, jumping into World\u00a0is your chance to get in.\u00a0Just know that Capcom hasn\u2019t really shaken up the formula enough to piss off veterans or appeal to people who don\u2019t welcome grinding with open arms.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

Login NowMonster Hunter: World is a brilliant game that often gets in its own way.Several hours into Monster Hunter: World, a buddy and I took on an Anjanath, one of the tougher monsters in the first region you can explore. We paid no attention to its structural and elemental weak points, nor its potential ailments. We didn\u2019t really plan our powders and potions. We simply joined up in the Ancient Forest and went after it, not bothering to fire a flare to bring in more assistance. Two or so hours and three resets later, we called it a night, thoroughly frustrated.With some games, that would have been enough to send me packing for good. You\u2019re looking at the guy who put $130 into For Honor and ended up playing less than 60 minutes. With Monster Hunter: World, though, I wanted to go back, I just didn\u2019t really know why.The next day, I loaded into Monster Hunter: World and brought up the notes the Chief Ecologist had on the Anjanath. I learned about all the things I didn\u2019t bother to study the night before. I took this knowledge to the smithy and forged the proper weapon, then went to the training yard and learned how to use it. I prepared potions and powders to keep me from fainting, then I went back to the Ancient Forest and helped a group of random players dispatch the Anjanath like it was nothing. That was the moment I realized you only get out of Monster Hunter: World what you put in, and I was hooked.Backing up to my first few hours in Monster Hunter: World, it wasn\u2019t just the Anjanath that had me on the brink of quitting, it was also the co-op mechanics. Trying to play Monster Hunter: World with friends is a lot like trying to eat soup with a fork. You can do it, but nothing about it is intuitive. Perhaps I\u2019ve been spoiled by the ease of playing co-op in games like Ghost Recon Wildlands and Destiny 2, but the system Monster Hunter: World uses is bad.For instance, you can only play an assigned story mission together if you and your friend have both progressed far enough. Seems fair, but Monster Hunter World will make you start almost every main story mission solo. You\u2019ll remain by yourself until you watch a cut scene, at which point either you or your friend will have to exit their session to join the other. However, if you are a solo player looking for help from random gamers, the SOS system works quite well, and you\u2019d probably feel that the multiplayer and co-op mechanics are solid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9de5f5fb-99ed-4154-9aad-66eb2f8485c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "9de5f5fb-99ed-4154-9aad-66eb2f8485c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb7303ff-920c-4cfa-89d7-2f8145eec325", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b2fc637b4a953f10c0975fd3f6b0b0616c4bfb2a96bbe448d71430f589dd5e7f"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ccb4d43-84cf-41fd-ac94-965040bd2478", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "40b41a74db6ccc84abc9696aa92d85cbc3498d902075e631d2f026edda0ab30e"}}, "hash": "7078ba1fa414aea098c4efa197381ec9551fdb0c99ec353859a6163855e2c808", "text": "Most of the trouble with co-op is directly related to trying to play with specific people.Monster Hunter: World is best experienced when you\u2019re lost in a cycle of exploring, resource gathering, and crafting. I probably say it too much, but open world games are at their peak when you want to spend time in the environments. I love visiting the Smithy and seeing what it will take to craft my desired armor, looking for a related quest, then heading out to gather the necessary supplies. It\u2019s a system that ensures all the locations and monsters will remain relevant even after you\u2019ve completed the main story.I didn\u2019t care much for the narrative in Monster Hunter: World. The premise was fine but playing it through was forgettable at best. Two encounters with a monster named Zorah Magdaros were so bad I was laughing. Even now, I\u2019m not sure what I did to progress. There were points in the first encounter where my objective was to drive away another monster. I never ended up finding that monster, but apparently it grew bored and took off on its own.The second battle was a tiny bit better, but stilled flawed from start to finish. I found more objectives, but the quest continued to move forward even when I hadn\u2019t completed them. It ended with about 10 minutes of me running back and forth, loading cannons and firing away while someone was screaming at me about how it wasn\u2019t good enough. I was just glad when it was over, although it wasn\u2019t really. There were still more assigned quests to complete and more regions to discover. More cut scenes to watch while you wait for Monster Hunter: World to get out of its own way.I have given Destiny 2 a verbal beatdown that borders on cruel, but Monster Hunter: World could take a few notes about how Bungie handles social spaces. With Destiny 2 I always feel connected. I can be a solo player in the Tower and it feels alive. In Monster Hunter: World, it\u2019s just you in Astera unless you head up to the Gathering Hub. I think I\u2019ve been there twice, and I have no idea why anyone would need to go back. It leaves me feeling somewhat alone when I\u2019m playing, even though I know thousands of others are in the same space. Monster Hunter: World puts the armor, loot, and resource systems of Destiny 2 to shame, but I can\u2019t help feeling like Astera is a missed opportunity as a social space.That lonely feeling continues when you head out on an expedition. Yes, you can fire that SOS and be joined by a few fellow players, but it feels forced. It\u2019s the difference between inviting someone into your home to visit and bumping into strangers while you\u2019re running errands. You may not talk to those strangers, but you take comfort from knowing they\u2019re out and existing in the same space as you. I\u2019m not saying Monster Hunter: World needs to be more like Destiny 2, but there\u2019s a disconnect with the co-op and multiplayer for me.What Monster Hunter: World gets right is your Palico companion. I created Chuck, my real cat with an attitude. Chuck is a genuine benefit when I\u2019m playing alone or even with one other person. He attacks the monsters I\u2019m battling, heals me, digs up extra resources, and manages to work \u201cmeow\u201d into everything he has to say. He has his own armor and gets a weapon, and I find myself caring just as much about his gear as I do my own. It really feels like Chuck, and I\u2019m equally as defensive about him in-game as I am in life. When a monster attacks him things get belligerent, although in truth he saves me far more often than I save him.The Palico system is one of the best in Monster Hunter: World. You can level your Palico up to make them more efficient, and they act as a gadget delivery system for perks you unlock. I can count on Chuck for a timely heal, or to toss down a Shock Trap when I need to pin a monster down and cause some damage. I can even connect with my friend\u2019s Palicos when they\u2019re offline, taking two companions with me, both of which put in work.The studying and planning in Monster Hunter: World is perfection. The actual combat, however, can be a bit wonky. Capcom has done a great job with the environments, making them as much a part of the fight as the weapons. I\u2019m a big fan of using verticality to my advantage, jumping on the backs of monsters and stabbing them in the face.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ccb4d43-84cf-41fd-ac94-965040bd2478": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ccb4d43-84cf-41fd-ac94-965040bd2478", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "12dd083c-f884-4a19-b7e5-aadec6383b17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a34ea0c885ce9644364599054ffc0057f4c67e6cd4b2f48f0223566a9c45b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9de5f5fb-99ed-4154-9aad-66eb2f8485c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7078ba1fa414aea098c4efa197381ec9551fdb0c99ec353859a6163855e2c808"}, "3": {"node_id": "d29309bc-cd32-4de7-b717-15909bccba3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9071a5270ab7724bacc36b50bdb9bc17c18e507630f45e18618b4901cf2a356e"}}, "hash": "40b41a74db6ccc84abc9696aa92d85cbc3498d902075e631d2f026edda0ab30e", "text": "The problem is there\u2019s just too much inconsistency. Mounting a monster feels like it\u2019s as much about luck as it is skill. That system, like the monster\u2019s hit boxes, feels sloppy.As far as striking a monster with your weapon, that feels tight. I can\u2019t recall thinking that I\u2019d landed a blow that didn\u2019t register. The problem comes from the monsters moving around with you in close proximity. Yes, I get that they are huge and you\u2019d get trampled, and that\u2019s fine, but what isn\u2019t fine is when you\u2019re consistently getting knocked down, or even fainting, and you\u2019re certain you got out of the way. Perhaps once or twice, but time and time again I was left feeling cheated, and that\u2019s a tough one to take when it sends your team back to Astera as the final faint.The monster AI is another example of what Capcom got right. These beasts go about their business in the world whether you\u2019re there or not. They move between zones and live their lives. Often you can pass by them and, so long as you don\u2019t go mean mugging them, they\u2019ll just continue on the path. Most monsters won\u2019t fuss with you if you don\u2019t give them reason, although there are exceptions.Even when the fight begins, the monster AI is on point. There are no health bars, so you must depend on visual cues and monster behavior to get a sense of how you\u2019re doing. Chop a tail off and the beast will howl. Hurt it enough and it will limp off towards its nest, desperate to recover. This often makes me feel like I\u2019m the real monster in each encounter. I\u2019ve attacked this creature in its habitat, often unprovoked, and when it is so hurt that it limps away to try and recover from near death, I hunt it down and finish the job. That\u2019s some nonsense right there, but I do love my fancy Zorah Magdaros armor.Peak monster hunting is done in groups of at least two. My buddy prefers to strike from range and I like to fight in a phone booth. Eye gouging, foot stomps, and Chuck\u2019s claws taking chunks of flesh. It\u2019s a messy style, and it\u2019s most effective when I have a co-op friend there to provide heals and ranged distractions. I can count on my pal to draw the monster near a cliff so I can try for a mount or lure the beast into a trap where it can be put to sleep. Things get a bit more hectic and unorganized with a group of four, especially if a couple are random players, but group fighting is almost always better than going it alone.I\u2019m on the fence with the visuals of Monster Hunter: World. The monsters look spectacular, and the environments feel very much alive. I played on PS4 and it\u2019s a good-looking game, but as a PC player, I mumbled to myself more than once about how I couldn\u2019t wait for it to come out on Steam this fall. Give me that glorious\u00a0Diablos fight in 2K with about 90 fps and I\u2019ll dance at your wedding. However, even as far as the PS4 is concerned, games like Horizon Zero Dawn and the Uncharted series look better. That\u2019s not a dig at Monster Hunter: World. Those are two stunning games and I don\u2019t feel like Monster Hunter: World is far behind.I\u2019m more than 70 hours deep into Monster Hunter: World. Although my copy was provided by Capcom, the price of admission for the average gamer is well worth it. My interest is waning, though. Maybe I\u2019m asking too much, but I really wanted a living, breathing game. Even though Monster Hunter: World does have events, it falls short of what it would take to keep me invested for the long haul, but that\u2019s okay. As a first-time player of the series, Monster Hunter: World has given me unique experiences and memories that, for better or worse, other games will be measured against for years to come. That has to be a win.This review is based on a PS4 download code provided by Capcom.
