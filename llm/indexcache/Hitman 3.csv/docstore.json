set of consoles to the next - hasn't really worked out. There's the sense that the next-gen versions aren't necessarily everything they could be, while the software served up to owners of the older consoles often verged on the unplayable. But as move from PS4 to PS5, from Xbox One to Xbox Series, it's clear that we're seeing something very different this time around. IO Interactive's Hitman 3 shows that cross-gen can actually work out just fine, and there's the feeling that prior generation consoles are being pushed closer to their ultimate limits, while simultaneously, massive gains are achieved when playing on PS5 and Xbox Series X.Of course, Hitman 3 is a game with additional interest for us, because IO's excellent Glacier Engine has evolved, bringing impressive new features into the technology - while at the same time back-porting those innovations to the entirety of the Hitman trilogy. It's to IO's credit that with each Hitman release, and with each iteration of Glacier, existing content has been ported to the latest game, benefitting from the engine upgrades. It's doubly useful for Hitman 3 played on a next-gen console because the baseline improvements are so profound, it's effectively both a new game and a next-gen remaster of the older releases. So how has Glacier moved on? The new maps are truly effective showcases for some of the new technology and the initial Dubai mission is a beautiful debut for a range of effects - foremost amongst them the arrival of a remarkable implementation of screen-space reflections. The environment is packed with reflective surfaces including metal and glass, presented in a brightly lit manner that would make imperfections obvious, while Hitman continues to look pristine. Of course, there are limits to SSR - off-screen detail can never be reflected - but Glacier has some interesting tricks up its sleeve for enhancing the effect. So, for example, the game's signature crowds are reflected too, but it seems that these are 2D-sprite like 'imposters' to save on processing resources, while still looking very effective.All of this is achieved by building upon the existing Glacier tech, so SSR is bolstered with pleasing cubemaps (static light probes with textured surfaces that can be used to mimic reflections) along with the render-to-texture feature that debuted in Hitman 2. Here, the scene is effectively rendered twice, the secondary viewpoint mapped to a texture to deliver a 'proper' reflection. It's heavy on resources, it needs to be applied sparingly and typically it only works on flat, mirror-like surfaces - but crucially, it looks good. In time we'd hope to see full ray tracing alternatives, but for now, it does the trick - and it works on all supported consoles.If we skip ahead to a later mission, we're treated to another visually striking scenario - a rainy Chinese city at night. This map showcases another new string to Glacier's bow through the simulation of rain and wet surfaces. Raindrops realistically play off 47's coat while a nice droplet effect is crafted to represent puddles. When you make your way to the stage's main street, the combination of reflections and neon signs delivers a dark atmosphere not unlike Hitman Contracts - the original third Hitman game. It's dark, beautiful and really showcases the engine in a new light.It's also interesting to see how the new additions to the Glacier Engine feed back into the legacy Hitman content. The classic Paris stage from the original Hitman still looks wonderful to this day, but the marble flooring effect now benefits from the new SSR pass - and the content manages to run better than the original game on Series X running under backwards compatibility. It also looks as though IO has revisited the way that trees and foliage are rendered. I'm not sure there's actually much in the way of improvement as such (at least on the older maps) but it's definitely a change there. Other differences are less profound, but show an eye for detail - a static curtain may now possess cloth physics animation, for example. Overall though, it's the retrofitting of screen-space reflections that shows the biggest change - that, and performance of course. On the vanilla last-gen machines, Hitman titles could be run capped to 30fps or unlocked, while Xbox One X also benefitted from 4K quality and 1440p performance modes. In the shift to Hitman 3, all last-gen machines are capped at 30fps and there are no quality and performance modes (bar one exception, which I'll address shortly). On the one hand, Hitman 3 possesses engine upgrades and ambitions in the content that justify the limitations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "424c4f7a-1773-479a-beae-65005d14fa54": {"__data__": {"id_": "424c4f7a-1773-479a-beae-65005d14fa54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "864eb2d6-d13d-4d9d-b52b-c87009dc928d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "095d24239ad94a775cb1c5fecd8f9583dc0ddca0128fbac7846dd58d9cc4ec61"}, "3": {"node_id": "f0bd2aeb-871d-429b-83a6-f843cb4d0dbc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "77bc8f89c711cfc1487920d5170afa94f5b90a9ece613f864c7d32eddd19805b"}}, "hash": "f0cc105c9eaf5109310fe2558e1fc5ada1d2f3d8afab7d8f499a2f8d495afb09", "text": "On the other, Xbox One X owners in particular may prefer to retain Hitman 2 for its ability to access legacy missions at frame-rates above 30fps. The outlier here is PS4 Pro, which curiously offers both 1440p30 and 1080p60 modes. We tried the latter on the initial Dubai stage and found that while it wasn't as smooth and consistent as Xbox Series S's 1080p60 output (though curiously, shadow quality is higher), it was close enough to 60fps to make it the preferable way to play on last-gen PS4 systems. PlayStation owners also get the chance to play every mission from the entire trilogy in VR too. The compromises are self-evident, but it works. It's just a shame that to access VR on PlayStation 5, you need to run the PS4 code, doubling up on installs. It's unfortunate but it's the way that Sony chooses to set up the system, and there's nothing IO could really do here. All of which leads us on to the actual next-gen difference - why we prefer to play Hitman 3 on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. First of all, the bump up to full 4K (or 1800p, in the case of PS5) definitely plays a role. In the past we've talked about how image reconstruction techniques and dynamic resolution scaling make the need to deliver 8.3m pixels per frame less of a necessity, and that's definitely the case - especially in the age of temporal anti-aliasing. However, the Glacier Engine concentrates on delivering a pristine presentation that does not rely so heavily on heavy post-processing or temporal accumulation techniques to achieve its goals. Hitman 3 focuses on clean lines and well-defined spaces, where a higher resolution definitely helps. This requires brute force horsepower and that's what the new consoles deliver. Then there's the 60 frames per second update rate, and the way that a nigh-on unwavering 60fps adds further to the pristine presentation. Beyond that, Hitman 3 focuses on refinement. Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 have access to more system memory that any of their last-gen counterparts, so the equivalent of PC's ultra level textures are deployed. This is supplemented with a move to 8x anisotropic filtering, which is a nice step up from the 4x seen on the last-gen versions of the game. Shadow quality is also improved, specifically on Xbox Series X, which stands alone from all the console versions in matching PC's high preset.And in summary, that's why Hitman 3 works as a cross-gen title. Unlike the messy transition periods we've seen in the past, there are still enhancements delivered for the last-gen consoles and while we've lost the unlocked frame-rate on most of the older systems, performance is still consistent overall. I am baffled as to why Xbox One X owners don't get access to an unlocked frame-rate mode (on paper, it should run even better than PS4 Pro) but ultimately I don't feel like last-gen users get shortchanged. Meanwhile, it's clear that next-gen consoles get a more refined, smoother and prettier experience - even if there is the sense that Hitman 3 isn't specifically targeting the capabilities of the new hardware. But when a game looks as good as this, runs as well as this and features some superb new missions, it's difficult to complain. And there is one more aspect I'd like to highlight - loading times. We talked about this a touch in our platform comparison piece, but we're looking at sub-ten second loading times for all missions. In one specific case, a circa ten second mission load on Series X can take around 59 seconds on One X - and in terms of overall quality of life, that's an extreme upgrade that's well worth having, especially when it comes to reloading after death.

I don't care much about that story, with its paint-by-numbers betrayals and toneless briefing sequences: its only virtue is to keep you moving around the globe, from one extravagant playground to another. But much to my surprise, I do care rather a lot about Agent 47, about the strange figure he cuts against the contents of his own world and the wider landscape of videogames.The big joke of 47, of course, is that you can't miss him.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0eb456b4-4284-49ce-8f77-ce386552a800": {"__data__": {"id_": "0eb456b4-4284-49ce-8f77-ce386552a800", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0bd2aeb-871d-429b-83a6-f843cb4d0dbc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "77bc8f89c711cfc1487920d5170afa94f5b90a9ece613f864c7d32eddd19805b"}, "3": {"node_id": "599280c7-45b4-4fd2-b6c1-acd2c9035bcd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e859d69a6541edb4fa8e13f4f13fd5f53070ad6afe5983be732eb46e017d9df"}}, "hash": "8215c58c22f02e09d6a812bd3d63162801b2880b32fcf629e46138b105f8e566", "text": "He stands out like, well, a menacing, chalk-white man with a barcode on his head. In the reboot trilogy, you can mingle with NPCs to throw off suspicious guards, and the impression is always of a fridge trying to blend into a flock of sheep - even the Terminator looks more natural in a crowd. Yet somehow, 47 is the ultimate shape-shifter, able to disguise himself as anyone from a celebrity DJ to a noodle chef. IO has wisely refrained from making this ability to fit in more plausible, even as it has pumped up the splendour of Hitman's locations, and the result is an assassination game that is secretly a comedy long before you start dressing up as a butler and whacking people with fish.The joke extends to the fact that Agent 47 is somewhat unconvincing as an avatar, or at least, an avatar in a game that occupies the same commercial plateau as Assassin's Creed. He's an old school anomaly carried forward from an era when ledge-mantling was an exotic practice. When he puts on a disguise, the clothes simply teleport from the victim's body to his own. When he stows a corpse, there's a slightly awkward little cutscene. I'm not convinced 47 even obeys the same laws of physics as anybody else in the game. When he's shot, it makes no impression beyond a bit of controller rumble.All which might sound like I'm having a go at the animation team. Not at all - Agent 47's blunt economy of gesture and reaction are painstakingly crafted, and there's something endearing about this early-noughties stiffness, this lack of flourish in an age when AC protagonists slink through the geometry trailing a boutique's worth of cloth and harness. Questions of development budget aside, Agent 47 doesn't need \"seamless\" transitions or grounding naturalistic touches any more than he needs a sniper drone or a holographic decoy. What he needs, mostly, is the ability to stand still and an eye for details like poorly secured chandeliers. Playing as 47 fosters a sense of eerily laidback contemplation that remains unique among stealth sims and as such, makes the absence of new features in Hitman 3 easier to swallow (though not, perhaps, the loss of features like the last game's entertaining Ghosts competitive mode). This is a sturdy third act that creeps along firmly in the footsteps of its predecessors. Whether you're trying for a main story target, or tackling one of the tougher Escalation hits with additional restrictions, the basic rhythms of the game are the same: choose a starting location and a couple of tools, then try to find your way from public areas through layers of security to your quarry's vicinity, scooping up other tools enroute, and looking out for things you can sabotage. The less noticeable you are, and the more poetic and/or bizarre your methods, the higher your score. Costumes found or taken from NPCs make you undetectable to many onlookers providing you're where you're expected to be and not doing anything odd, like slipping rat poison into somebody's cocktail or meddling with a giant mechanical sun. Agent 47's invisibility is a flexible social metaphor, revealing the presumptions of those nearby. When he poses as an executive on a factory tour, his invisibility is the armour of privilege. When he dresses as a waiter at a sky-high soiree, it's the invisibility of little people in the presence of their betters. Maps follow a complex running order, with targets moving from spot to spot: the key is working out where they'll be when, or uncovering ways of changing the pattern. The estate owner is well-defended, but perhaps if you cause havoc in the winery downstairs you can lure him into the open. The wandering programmer has a bodyguard, but perhaps you can find a way of tying the latter up while his client gets herself into hot water. Hitman 3 is most rewarding when you disable the handholds and parts of the HUD, attempting to make it through via in-world observation alone, but you'll likely follow proximity-activated Intel prompts and waypoints during your first try. These give you more of a narrative flavour and gently walk you through some fancier ways of nobbling your targets. After three WOA instalments, IO has refined the art of using story missions to introduce the areas and tantalise you with their possibilities. The meat of the game still lies in replaying with different targets and more challenging criteria, but it feels like the studio is having a bit more fun with these opening guided forays.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "599280c7-45b4-4fd2-b6c1-acd2c9035bcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "599280c7-45b4-4fd2-b6c1-acd2c9035bcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "0eb456b4-4284-49ce-8f77-ce386552a800", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8215c58c22f02e09d6a812bd3d63162801b2880b32fcf629e46138b105f8e566"}, "3": {"node_id": "56a32dd3-a05e-4593-a272-59e16258ba33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a9dfda0b917a2c8c480a6255db612e91b03109719b72da5c46063dbdc164015"}}, "hash": "6e859d69a6541edb4fa8e13f4f13fd5f53070ad6afe5983be732eb46e017d9df", "text": "The game's Dartmoor map, for instance, gives you the option of posing as a detective investigating a suspicious suicide, which effectively allows you to stop playing Hitman and experience the whole thing as an Agatha Christie-style whodunnit - asking for alibis, cross-referencing testimonies and tracking down clues, all of it elegantly folded into the existing intel menu system. The map itself is a nice balance of big and intimate, with a core cast of blue-bloods and hard-pressed servants, wandering the endless carpets of a gloomy mansion. Play it without disguising yourself as the detective - which, unlike most outfits, makes you completely undetectable - and it's much more challenging: guards everywhere, no public access as such, and lots of cavernous hallways with little to hide behind.The six new maps - all set in and around the sanctums of the wealthy - are on par quality-wise with those of Hitman and Hitman 2. The two standouts are probably Berlin and Argentina. The former sees you trying to expose and bump off enemy agents in a huge club built inside a decommissioned power station. There are plenty of backstage areas, elevations and \"unfortunate accidents\" to choose from, and the ambience is intoxicating - you get a main dancefloor with pyrotechnics-heavy DJ set, scattered chillout cafes and invitation-only drug dens. Argentina, meanwhile, is a sprawling and well-attended retirement party at a sunny estate with its own vineyard and a high-tech winery. It's a sumptuous layer cake: take the main road in and you'll reach a plaza where socialites dance and swap stories about the host. Further in and above, you'll find plush roof gardens and a fortified villa. It's a great fun for snipers, once you've reached the summit, but you'll find you can be just as effective with a pair of shears.The Dubai skyscraper map has some cool assassination possibilities involving skydiving, and is a stunning assemblage of gold and glass floating against a murky cloudscape. I was less taken by the China map - it's redolent of Sapienza in the first game, with a town environment concealing a huge underground data centre, but there's a little too much emphasis here on sneaking through conveniently man-sized air vents. Hitman is simply more interesting as a social stealth game than when you're lurking in crawlspaces.Carpathian Mountains is also a slight disappointment as a final map - it starts you off at the back of a speeding laboratory train and asks you to make your way to the front. The result is undeniably atmospheric but it's obviously rather linear - you're climbing onto the roof or around the outside of cars to get behind guards, and the environmental setups are more pedestrian, almost like optional tactical takedowns in a corridor shooter. That said, I have yet to replay it with different starting locations and targets - I suspect the level is more complex if you begin further up and travel backwards. The linearity is, of course, a thrown gauntlet: how creative can you be in a very confined space? All the maps are worth revisiting as much for certain deft human moments as the satisfaction of a kill. On Dartmoor, for instance, there's a security guard and a maid who keep trying to chat each other up, breaking off in embarrassment when you appear. You now have a camera which, aside from allowing you to wirelessly hack doorlocks, lets you preserve these moments, some of which are tethered to Challenges. As before, finishing a hit earns you XP towards your map mastery, unlocking new starting locations and tools. If you want to up the ante still further there's the returning Contracts mode, in which you tailor-make a hit for other players by first carrying it out yourself.\r\nSadly I wasn't able to try out one of Hitman 3's most promising features during my playthrough - the PlayStation VR support, which lets you wander the maps in first-person using a PS4 controller. The feature has now been added to the review build and will be a day-one update for the retail version. It only applies to the PS4 version, but this also runs on PS5 and is included free with the purchase. Eurogamer's VR connoisseur Ian Higton is even now digging his face into the functionality, and you can expect an article on the subject very soon.\r\nThe great provocative unfulfilled possibility of the World of Assassination trilogy is that maps don't really respond once you've killed somebody. Guard patrol patterns tighten up, bodies are bagged and removed, and certain bigwigs might flee to saferooms, but the mood and fundamental workings of the space carry on unaltered.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56a32dd3-a05e-4593-a272-59e16258ba33": {"__data__": {"id_": "56a32dd3-a05e-4593-a272-59e16258ba33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "599280c7-45b4-4fd2-b6c1-acd2c9035bcd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e859d69a6541edb4fa8e13f4f13fd5f53070ad6afe5983be732eb46e017d9df"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5772cdd-ace6-47fe-9e58-9e616885b960", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b80fd1ab3ad47c5084cff0102ad05b921eb16ac24a72bc26ba49dc441ac54e23"}}, "hash": "7a9dfda0b917a2c8c480a6255db612e91b03109719b72da5c46063dbdc164015", "text": "I finished off my first Argentina playthrough by shooting a woman with a sniper rifle in full view of a hundred people - when I drifted through the area as a waiter a moment later it was like it had never happened. The nearest you get in Hitman 3 to a kind of map-wide \"second act\" is in China, where one of the more elaborate killing methods results in a full lockdown that drives half the workforce outside to stand gossiping in the rain.There are more down-to-earth reasons for this inflexibility - it's hard to implement that kind of change on maps this large, carefully organised and animate without breaking things and adding years to development time. But it also speaks to the plot's rather forlorn theme of a world in which you can punish individuals but never bring down the systems that facilitate their wickedness. \"There will always be people like them, so there must also be people like us,\" is one of Hitman 3's concluding lines. It's meant to sound like a victory. (It certainly leaves room for another sequel.)All the same, there is something very hopeful about Hitman, an optimism that somehow coexists with its air of absurdity. If these worlds are depraved and ridiculous, full of evil people wallowing in their own crapulence, they are always wobbling around the rim of their own undoing. Behind Agent 47's myriad disguises I sense a faith in the self-defeating logic of the universe, a conviction that if he is patient and watchful, if he only allows himself to move with the flow, the planets will align, the walls will disappear, and for a second or so, the heart of the machine will be exposed for all to see.

This is a spiritual and mechanical continuation of the previous two games, but IO still has a few surprises up its sleeve. And one level in particular might just be the studio's masterpiece.I'm in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Berlin. Spindly lasers and spotlights sweep across a shadowy dancefloor, revealing a sea of bobbing heads hypnotised by throbbing techno music. The music is so loud, and the bass so deep, it makes my headphones vibrate. But I'm not here because Agent 47 has given up contract killing and joined the German rave scene, even though that would be a pretty funny way to end the story. I'm here to murder a team of deadly assassins who are also trying to murder me.Ten hitmen are patrolling the warehouse and a scrubby industrial wasteland surrounding it. And here's the kicker: they know what I look like, even if I'm wearing a disguise. I can still change clothes to stroll past lowly security guards, but these trained killers aren't so easily fooled. If they catch sight of me they'll open fire, which means I have to rely on those swarms of pill-popping ravers, and the maze-like architecture of the building, to conceal myself.Most Hitman targets are cowards hidden away in a fortress behind a wall of armed guards, which makes these guys so thrilling to go up against. It's a totally different dynamic, and one of the challenging missions in the trilogy as a result. There aren't even any Mission Stories in this level, the in-game hint system that usually suggests entertaining ways to kill your targets. This encourages you to experiment with the sandbox and dream up your own methods.Now all I have to do is figure out how to kill them without anyone noticing, in front of thousands of witnesses, in the middle of a raveTo complicate matters, the assassins are also disguised.

When I catch one talking to their handler in instinct mode\u2014which highlights targets, points of interest, weapons, and so on\u2014their cover is blown and they're marked permanently on the map. Now all I have to do is figure out how to kill them without anyone noticing, in front of thousands of witnesses, in the middle of a rave. I could just shoot them and run away, of course, but that's no way to play Hitman.It seems impossible at first. Some of the targets follow routines where they're constantly surrounded by people. One of them, the leader, even has a bodyguard who never leaves his side. But the beauty of Hitman is carefully studying these big, intricate levels, making a mental map, and finding holes in the security to exploit. When you do finally manage to kill five of these assassins\u2014enough to send the others fleeing\u2014it feels incredible.Although Hitman 3 builds on the solid foundations laid by the first two parts of the trilogy, sharing the same AI, stealth systems, and user interface, IO has also taken this opportunity to experiment a little with its tried and tested formula. The complex, open-ended Berlin level is the most the studio has ever trusted a Hitman player to take the lead and figure things out for themselves. And in the other levels there are, surprisingly, only three Mission Stories per map, compared to an average of about ten in the previous two games' levels.The opportunities are still there: elaborate traps to set up, people to pose as, shortcuts to take, keys to swipe. They just aren't as clearly signposted this time around, forcing you to engage more with the environment around you. At its core this is still very much a classic Hitman game, but in many ways a more playful, experimental one. One level set in a dusty old mansion in Dartmoor, England sees Agent 47 posing as a private detective and solving a murder mystery straight out of an Agatha Christie novel. It's a gimmick, but a fun, unique spin on what is otherwise a fairly typical assassination mission.The mansion itself is brilliantly constructed. Long, dark corridors lined with oil paintings open up into bright, lavishly decorated drawing rooms. And behind the walls there's a labyrinth of secret passages to discover with peepholes for spying on people. There's also a wonderful feeling of isolation, with the house standing alone in an expanse of barren, overcast moorland that stretches infinitely into the distance. No one makes places quite like IO Interactive, and in Hitman 3 you'll find some of the developer's finest creations to date.Chongqing is another standout. It's a pretty straightforward mission compared to Berlin and Dartmoor, but an incredible piece of level design. Above, rain-soaked streets buzzing with fluorescent neon signs, noodle bars, apartment blocks, and winding, trash-stuffed alleyways. Below, a gleaming futuristic facility with multiple layers of security, heavily armed guards, and vent systems to slip through. This impossibly intricate double-stacked level is one of the most impressive things IO has ever created; both in terms of atmosphere and aesthetic, and in how many interesting ways there are to navigate it.As for the other levels, Hitman 3 opens with Agent 47 taking a trip to Dubai and infiltrating a glamorous soir\u00e9e at the top of its tallest building. He enters the level by parachute, crawls through a window, slips into a tuxedo, and blends into the crowd\u2014as if we needed any more proof that IO loves James Bond. It's a real visual treat too, with immense gilded palm trees, reflecting pools, and dramatic views over the cloud-covered city. But for all its glamour it's a rather simple, reserved level, feeling more like a tutorial to ease new players in.This impossibly intricate double-stacked level is one of the most impressive things IO has ever createdDubai introduces the digital camera, a largely forgettable new gadget that 47 always has in his inventory, regardless of what you selected at the mission planning phase. With it you can scan things for extra intel or hack electronic panels to trigger certain things\u2014for instance, activating a futuristic window's frosted glass to cover you, or remotely opening a vent cover. It's a frivolous addition, really, and feels slightly out of place in a Hitman game. But the levels are almost never designed around it, so thankfully it's not too intrusive. And in its favour, I do like how you can use the zoom function to scout ahead.Later, 47 travels to Mendoza, Argentina and sneaks into yet another high-class party: this time at a winery.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48009889-0d6c-4a5f-818a-fcf557b36a52": {"__data__": {"id_": "48009889-0d6c-4a5f-818a-fcf557b36a52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "61d11471-80e9-44fd-91e2-86eaa3aa9132", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "adecd6170d74090cfc2e830ca1a21870eeeeaac0800c75bad2c819e0c5935374"}, "3": {"node_id": "c693da53-3e77-4662-a8de-9513be247c84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "96327b7b54279ff273b00f84bbe1bcd70b4df09aee851167bc058ed954da78d6"}}, "hash": "740e50bce1d1c4609d176899f32b5c2ade523893f3e7a34fbcabfc8ac7e5cf19", "text": "With golden early evening sun falling over the vineyards, it's gorgeous to look at, and a Mission Story involving a sniper is especially devilish. The level is split between the winery, where the party is being held, a scattering of rocky foothills patrolled by gaucho guards, and a colonial villa where one of your targets lives. It's another level that plays things relatively safe, but it's much more detailed and involved than Dubai.The sixth and final map, set among Romania's rugged Carpathian Mountains, isn't a typical Hitman level at all. It's more like an action set-piece, designed to finish Agent 47's story in spectacular fashion. It's a tightly choreographed, visually impressive finale, but it is, essentially, scripted. Without spoiling anything, the nature of the level means there's no room for exploration. You do get a few opportunities to flex your creativity, but mostly you're just doing what you're told. This makes it the weakest by default, even though it's crafted with the same level of care and polish that defines all of IO's levels.Over the years, IO has gotten really good at designing the many small stealth challenges that litter its levels. The placement of guards, improvised weapons, blind corners, security cameras, and places to hide bodies is often pitch perfect. There are countless tiny, satisfying moments in these levels where you're given just enough to cleverly outfox the AI and use the environment to your advantage. You rarely feel backed into a corner, or in a situation you can't find a way out of, which speaks to the quality of the game's design. And as you unlock additional tools and gadgets, the sandbox only gets deeper and more varied.Despite a couple of weaker levels, Hitman 3 is a sensational stealth game. Berlin, Chongqing, and Dartmoor represent the series at its best, which is a fine way to end the trilogy. And if you own the first two games you can\u2014once Epic figures out how\u2014access all of those levels here, with improved visuals and the ability to use the new game's gadgets and weapons in them. Do that, and this is easily one of the best games on PC. If this was a review of the trilogy as a whole, I'd stick a couple more points on the review score.

Knowing there's the tiniest crack to slip through, or a moment to exploit that can leave a target oh so tragically killed is never dulled by the repetition of running and rerunning the scenario like a time traveler that can only leave the loop after meeting the right conditions.\u00a0Release date: January 20, 2021\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch\nDeveloper: IO Interactive\nPublisher: IO InteractiveWhat those conditions are depend on your choices as Agent 47. There's obviously an 'ideal' end to each of the six levels, defined by the story, but options unfold as you explore. It's easy to finish a path and get away cleanly, while discovering some new and more interesting way to kill a target along the way that means you have to go back and try again. I really like the tragic accidents - like a tragic fall after someone loosened a balcony handrail. Or tragic electrocution by your own art installation. Then there was someone being tragically crushed by a giant wine press. And those tragically sabotaged parachutes... What should be repetitive never is, as the reward of new opportunities constantly freshens up revisits. \u00a0It's also, for all the death, playful. There's comedy to burying someone in their own grave at a sham funeral they organised to try and hide from public view. At one point I was able to kill someone by sequentially firing key employees to chain a sequence of events together that led to a fatal workplace health and safety violation. I'm currently replaying a level because there's an option to get a target's wife to kill them that I haven't found yet and I really want to set that off.\u00a0All these options mean each location is a beautiful standalone moment of worldbuilding - from the gameplay relevant lines that tease and draw you in the directions of murderous opportunities, to throwaway dialogue that flesh out incidental characters and environmental details. It's easy to get distracted following threads just because it's interesting to find out more about some cleaner's petty grudge or a guard's troublesome relationship issues.\u00a0It's a story made of stories, then, but after two games of set up the main plot has a momentum behind it that makes for a coherent thriller from start to finish. You could wander through Hitman 1 and 2 loosely following the background plot of shadowy organisations and only really show up for the assassinations. You can do that here again here, obviously, but all the previous set up lands well, and there's a much more edge of the seat feel to playing the larger story as loose ends tie up and things start to get personal. Where previous games basically jumped between global locations with some arbitrary villain on-site to justify the visit, this has much more rhyme to its reason and has a stronger narrative flow to locations and story beats. There was at least one gasp from me near the start, and several 'oh I don't like where this is going at all' teeth clenches towards the end. The conclusion is particularly satisfying, and cements a far more movie feel to the events.Don't worry too much if you haven't been paying much attention though, each level still works fine on its own. The game encourages you to play certain paths the first time you reach an area to better tell the story but it's optional - you can still treat each location as a completely self-contained world to exploit, with little regard to the overall plot, if you just want to drown random bad people in their own toilet.Whatever your level of investment in the story, there's just really cool stuff to see and do. One of my favorite levels, set in a Berlin nightclub, is amazing not because of what you can do, but rather because of how it makes you feel. For reasons, Agent 47 is being hunted by multiple hidden enemies in Germany (I counted six but I can't be sure that's all), and you have to find and take out five to escape. In a packed European club. Filled with hundreds of oblivious party goers. My 'oh my God this is amazing' moment came when I located someone while on the dance floor - slipping through a huge crowd with music pounding and lights flashing, the camera panned hard left to watch the target tracking barely inches away, completely unaware of me in the throng of heaving bodies. It's an absolute rush to play that level in full secret agent mode, eliminating multiple adversaries, one at a time, without a warehouse full of party goers realizing. \u00a0\u00a0All the levels continue the series' abilities to create impressive locations for different reasons.

Dartmoor channels a full Knives Out-style murder mystery for you to solve; Chongqing is a stunningly labyrinthian maze of dense neon streets to uncover. The wine villa of Mendoza is a classic callback to old school Hitman, and the final level I'll leave you to discover because it's got a great 'holy shit what?' moment. All are beautifully realised and packed with detail to make sure that every possibility feels like a 'main' choice.\u00a0This is, bar a few changes I'll get to later, mechanically identical to the last two games and that's not a criticism. The systems of stealth, and costume changes used to infiltrate levels has worked beautifully for years, and it feels like this instalment cashes in what the previous games have learned. Level layout and design, tool and gear placement, effortlessly pulls you through the action feeling like the greatest (pretend) assassin in the world. A basic playthrough is entertaining and exhilarating in equal amounts, with just enough risk and reward to keep an edge to subsequent replays. Plus, as you play, you unlock new gear, places to smuggle equipment into, and escalating challenges to really test your omnipotent knowledge of the timeline.Where Hitman 3 makes any changes to its formula, it's in a way that adds to the experience \u00a0without shaking things too hard. There are new shortcuts that can be permanently created in levels to allow quicker access on subsequent playthroughs. In the Berlin nightclub, for example, there's a fire escape you can open from inside that lets you skip the security check at the door forever. Tricky to reach areas might have a ladder to drop so you can reach the same spot again without multiple costume changes and 10 minutes hiding in a cupboard. When half the fun comes from rerunning scenarios to try out different options it's an unobtrusive addition that acknowledges you put the work in to reach the shortcut in the first place.\u00a0Another new idea is a camera that works well when it feels relevant, but is underused. While it lets you take actual pictures in a limited photo mode, it's main use is to scan items and hack electronic locks. It only really comes into prominent use for a couple of levels and never entirely feels entirely implemented to its full potential.\u00a0The one big game changer addition is a PS VR mode that, at time of writing, I've not had a chance to play as it arrives in a launch day patch. It's a shame I couldn't test it because it's definitely an interesting idea I'm excited to try. But even if the option was an unplayable mess there's still more than enough here to recommend Hitman 3 without it. This is a great end to the trilogy, with a satisfying conclusion made from enjoyable and endlessly entertaining levels.

It was a quiet revelation that brought a spy-tinged, world-hopping simplification to the franchise. It presented players with detailed environments that provided endless opportunities to kill targets. Canvases with which to paint your bloody masterpieces of death.Crucially, it was all so ridiculous too. The games play their over-arching story straight, with Agent 47 trying to take down an Illuminati type organisation called Providence in cut scenes between missions. However, what has made modern Hitman games great is that they find humour in unexpected places. Throwing an explosive rubber duck at a crime lord, while dressed as a mime, is just another day on the job in Hitman. Even just the ringing \u2018dong\u2019 heard when throwing a fire extinguisher at a character\u2019s head, these games are incredible vehicles for slapstick comedy. Tom and Jerry cartoons played out in real-life.That remains true in Hitman 3. In every way, be it a pro or a con, the trilogy topper is very much a continuation of the previous games. That makes sense too. Hitman and Hitman 2 are integrated into Hitman 3, so if you own the previous two games you can load up missions right into Hitman 3 as if it was one of the game\u2019s own. This creates a lovely, tidy package for the trilogy and highlights the game\u2019s unwavering dedication to the form it pioneered in 2016.In terms of its systems, everything will be very familiar to fans; there is little new here to contend with that wasn\u2019t in the previous games. You knock people out by mashing the subdue button, you can gain access to areas by picking up errant keycards or wearing the correct attire. People who might blow your cover have a white dot above their head and you can use your instinct to see through walls and locate your targets. The other games being accessible through Hitman 3 makes sense because, in many ways, they\u2019re built as the same game.In Hitman 3, as is true in the previous two games, the true stars of the show are the open locations that act as levels. These are environments you will become intimate with as you learn their workings. The game\u2019s campaign only houses a handful of missions, large areas that can take anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes to beat the first time through. For a full campaign, that might seem short, and it is, but the joy of Hitman is going back into these levels and exploring all they have to offer.Hidden in many corners of these immaculately realised locations are opportunities and stories. Every location, be it the world\u2019s tallest building in Dubai or a family manor in Dartmoor, is teeming with storytelling. As you return, you\u2019ll come to appreciate and understand the connected nature of the area and the people that inhabit it. These are intricate machines, working beautifully in-sync. You are the wrench trying to dismantle them before anyone notices.The best storytelling comes from learning about the lives of these inhabitants. Often these narratives are small, such as the politics of housemaids and the petty gossip they share between one another. Other times they are useful. You might overhear how your target has a safe in his basement and that the code could be he and his wife\u2019s anniversary. This then leads you to do your own private investigating into what that might be, and end up having to google how long a crystal anniversary is.To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbrowser that\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsupports HTML5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvideoOther times, the stories are much bigger. In one notable sequence, you can take on the role of a private investigator hired to get to the bottom of a potential murder. What follows is a bizarre Knives Out-esque story that has you establish motives and alibis for the family members, all before drawing your own conclusion. Then, of course, murdering the person who hired you, because\u2026 well, this is Hitman. It\u2019s slightly awkward in execution but IO Interactive is having fun with what their system allows. The inventiveness it continually finds is endlessly charming.This all feeds into the inherent repeatability of these levels. You can, of course, run into a mission, take out your gun and shoot a target in the head and flee within a couple of minutes. However, the game is a beautiful reminder of the value of showmanship.

Or, you can meticulously set up a Heath Robinson machine of death that executes at the perfect moment. The latter always wins out, and players who dabble in the theatrics are going to have a more engrossing time.While these contained in-level narratives are a joy, the over-arching narrative on the other hand is a mess. Hitman\u2019s story has always been somewhat secondary to the act of murdering people. Even with that being the case, this entry feels particularly confused.Even as someone interested in the story around Providence over the last two games, this conclusion fails to land. There are big character moments with twists and turns, but it\u2019s told through just a few cut scenes between missions. That doesn\u2019t allow the story to breathe. Things often just happen with no time for reflection or what any of this means for these characters. It has the plot points of a complex spy novel, but one that is scribbled hastily on the back of a napkin.It\u2019s a confusing dichotomy as the game is so inherently good at telling the detailed stories of these locations, yet it so awkwardly fumbles with the narrative it has been trying to tell over three games. While that has always been the case in this trilogy, it\u2019s felt more so than ever as Hitman 3 tries to wrap up its story.Overall, Hitman 3 is a very welcome addition to the franchise. However, it comes with a big caveat. What once was a brilliant and detailed reimagining has started to wane with age. What\u2019s included here is a very good version of that form, but it has lost that exciting magic that made 2016 so revolutionary for the franchise. That doesn\u2019t come from inherent fault or mishandling from IO Interactive, but rather from familiarity.Instead of a full sequel, it feels more like an expansion. A beefy content drop built within the same game engine. The innovation comes in the wonderful maps, providing you with a stage to realise your deadly machinations. It doesn\u2019t come from any significant overhaul of what already exists.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationWhile a bittersweet sentiment, this feels like the perfect time for the franchise, in this form, to sign off. Getting out before it becomes tired. The trilogy is excellent and being able to house all three games in this tidy package is a great way to experience it. Agent 47 has had an excellent run over the last five years.This system and the freedom it gives players allows for so many emergent goofs and gaffes and Hitman 3 provides more of that in spades, even if it has started to show slight signs of stagnation. However, considering where the series was before this trilogy, IO Interactive can consider this mission accomplished.In Short: A great finale to the World of Assassination trilogy and the perfect time to end the reboot era, as the once revolutionary formula begins to show its age.Pros: Houses some of the best locations of the trilogy, with Dubai and Dartmoor being all-time greats. The missions have deep interconnected stories you can get lost in for hours. Housing all three games under one roof makes a tidy package.Cons: It feels like an expansion rather than a true sequel. The game looks and plays the same, and the overarching story is utterly bungled.

Over these three games, IO Interactive boldly set out to create a seamless Hitman experience that felt consistent, from the tutorial mission to the conclusion. After playing through this stunning finale, I\u2019m relieved that the studio stuck the landing. Every mission in the final arc is a statement, demonstrating a mastery of level design and a darkly playful willingness to subvert expectations laid out five years ago. Hitman 3 is not a good place to begin your Hitman journey, but it\u2019s a satisfying way to say goodbye.Hitman has always been about dropping players in unfamiliar locations, giving them a target, and then letting them run wild. The most recent games have taken that design philosophy to new heights. At its best, Hitman offers an experience like no other, delivering intricately crafted scenarios and giving players the tools they need to tackle missions in different ways. The first time I explored Hitman 3\u2019s bombastic opening mission in Dubai, I methodically explored as much of the Sceptre skyscraper as I could before killing my targets. Hours later, I was able to efficiently roll through without dawdling, killing both without anyone even knowing I was ever there. It\u2019s like visiting a supermarket; sometimes you want to comparison shop, and other times you just want to grab some milk and get out of the store.\u00a0Hitman 3 introduces new elements, including a camera gadget, but the most notable are its persistent shortcuts. By unlocking specific doors or accessing ladders, those newly available paths are open to you on subsequent runs. They\u2019re a great compliment to the series\u2019 unlockable starting locations, ultimately giving you the ability to bypass sections of a level and make a beeline for whatever \u2013 or whoever \u2013 you\u2019re most interested in pursuing. I loved meeting a partygoer outside of Berlin\u2019s nightclub area and getting a guided tour of the map, but was relieved when I found a side door that let me slip right past him and security. Some shortcuts are in riskier locations, so you have to weigh that additional danger, but I enjoyed having access to more options.IO Interactive has been crafting these types of missions for years now, and that experience shows. Nearly every mission introduces something that upends what longtime players have come to expect. The end goal of killing your targets is always part of the deal, but Hitman 3 proves that there\u2019s still plenty of room for more variety. One mission offers a lengthy (and optional) murder mystery to solve, putting you in the unusual role of private investigator and interrogator. In another, you begin without having any knowledge of your targets\u2019 identities. Working without intel, you have to methodically observe and listen to conversations before springing into action. If you\u2019re impatient, you can simply go on a rampage and hope for the best. Five of the six levels offer up a wealth of improvisational opportunities; I spent nearly two hours infiltrating a high-tech firm in China, and was captivated by just about every moment. The final mission is more linear than the others, but it\u2019s no less satisfying.Hitman 3 is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy, but if you haven\u2019t been impressed with previous entries it\u2019s not likely to change your mind. Its improvements, welcome as they may be for longtime fans, are incremental upgrades rather than the larger leaps that you might be accustomed to seeing in more traditional sequels. I enjoy its slow-burn pacing and love the tension that comes from slipping past guards unnoticed. I love looking at each level as its own weird puzzle, and something about poking the simulation to see what is and isn\u2019t possible really clicks with me. However, if you think the previous two installments have mediocre gunplay or find them too fussy, those elements haven\u2019t changed. You can technically jump into Hitman 3 without playing the previous games, but that is doing yourself a disservice. Much of the game\u2019s emotional and narrative weight hinges on you having experienced the trilogy.Hitman 3 concludes a chapter in the greater Hitman story, but it doesn\u2019t feel like an ending. There\u2019s an \u00a0abundance of content and side activities on offer, and the trilogy as a whole is bound to be a long-term destination for would-be assassins. IO Interactive\u2019s final act in the trilogy anticipates and rewards player experimentation, features meticulous level design, and has moments of ghoulish catharsis that makes me cackle aloud. My enthusiasm for it all is as indelible as the barcode tattooed on the back of Agent 47\u2019s head.This review is based solely on the PC version of Hitman 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98ddb5f0-2fae-4c5f-ad07-3b05a49d7f4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "98ddb5f0-2fae-4c5f-ad07-3b05a49d7f4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1750be4-89d9-4003-b465-01148799f690", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8108a6e6f7e2ff186aee57a4c0b68a0189c6f45e25c70d3db0248b7a4f3cec3"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e0ca942-d2b8-4406-be8b-fc3feddeb12c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a53712ca591748cdfba6ef38f2e84269c75898c944116ecc979fc14b624c56f"}}, "hash": "804757b428d07e8ca5cf3f1c33f8c970208deb24934417dc0e4188b5eb6fcd5b", "text": "At the time of this writing, the review code for the PlayStation version of the game was unavailable, so we\u2019re unable to evaluate its performance (or its VR capabilities) on consoles.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

As the blank slate Agent 47, you drop into clockwork missions in far-flung locales, exploiting targets\u2019 routines and generally wreaking havoc as creatively as you can. On one run, you poison a target, follow them to the bathroom, and drown them in the toilet mid-puke. On the next, having unlocked a new infiltration point and a corresponding disguise, you swap out a golf ball for its explosive twin, watching with glee from the garden as your target then plows a 9-iron into his unexpected demise.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.For more than 22 years, developer IO Interactive has honed its talent for extracting joy from repetition. With its newly released mode, one that fully earns the roguelike moniker, it has almost achieved perfection.As free DLC goes, Freelancer mode is less \u201cadditional content\u201d and more \u201csweeping reimagining.\u201d Whereas the base trilogy encourages replaying the same mission over and over \u2014 the better to execute more ingenious and hilarious kills \u2014 Freelancer prohibits repeats. You plan a mission with what limited intel you have, improvise in the field, and move on to the next location. This new gameplay loop revolves around taking down four syndicates across increasingly lengthy series of missions. The first syndicate requires completing two missions before luring out its leader. At that point, you drop into the final location, identify the leader by patiently watching for \u201ctells,\u201d and eliminate them. To complete a run, or \u201ccampaign,\u201d you need to kill all four syndicate leaders without dying. In total, you\u2019re looking at 18 locations. (If it sounds complicated, don\u2019t worry: IO made a pre-brief tutorial video, which you can watch here.)Of course, this being a roguelike, you\u2019re probably going to die \u2014 a lot. When you perish, you start a new campaign from the beginning, shuffling the targets, locations, and items, along with a multitude of modifiers and random events. You even lose any lock picks, sedatives, or explosives you had collected in your previous run. The only constant? Your safehouse.\n    Related\n  As the obsession with video game \u201chub worlds\u201d only continues to grow, IO has crafted a fortress of solitude to rival the best of them. Agent 47\u2019s bunker-beneath-a-house is sleek, utilitarian, and, for the world\u2019s foremost assassin, surprisingly cozy. I\u2019m reminded of the house in Ex Machina. By rising through the mastery ranks of Freelancer mode, you can unlock new rooms, earn more decorations, and fill in the gaps on those weapon walls that every spy worth their salt seems to have. The safehouse, unlike your tools, missions, or targets, does not reset between runs, and improving it is nearly as satisfying as fleshing out Zagreus\u2019 house in Hades. But while that corner of the underworld is replete with friends and family members, in Hitman World of Assassination\u2019s Freelancer mode, Agent 47 is more alone than usual.A sense of isolation is paramount in Freelancer, not only in tone, but in function. Whereas Agent 47 had the backing of the International Contract Agency in the vast majority of the trilogy\u2019s missions, the reticent assassin has since gone... well... freelance. Hence the need to build the safehouse and arsenal from scratch \u2014 but also the need to sift through intel on your own.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e0ca942-d2b8-4406-be8b-fc3feddeb12c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e0ca942-d2b8-4406-be8b-fc3feddeb12c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "98ddb5f0-2fae-4c5f-ad07-3b05a49d7f4f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "804757b428d07e8ca5cf3f1c33f8c970208deb24934417dc0e4188b5eb6fcd5b"}, "3": {"node_id": "30c84838-e09d-4371-b458-f157cd8b7511", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "10a16ce54ddf8fa3d7ae7b0089156465b4e4a408a683e4b2d748828820511cf2"}}, "hash": "7a53712ca591748cdfba6ef38f2e84269c75898c944116ecc979fc14b624c56f", "text": "Series mainstay Diana Burnwood is still here (and still voiced by the phenomenal Jane Perry, of course) to offer a guiding hand, praise successful missions, and bemoan your fuck-ups. But as far as choosing which four syndicates to pursue on any given run \u2014 that\u2019s on you.Herein lies the brilliant fulcrum of Freelancer mode. Each of the eight randomized syndicates (represented as tidy dossiers) has randomized optional objectives that cater to certain play styles. Complete these tasks, and you\u2019ll earn a currency called \u201cmerces,\u201d which you can spend at disguised suppliers scattered throughout each mission.These optional objectives are just as much a boon as they are a way for IO to push you out of your comfort zone. During my third campaign, I opted to hunt a human trafficker, whose optional objectives mostly revolved around pure stealth. This being my preferred play style in the base trilogy, I had few problems eliminating the low-rung syndicate members with my bare hands, hiding them in freezers, and vanishing without a trace. By the time I arrived at the Isle of Sg\u00e0il to erase the leader, I had built up a helpful assortment of lock picks, wrenches, and nonlethal poisons, and completed the job without much ado.I had also, by happenstance, added a few guns to my weapon wall, and decided to shake things up with my second syndicate: a group of arms dealers. The optional objectives for these missions required going loud, as they say \u2014 killing three guards with a shotgun, eliminating a target with a sniper rifle, and so forth. While these didn\u2019t conform to my usual methods, this syndicate would bring me to some of my favorite locations (Whittleton Creek, New York, Berlin, and the Maldives). How did it go? Not great, Bob! Because I went guns blazing at the first two locations, I spooked the higher-ups in subsequent locations. These missions gained the \u201cOn Alert\u201d status, making it far more difficult for me to sneak through them unnoticed, regardless of my disguise. I spawned in the parking garage in New York, botched a strangle attempt, and fell to the ground in a storm of lead.There\u2019s an array of other modifiers and randomized events that can pop up in each campaign, but frankly, I don\u2019t want to spoil them here. Half of the fun of Freelancer mode is breezing through one or even two syndicates, only to open your third dossier and realize how much your greed for merces has screwed you over. But you drop into the next location anyway, because improvising is half the fun \u2014 and half the comedy \u2014 of this excellent series. Hitman\u2019s Freelancer mode is something rare: an intoxicating blend of challenge and approachability. It plays on the hubris of longtime players, but also guides newcomers with thematic objectives and a more explicit overall structure. It may not allow for the micro-repetition that makes the base trilogy tick. But it does maintain a rapid momentum from the beginning of each run to its bitter, comical end. After so many hours spent with this trilogy, combing each of its locations for something, anything I missed, I did not think it possible for IO to surprise me anymore \u2014 but here we are.

Each of the missions the developer rolled out in what it calls its World of Assassination series has contained a huge, intricate collection of scripted and free-form systems that create harrowing moments, presented elaborate puzzles to solve, and allowed the player to orchestrate ludicrous and often hilarious situations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30c84838-e09d-4371-b458-f157cd8b7511": {"__data__": {"id_": "30c84838-e09d-4371-b458-f157cd8b7511", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e0ca942-d2b8-4406-be8b-fc3feddeb12c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a53712ca591748cdfba6ef38f2e84269c75898c944116ecc979fc14b624c56f"}, "3": {"node_id": "42edeaa8-61a5-402d-b23a-c226aae42f01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2e206a861424ccac4d20409fa874d76294f7d82ed17c8fee9e44f2ab449f958"}}, "hash": "10a16ce54ddf8fa3d7ae7b0089156465b4e4a408a683e4b2d748828820511cf2", "text": "Levels are designed to be played over and over so you can explore, understand, and eventually master all their moving parts, and it's impossible to see everything one has to offer in a single playthrough (or in most cases, even two or three).At first blush, Hitman 3 appears to be more of the same. It makes no drastic changes to the underlying formula, instead adding a few graphical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements to the existing Hitman framework. But Hitman 3 improves on the World of Assassination through consistently excellent level design--which is saying something, given how strong all the previous missions are. Hitman 3 is full of fun and fascinating ideas, many of which play with the concepts underpinning the last four years of Hitman levels.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Hitman 3 ReviewPresumably knowing that players have spent all sorts of time mastering its many settings and systems, IO throws in some brilliant curve balls that require you to use your assassin skills and knowledge in clever, challenging new ways.In Hitman 3, all the stealth mechanics, the ways you can interact with the world, and enemy AI remain the same as in the past. That's essential to how Hitman works, however--your knowledge and understanding of the game's underlying systems are what make it possible to replay levels again and again to exploit their intricacies in different ways. Rather than feel dated, Hitman 3 just highlights how satisfying it can be to understand how all these moving pieces work together. There aren't any major mechanical additions to the game's construction, but seeing how it all harmonizes is as impressive today as it was when the first entry in the World of Assassination trilogy launched in 2016.In each of the game's locations, your goal is to find a way to eliminate your assassination targets and then escape the level without being found out. You do that largely by knocking out enemies, hiding their bodies, and taking their clothes. Some areas are restricted based on what you're wearing, and some enemies can still see through your disguises, requiring you to carefully avoid them. Agent 47 has the benefit of Instinct, a vision mode that lets him intuit where enemies are through walls and which highlights interactive items in the environment.As you sneak around each level, your goal is to try to uncover information that will help you get close to your targets and eliminate them. Those assassinations can be accomplished in simple ways, such as shooting them or strangling them with a garrote, or more complex ones like exposing an electrical wire in a puddle and then turning on a nearby switch to electrocute your prey. The stealthier (and less deadly to non-targets) you are, the better your score at the end of a level, and each stage is full of challenges to complete that encourage you to find weird and creative ways to take out your mark, without anyone knowing you were ever there. The more challenges you complete, the more you \"master\" a level, which unlocks additional starting locations and loadout options to change the experience even more. Part of what sets Hitman 3's levels apart from those of Hitman 1 and 2 is how they fit into the overall story that IO has been telling in this series. In the past, each of Hitman's levels has functioned as a mostly standalone chapter in the tale of titular assassin Agent 47. You'd go into a location with one or more targets, and each mission had a bit of story about the people you were after, which doubled as an opportunity to get close to them.But those targets were usually somewhat tangentially related to what was going on in the unfolding story of Agent 47 and his handler, Diana Burnwood. Across Hitman 1 and 2, the pair slowly realized that they were unwitting participants in a war between the Shadow Client, a guy who was carefully manipulating them through their assassination contracts, and Providence, an Illuminati-like organization of world-controlling super-rich people. In Hitman 3, Agent 47 and Burnwood are fully involved in the battle against Providence after the events of Hitman 2, and that larger story is finally at the forefront of everything that's going on.That means that missions feel like they have a bigger impact and targets are more interesting and make more sense. The characters you eliminate have consequences for the story, and those consequences lead to imaginative takes on the series formula as 47's enemies try to fight back against him.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42edeaa8-61a5-402d-b23a-c226aae42f01": {"__data__": {"id_": "42edeaa8-61a5-402d-b23a-c226aae42f01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "30c84838-e09d-4371-b458-f157cd8b7511", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "10a16ce54ddf8fa3d7ae7b0089156465b4e4a408a683e4b2d748828820511cf2"}, "3": {"node_id": "080b7956-4a87-4044-a7ea-a4f8bf41cb0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "83399d5247bd7dc290f6b0bdf5bf2f0342c0f5448d4009bf23dffc520ec34a9f"}}, "hash": "c2e206a861424ccac4d20409fa874d76294f7d82ed17c8fee9e44f2ab449f958", "text": "After developing a brilliant mold for Hitman missions, where you're dropped into an often-huge area and have to learn to understand how it works to accomplish your goals, IO breaks that mold again and again to create fun, memorable, inventive assassination experiences.Much has already been made of the excellent second mission, set in Dartmoor, England, where you're trying to assassinate a target in the middle of what is essentially a riff on the movie Knives Out or any number of Agatha Christie stories. You're planning a murder of your own, but one has just taken place in the huge mansion where your target is staying, and you can even take on the role of private investigator and search for clues to figure out whodunit. It feels like taking a brief vacation in the middle of Hitman 3 to play another game, but the brilliance of the murder mystery's addition is that the whole time you're solving it, you're thinking about how you can use the information you learn to your advantage to finish your assassination. Your inquiry might let you expose the murderer, or frame someone else for the crime, or give you ammunition for a blackmail threat, depending on how much you explore. It's a three-dimensional chess game where you're not only putting the clues together to close the case, but also thinking ahead to what opportunities your actions might offer you, and it's an absolutely phenomenal expansion of how Hitman's intricate levels already work. Later missions also put intelligent spins on the series framework. Just about every Hitman mission up to now has given you a briefing about your targets and lets you plan your starting point and weapon loadout--so one mission robs you of all your preparatory information, dropping you into an unfamiliar location and forcing you to wing it, locating your targets and learning what you can about them on the fly. Another mission takes the things that work about Hitman--sneaking past guards, donning disguises, using the environment to distract or pacify enemies--and shrinks the scope from its normally expansive settings to a tight, crowded train, so that every move and decision you make has to be quick and calculated. There\u2019s a mission that purposely leaves you on the back foot at one point when an alarm is activated, forcing you to sneak or fight your way to safety as guards search for you.None of Hitman 3's missions change how you've played these games since 2016. They don't throw new mechanics at you (other than a camera that can scan some objects and persistent shortcuts that give you new opportunities for assassinations) or require you to learn to deal with new enemy behaviors. Instead, Hitman 3 finds new ways to challenge seasoned assassins purely through excellent design. You've honed your assassination skills--but can you solve a mystery? Can you avoid other hidden, disguised assassins hunting you? Can you sneak out of a locked-down facility full of soldiers who know you're there? It's a fitting testament to how strong the World of Assassination games have been all along that IO can make Hitman 3 feel fresh and new simply by finding creative new ways to take advantage of the series' design foundations.The drawback of Hitman 3 is that, while the missions often feel even more ambitious in intricacy than those of the past, the game itself is scaled down somewhat as an overall package. Gone are some additions that appeared in Hitman 2, including the competitive Ghost mode and cooperative Sniper Assassin missions (the Sniper Assassin missions still exist as single-player experiences, but only if you own the content from Hitman 2).There's an argument to be made that IO has maintained its focus on what people like about the series in Hitman 3 while letting experiments that worked less well fall away, but it still feels like there's a bit less game here than in the past. That said, the World of Assassination games also have excelled with their post-release content, and we know that the timed Elusive Target missions are making a return at some point, which softens the blow of multiplayer mode losses. There's also the addition of virtual reality support for PlayStation players, allowing you to play Hitman 3 in first-person mode (along with all the missions from Hitman 1 and 2, if you own them), although we played on PC and thus couldn't test it. And as with Hitman 2, Hitman 3 functions as a platform for past games' levels, so you can play everything from Hitman 1 and 2 with your new unlocked weapons and Hitman 3's improvements. Continuing to have access to all Hitman content in one place is a nice addition, although you have to have purchased it all at some point or another.What's good about Hitman--its level design and the creativity, experimentation, and exploration that affords--is great in Hitman 3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "080b7956-4a87-4044-a7ea-a4f8bf41cb0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "080b7956-4a87-4044-a7ea-a4f8bf41cb0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "42edeaa8-61a5-402d-b23a-c226aae42f01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2e206a861424ccac4d20409fa874d76294f7d82ed17c8fee9e44f2ab449f958"}, "3": {"node_id": "14795429-4161-4fbc-ad85-9a3aab364705", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4964df890c657ebd8afd25f918d75b783b6a49297107ea7a63a532fa5adf30f9"}}, "hash": "83399d5247bd7dc290f6b0bdf5bf2f0342c0f5448d4009bf23dffc520ec34a9f", "text": "It closes out the trilogy by brilliantly playing off everything that came before it, making use of and then subverting expectations, and rewarding players for their willingness to master the complexity of both its individual levels and the series as a whole.

But there\u2019s something fascinating and, for this franchise, novel about Hitman 3, the final entry in IO Interactive\u2019s World of Assassination trilogy: The story that the game\u2019s writers have crafted matters at least as much as Hitman\u2019s play-it-your-way spirit.IO has said that it considers certain assassinations to be the \u201ccanonical\u201d endings for some of this trilogy\u2019s missions. That\u2019s never been more true than in Hitman 3, which occasionally signals that it wants you to make a particular decision, and reinforces it with a cutscene afterward that follows directly from the choice in question.Of course, the push and pull between interactivity and authored narrative plays on the essence of 47\u2019s job itself: He is a laboratory-engineered contract killer, designed to be the perfect hired gun, always carrying out someone else\u2019s orders rather than acting of his own volition.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Indeed, IO\u2019s entire trilogy touches on ideas of power, control, and self-determination. The group known in the games\u2019 fiction as Providence is a global cabal of elites who shape world events from behind the scenes; the organization\u2019s ethos is that it must guide the course of history because the masses are incapable of choosing the right path themselves. But what happens when some of the blunt tools through which Providence wields its extraordinary power \u2014 47 and his long-lost friend Lucas Grey, a fellow trained assassin \u2014 gain an understanding of their humanity, and seek to exercise free will?This is heady stuff for a video game franchise that alternates between operatic drama and goofy hijinks, and it has mostly remained in the background until now. Hitman 3 plays it up, making for a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy. The game is remarkable not just for its masterful level design and its penchant for turning familiar elements of the series on their heads, but for how skillfully it brings to bear the accumulated weight of its characters\u2019 actions \u2014 and brings it crashing down on their heads with devastating consequences.If it seems surprising to spend so much time in a review of a Hitman game talking about its story, well, I\u2019m right there with you. It was so convoluted and barely comprehensible in 2016\u2019s episodic Hitman that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to care. In Hitman 2, the writers spent more time developing the characters, not merely tossing in ha-that\u2019s-neat references and callbacks to the events of the preceding game. It\u2019s tough to build sympathy for a couple of cold-blooded killers, but IO managed to do so with key revelations about 47\u2019s early life, his childhood friendship with Grey, and his relationship with his handler, Diana Burnwood.For people new to Hitman, the ideal way to experience the World of Assassination trilogy is to play through all three games in Hitman 3. IO Interactive has spruced up the locations from the first two titles with the third game\u2019s improved graphics, animation, and AI. I returned to Hitman\u2019s very first level, Paris, and was stunned by the appearance of beautiful reflections on nearly every shiny surface, such as the glossy hardwood floors of the museum at which the mission takes place.\u00a0I also loved being able to play through past locations with all of my progression tracked in one place. In the preview build of Hitman 3 that I played for my impressions piece earlier this month, I completed the first four missions of Hitman in addition to the first two of Hitman 3, bringing my profile all the way up to level 73. And I unlocked a Burj al-Ghazali snow globe in Dubai that I could use in any other location in the trilogy!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14795429-4161-4fbc-ad85-9a3aab364705": {"__data__": {"id_": "14795429-4161-4fbc-ad85-9a3aab364705", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "080b7956-4a87-4044-a7ea-a4f8bf41cb0f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "83399d5247bd7dc290f6b0bdf5bf2f0342c0f5448d4009bf23dffc520ec34a9f"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e82aa52-8eae-4e06-aec0-b2e1a4126204", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c28ca63b6b315507ceb0113cf13d5c1911c636724a46a35e8425f2429ba7549"}}, "hash": "4964df890c657ebd8afd25f918d75b783b6a49297107ea7a63a532fa5adf30f9", "text": "(I was unable to test the feature that allows players to import progression and unlocks from Hitman 2, because it relies on an IO Interactive website that is not yet active, and anyway, I played the first two games on consoles.)Running Hitman 3 on a PC with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super GPU, an Intel Core i5-7500 processor, and 16 GB of RAM, I was able to play on max settings at 60 frames per second \u2014 with some drops to the mid-40s in certain areas, and a few rare instances of extreme stuttering \u2014 at my monitor\u2019s native resolution of 1920x1200.I did run into some apparent bugs with not getting credit for certain challenges, like one in which you have to take a photo during a family meeting in Dartmoor and another in Mendoza that asks you to pacify someone with a particular item. But the most annoying issue for me was how often Hitman 3 pings its servers. My internet connection was stable, but these check-ins would occasionally halt the experience with a pop-up and sometimes even tell me that the game was disconnected from the servers. Most notably, this happened during the game\u2019s final cinematic \u2014 which caused the cutscene to end prematurely and transition to the credits.Hitman 2 ended on a high note, with Agent 47 and his cohorts managing to capture Arthur Edwards, aka the Constant. This figure works for the Providence Partners, the three leaders of the secret society, who all come from old-money families. At the start of Hitman 3, 47\u2019s team intends to extract information from the Constant so the group can take out the Partners and destroy Providence. But Edwards is a master manipulator, and he has a few tricks left up his sleeve.Hitman 3 weaves a globe-trotting tale featuring many hallmarks of the spy genre. Trust is a tenuous, risky concept, and allegiances are liable to change at a moment\u2019s notice. Do the members of Providence have the luxury of trusting anyone? Diana has nurtured and guided 47\u2019s growth as an assassin, but is she using him for her own ends?It\u2019s only natural for IO to have foregrounded the story as it brought the trilogy to its thrilling end. Moreover, the story is the driving force behind the way you actually play Hitman 3.Of the six missions in Hitman 3 \u2014 set in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Dartmoor, U.K.; Berlin; Chongqing, China; Mendoza, Argentina; and Romania\u2019s Carpathian Mountains \u2014 only two begin in traditional Hitman fashion, with 47 simply showing up at a location, ready to get to work. The other missions grabbed me and didn\u2019t let go by way of unconventional introductions, like a vertigo-inducing infiltration of the world\u2019s tallest building and an unsettling nighttime exploration of a deserted gas station. I also delighted in being challenged to think on my feet more, as 47 often had to start a mission without his usual gear or concealed weapon. And when a story turn altered the standard handler/assassin setup, I realized just how much I had grown accustomed over the past two games to Diana\u2019s lively, suggestive narration and to the crutch of a detailed briefing on the mission\u2019s targets.IO also delivers new levels of free-form assassination in Hitman 3, impressive even for a franchise renowned for its sandbox environments. \u201cApex Predator,\u201d which takes place around an underground dance club in an industrial zone on the outskirts of Berlin, is a highlight in this respect. It surprised me at every turn, dropping me off in a strange place without any briefing or weapons and forcing me to improvise. As I explored the area, gained intel, and figured out who my targets were, my objectives evolved. This mission comes at a point in the campaign where it feels like 47 has been pitted against the world; it\u2019s a terrific synthesis of story and gameplay.Argentina\u2019s \u201cThe Farewell\u201d isn\u2019t the final mission of Hitman 3, but it feels like a culmination of everything the franchise has been building toward \u2014 like IO wanted to turn all the dials up to 11. The Mendoza location itself is a sprawling playground: an opulent retirement gala set at a winery built into a cliff, with vineyards stretching toward a lakeside town in the distance and a villa overlooking it all. For the first time, Diana herself is in play, and potentially in danger. Mendoza contains what is now, I think, my favorite assassination in the entire Hitman franchise.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e82aa52-8eae-4e06-aec0-b2e1a4126204": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e82aa52-8eae-4e06-aec0-b2e1a4126204", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "14795429-4161-4fbc-ad85-9a3aab364705", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4964df890c657ebd8afd25f918d75b783b6a49297107ea7a63a532fa5adf30f9"}, "3": {"node_id": "aa709524-8c4e-41af-bf81-afd08ee029f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d8dc9c0e1890ae7e924c5b6bd36c41545ed9a88bf947af4331eff14fa510104"}}, "hash": "1c28ca63b6b315507ceb0113cf13d5c1911c636724a46a35e8425f2429ba7549", "text": "All I will say is that it involves winemaking machinery and some ... assistance.The mission also makes perhaps the best use of a few mechanics that are new to Hitman 3: security keypads, time limitations, and 47\u2019s camera/scanner. All of those elements converge if you choose to attempt the daring theft of a priceless bottle of wine: I had to disable security measures at a computer terminal, then run downstairs within one minute \u2014 as an on-screen timer counted down the seconds before the security would be reactivated \u2014 and punch in a four-digit code to access the chamber holding the bottle. (I had overheard the code when I broke into the venting corridors below the room, a feat I accomplished by using the scanner to hack the tunnels\u2019 access doors.) It all made me feel like a badass super spy.Hitman 3 gameplay preview: Dubai, Dartmoor levels are a terrific startThat\u2019s not to say the other locations lack stunning vistas or incredible level design, whether it\u2019s a rain-soaked, neon-lit district of Chongqing, and the verticality of its densely packed buildings, or the secrets in the walls of Dartmoor\u2019s Thornbridge Manor. The lone exception is the epilogue in Romania, which is disappointing in how circumscribed the experience is, playing out more like a certain Bong Joon Ho film than a typical Hitman level. Yet it still makes room for a couple of Hitman 3\u2019s persistent shortcuts \u2014 doors (and, in some places, ladders) that must be unlocked from one side and will remain available in future playthroughs once unlocked. I can\u2019t wait to revisit the game and try to speedrun missions with the help of these pathways.I don\u2019t want to overstate the degree to which Hitman 3 is a departure from its predecessors. The moment-to-moment gameplay remains focused on Agent 47 sneaking past people (or donning disguises to hide in plain view) so he can put himself in position to commit murder. In some sense, it is a sequel very much like Hitman 2, with new targets to take down in six new locations, and some additional toys and tactics with which 47 can accomplish his goals. But I very much appreciated the twists and wrinkles that IO threw into the Hitman formula this time around, many of them steered by the story.That\u2019s a clear sign that in concluding its beloved trilogy, IO felt it necessary to exert a stronger degree of narrative control and prioritize its own story over the open-ended nature of Hitman. The studio put a heavier hand on the wheel, but the trade-off is absolutely worth it.Deciding the answers to these big game design questions is the kind of thing you can do when you return to being an independent studio, and gain the self-determination to tell the story you want to tell while staying true to the franchise you\u2019ve been working on for more than two decades. I\u2019m amazed that IO pulled off that delicate balancing act in Agent 47\u2019s finest adventure to date. Hitman 3 will be released Jan. 20 on Google Stadia, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.

After birthing the series in 2000 and becoming synonymous with it since, IO Interactive is letting Agent 47 kick up his feet and have some well-deserved time off from all the coordinated killing. But his looming retirement has not dulled his killer instinct as Hitman 3 is one of his best contracts in the past two decades.It achieves such highs by knowing when to utilize Hitman\u2019s strengths, when to deviate from them, and when to mix them around. Hitman 3, in typical Hitman fashion, takes 47 to a handful of exotic locations around the world. These exquisitely rendered locales are immensely dense, lived-in areas full of different subsections that all intelligently weave in and around each other somewhat like a Soulslike game.IO has shown its mastery in that regard and it\u2019s truly remarkable how the team can continually explore new territories while also maintaining such a high level of quality.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa709524-8c4e-41af-bf81-afd08ee029f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa709524-8c4e-41af-bf81-afd08ee029f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e82aa52-8eae-4e06-aec0-b2e1a4126204", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c28ca63b6b315507ceb0113cf13d5c1911c636724a46a35e8425f2429ba7549"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ccf15db-9e59-401d-8c71-f15e709b91ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "58855ca88f882ed5784247ad3c312c767c1570ae35cb1fa053d5ba86216cf08a"}}, "hash": "1d8dc9c0e1890ae7e924c5b6bd36c41545ed9a88bf947af4331eff14fa510104", "text": "For example, the old rural English mansion is wildly different from the gorgeous, neon-soaked streets of Chongqing and both even exhibit their depth in their own ways. The manor is stacked with multiple, detailed floors with its own smaller side areas while the Chongqing map is more about a few medium-sized facilities and how they link together.All of the maps find ways to express themselves differently both aesthetically and architecturally like this to great effect. Its array of unique atmospheres make Hitman 3 a pretty game that, like the protagonist himself, can take many distinct forms and its architecture gives 47 the playground he needs to do what he does best: murder without restraint. The targets in each mission can be shot, burned, stabbed, blown up, or crushed in an uncountable amount of ways and all rely on the player\u2019s wit and exploration skills. Levels are brimming with ways to assassinate and that freedom is still unmatched, especially the satisfying special or accidental kills that are filled with IO\u2019s signature dark humor.Jamming a ton of different toys and opportunities into each stage organically makes them so replayable, too. Whacking a target is then followed up by all the \u201cwhat if\u201d assassinations that could have been. Numerous challenges and unlocks extrinsically motivate players to experiment while the joy of finding and performing them is the intrinsic reward, both of which work together in harmony to make Hitman 3 almost endlessly replayable.While IO deserves credit for maintaining that level of quality, unparalleled openness, replayability, and detailed sandbox level design are carryovers from the last two games. IO instead chose to innovate in how it doles out assassinations. Only two of the six stages are more typical Hitman missions where 47 is dropped in an area with a couple of targets, meaning that the other four take that idea and mix it around. The best of these ideas, like the oft-discussed Knives Out-esque murder mystery, take the core of Hitman and cleverly put those mechanics in a different context. Meticulously searching around is inherent to Hitman so it\u2019s only natural to use those same skills to solve a murder rather than commit one.Most of these unexpected wrinkles work out well, but a couple of them butt up against what Hitman stands for and suffer a bit because of it. Two of these changes are unexpectedly narrow, funneling a classically freeform series into something rather strict and comparatively less fulfilling. Serving the narrative has its positives and these sections are fine, but sacrificing such a core element of the series drags these parts down.Hitman 3 has more than enough classic Hitman to make up for these slight deviations, especially since it carries over the entirety of the prior two entries (if players have purchased them). This approach does limit what new things Hitman 3 can do, which is slightly disappointing. However, it also allows the game to live under one digital roof where all three games coalesce into one big (and thankfully, compressed) launcher. Sequels usually replace their predecessors but they all sit alongside one another here with the same profile level and all of the added UI touches and enhancements from the most recent installment. Hitman 3 is an inclusive and forward-thinking culmination of this great \u201cWorld of Assassination\u201d idea.The aforementioned limits mean Hitman 3 doesn\u2019t have many big new features it can tout. Unlockable persistent shortcuts work with the game\u2019s commitment to replayability and the new hacking camera has its uses (particularly during the murder mystery), but they are more small improvements over sequel-ready upgrades. Hitman 2 contained some meaningful changes \u2014 like working mirrors, a bigger stashing briefcase, and hiding in crowds \u2014 and Hitman 3 doesn\u2019t offer a similar list of improvements. Virtual reality is admittedly new for the series, but that\u2019s not something many people are going to experience as, on top of VR\u2019s built-in niche appeal, it\u2019s exclusive to the PS4 version (at least, for the time being).Hitman 3 does add to the narrative though. It doesn\u2019t do a great job of catching players up to its dense yet brief story, but it continually raises the stakes and places Agent 47 and Diana Burnwood in some tense scenarios, adding even more motivation to each mission. IO cashes in on their long history together and finds an emotional core that carries the story along, which is ironic for such an emotionless protagonist like 47.Hitman 3\u2019s story reflects IO\u2019s time with the franchise as even skilled professionals must eventually move on and carve a new path for themselves. IO will be focusing its efforts elsewhere for the near future but it has at least left Hitman on a particularly high note.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ccf15db-9e59-401d-8c71-f15e709b91ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ccf15db-9e59-401d-8c71-f15e709b91ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa709524-8c4e-41af-bf81-afd08ee029f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d8dc9c0e1890ae7e924c5b6bd36c41545ed9a88bf947af4331eff14fa510104"}, "3": {"node_id": "32005da6-8bf9-482d-a964-5b76f5807636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "940267ee1056b39a51aa4eac2fc70f6e26b1dcd6c6d626daf617bd69ee57dcd0"}}, "hash": "58855ca88f882ed5784247ad3c312c767c1570ae35cb1fa053d5ba86216cf08a", "text": "A suite of rich and highly detailed levels, open-ended mission design, and nearly endless replayability allow it to excel off its own merits, but easy access to the prior two entries makes Hitman 3 the ultimate Hitman experience that puts all of the trilogy\u2019s successes under one poison-tipped umbrella.

Backstage access, elaborate mezzanines; this is a flashy stage and it wants you to know it at all times.It\u2019s also very well paced. Those geographical restrictions I mentioned? They open up over time as you complete each playthrough of Dubai, but also help acclimate brand new players on a semi-guided, but definitely not linear first hunt. It also gives the rest of the game plenty of room to breathe going forward.IO Interactive was already good at this: but they\u2019re getting better.Dartmoor, United KingdomDonning his best Sherlock cap (or\u00a0Benoit Blanc/Hercule Poirot outfit), Agent 47 is whisked away to the dreary countryside of Dartmoor for a murder mystery affair. Egad!Once again, IO Interactive nails it here. They\u2019ve gone directly from a bright and larger-than-life Dubai skyscraper to a down-to-earth, but still out-there concept. It goes to show you that the studio is not resting on their laurels, or saving the best for last.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32005da6-8bf9-482d-a964-5b76f5807636": {"__data__": {"id_": "32005da6-8bf9-482d-a964-5b76f5807636", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ccf15db-9e59-401d-8c71-f15e709b91ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "58855ca88f882ed5784247ad3c312c767c1570ae35cb1fa053d5ba86216cf08a"}, "3": {"node_id": "20c1cc9e-4984-406c-a4ad-dfa0df25d4d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "693c58a2eef3680d7e31e2be34b95f6fd9248d6e30b7c1eb7d577d168f243486"}}, "hash": "940267ee1056b39a51aa4eac2fc70f6e26b1dcd6c6d626daf617bd69ee57dcd0", "text": "They\u2019re willing to provide worthwhile scenarios at a regular pace, and Dartmoor is one of my favorites of the bunch.While I\u2019m going to refrain from spoiling anything here (and there\u2019s a lot to spoil), Dartmoor is easily one of the best cases for IO Interactive\u2019s penchant for environmental storytelling. There\u2019s so much to discover and glean here in this mansion journey, from the inner workings of familial lore to the tale of the house itself.I found myself going back to this one immediately after clearing it.Berlin, GermanyAt this point the stakes get a little higher, story-wise, and the tension is ramping up. It colors the significance of Berlin within the confines of the campaign.This one is a little more lawless. There\u2019s multiple factions at play (security, agents, bikers, civilians) and they\u2019re all kind of scrunched together to create a chaotic, more intimate map. And not every Hitman map needs to be bright! Even if those are among my favorites (Miami immediately comes to mind from Hitman 2 \u2013 something I played in\u00a0Hitman 3\u00a0again actually, as the package allows you to select previously owned games).It\u2019s probably the least flashy bit of Hitman 3, but again, the narrative significance of it adds to the heightened severity of it. It fits.Chongqing, ChinaAh, neon. Berlin had some, but not nearly enough. Chongqing fixes that.With the setup of \u201c2.5 million cameras\u201d watching your every move,\u00a0Chongqing hits that theme fantasy right away of whisking you away to a unique land; but also comes in swinging with a variety of locations to explore that keep things fresh, even on that first run. A giant underground bunker is a classic Hitman\u00a0fixture, housed below a semi-bustling city that has more than enough nuances to justify replays.It\u2019s a keeper.Mendoza, ArgentinaAt this point the story is winding down, but it still isn\u2019t completely in the way. Despite the enhanced focus on Agent 47 and the people who surround him, the objectives mostly remain the same. It\u2019s a positive in my mind, because the formula still works best when it plays up its sandboxes first and foremost.I intimated the James Bond references earlier, but this is 47 at his most 007. Mendoza\u2019s wine country is a classy affair, a far cry from the rainy streets of\u00a0Chongqing, or even the shiny artifice of Mumbai. No, this is more of an idyllic, rural take: a level befitting of the penultimate stage.It might be a bit on the small side as far as substantial zones go, but it\u2019s one of the most memorable, visually.Carpathian Mountains, RomaniaIt\u2019s really hard to talk about this one without spoiling it (I\u2019m sure someone will), but it\u2019s enrobed in story bits and does feel like a proper trilogy finale. It\u2019s also the most linear stage of the bunch, so just be ready for that.If you muck about in each map and take things slowly, you can allot about an hour a level to clear the game: so roughly six hours in all. But Hitman\u00a0is predicated on replay value, and Hitman 3\u00a0nudges things even further down that path. Shortcuts are probably the biggest draw, which alter each sandbox to make them a little more accessible.Basically, if you lower a specially marked ladder or some other device, you can access that shortcut on future playthroughs. It\u2019s very subtle; but it\u2019s a welcome change as it ensures that you can explore the sandbox the way you want to each time. I would refrain from using the phrase \u201cguided,\u201d but the first run is definitely angled in such a way to make it feel more cinematic in nature. With shortcuts, branching paths allow you to see the entirety of the design in all its splendor. This is on top of the existing \u201cstarting locations\u201d system, mind.Coupled with extra gadgets (some of which can be imported \u2013 though not as swimmingly on PC), Hitman 3\u00a0is really fun to dive back into; or introduce someone to for that matter, just to see what they come up with. It\u2019s the little things that add up and really make Hitman 3\u00a0special.Hats off to IO Interactive for really sticking with this series and getting it right.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

Hitman 3 is less of a full new idea, more of a continuation, expansion and refinement of the ideas present in Hitman 2. But then, you run into another problem with nomenclature, which is that Hitman 2 was already basically Hitman 1.5, a continuation, expansion, and refinement of Hitman. So if we\u2019re going by decimals, that would make Hitman 3 into Hitman 2, I guess? Hitman 1.75, perhaps, asymptotically approaching something like a numbered sequel. Of course, it\u2019s all nonsense: this was always only ever one game, released in 3 parts over 4 years: Hitman: World of Assassination.Thankfully, it is one of the best games ever made.Fans of the series\u2014or the game, if we\u2019re going to stick with that\u2014will be right at home from the first moments of Hitman 3. Despite all the plot machinations ticking behind the curtain, the opening level is as familiar as the Paris level from back in 2016. We are set to infiltrate a fancy party at the top of the world, a Dubai skyscraper the inside of which lowly peasants will only ever see if they are working there, or, in particular but hardly unique circumstances, trying to kill someone there. We have two targets: one that mills around in plain view, inviting poison and accidents, and one that sits above in a secure location, requiring tricky stealth or elaborate disguises to access.From there, we play, donning and shedding disguises at will, moving through this lethal version of Upstairs/Downstairs as we engineer poetic accidents or outright brutality to bring our targets down. We play and play again, this time engineering our targets into the same room to be killed at once, this other time pretending to be a new bodyguard to get one of them alone, or a chef with access to lethal poison and an accelerated egg timer. Repetition is the name of the game, turning this playground of unhappy accidents and class conflict inside and out until you can play it blindfolded. A nice little addition this time around is shortcuts: persistent ladders and the like you can unlock in one playthrough and use in the next, opening the door to more efficient sneaking every time.This is the basic formula of this game, one that remains essentially untouched until the last level, but not without interesting experimentation. One such moment comes in the next level, offering a one target, more constrained experience with a singular, involved \u201cmission story\u201d that\u2019s clearly meant to dominate your first playthrough. It\u2019s a Knives Out-style murder mystery where you play the detective (so long as you knock him out and take his clothes as he stops to catch his breath in front of the conveniently-placed, totally unobserved closet).

He turns the tables on them, listening into their conversations to eliminate each in turn with a little more improvisation than those other levels, taking out 5 before their handler calls the operation off. There is room for near-infinite experimentation with none of the formula in some of the other levels: taking out one target might be as simple as distracting his friend before shoving him over the railing, or maybe the classic \u201cbroken extension cord in a puddle\u201d trick. I threw a sniper of the roof before making handy use of the weapon he left behind: it goes on. And, as always, you can always engineer every target into the same location at once, though this time they\u2019re ready for you.That\u2019s three levels: there are only 6 here, which might seem slim if you haven\u2019t played the game before and don\u2019t know just how deep these go. Two more are straightforward: a gorgeous, rain-drenched neon noir with a touch of Cyberpunk, the other a fancy party at a vineyard, as traditional and expansive as a Hitman level can be. Would you like to electrocute an aristocrat in a huge puddle of his own spilled wine? Nah, I\u2019d rather crush him along with the year\u2019s harvest. 47 is dead serious, whether he\u2019s wearing a tailored suit or a chicken costume, but the game deploys humor better than nearly any other AAA title.It\u2019s the last level where the game stumbles, and it points out the biggest weakness along the way: this game is meant to be the conclusion to the convoluted story of the previous two games, and that means that there is, necessarily, a lot more story poking its way into these levels. I have never been interested in this and I\u2019m still not, and it can\u2019t be ignored in the last level, which is literally a train, forcing you from one car to the next as you get to to the single, inevitable end. It even allows you to kill enemies besides the target, anathema to the series as it stands.The game falls prey to this particular problem again in an earlier level, where no matter how you go about it it always ends in a specific, scripted manhunt. Hitman can abide scripting, but only so much. I get it: the developers had an idea, and executed it fine. It\u2019s just that the idea runs counter to what makes the game great.So it\u2019s 5 levels really, but they are excellent levels, masterful executions of a brilliant concept by a team at the top of their game. And, on top of that, we\u2019ve already got the other two games\u2014which are available for dirt cheap, now\u2014to make a single, expansive, globetrotting experience that sees our familiar, baldheaded puppetmaster accessing the world\u2019s ultra-wealthy just when they thought they were invincible, dancing through the class divides like the nameless angel of death that he is, and then blowing someone up with an exploding golf ball or something.If I were reviewing Hitman: World of Assassination (a game which does not yet exist but will almost certainly be released by this time next year), I would give it a 10: more than the sum of its parts, a triumph of world-building and design unlike anything else in the industry. But it\u2019s just Hitman 3, and so I\u2019ve got to dock it for allowing its convoluted story to interfere with what it does best.I do not think it is a spoiler to say that the game ends with 47 triumphant, ready to continue assassinating wealthy monsters with none of the baggage of the story so far. Which is all I\u2019ve ever wanted to do. I hope that either the upcoming James Bond game channels this energy, or that IO continues making more Hitman either concurrently or afterwards, because I will never have enough.IO provided a review code for the Xbox version of this game.\nShacknews, New to Shacknews?

Each level was packed with interesting NPCs and side stories, and the developer continuously pumped fresh content into the experience to ensure players were never bored. This continued all the way through 2020 and the complete life cycle of 2018\u2019s Hitman 2.With Hitman 3, IO Interactive is looking to close out the World of Assassination trilogy that began in 2016 and wrap up the story of Agent 47, Diana, Lucas Grey, and their fight against Providence, a powerful organization playing puppet master with the rest of the world. The same open design has returned, but there is a heavier focus on storytelling than the previous two games. This, along with the inclusion of the camera, permanent shortcuts, and new weapons and gadgets, keeps the experience fresh without losing sight of what the series has become.Hitman 3 kicks off with Agent 47 visiting Dubai and the world\u2019s tallest building to eliminate two targets associated with Providence. Right away, the game starts to showcase the new features, gently guiding the player to make use of the camera, as well as having Agent 47 interact with a keypad. Both features are new to the World of Assassination trilogy, as are permanent shortcuts. These are instances where Agent 47 can open a door or drop a ladder that he can access in future runs to get where he needs to go faster or create more unique assassination opportunities. In the case of Dubai, I was able to drop two ladders that allowed me to get a four-minute Silent Assassin, Suit Only run when replaying the level. The high of studying my target's routines and working out the timing paid off after I made use of the new ICA Remote Micro Taser, dropping it in a pool of water and setting it off when my target walked through.I was able to do the same thing with permanent shortcuts in Hitman 3\u2019s second location, Dartmoor. Dartmoor is a top-three destination for me across the entire trilogy and comes complete with its own murder mystery that had me so captivated I pushed killing my target to the back burner. I could have killed her a dozen times and didn\u2019t bother. I had more important matters at hand. In fact, by the time I was ready to off the nasty old lady that Diana put in my crosshairs, her bodyguards were all sawing logs in bins around the level and she was wandering about completely unguarded. I\u2019m shocked she didn\u2019t die of old age based on how long it took me to finish the job.The Hitman 3 base game comes with six main missions with cinematics sprinkled between them to tell the story IO Interactive has cooked up. This is no different from the previous two games, but players can expect to be a bit restricted on their first runs, as loadouts are frequently disabled to allow the story to properly unfold. The good news is, this is only an issue on a first playthrough, as loadout slots, unique starting points, and smuggling opportunities are all back and available after a first completion.The progression system is largely unchanged but has been tweaked a little. Completing challenges within a level will award points towards a destination\u2019s mastery. Each mastery level achieved will provide some type of unlock, be it a smuggle point, unique starting location, or weapons and gadgets. Missing from Hitman 3 is a one-sheet that shows players everything they haven\u2019t unlocked and how to obtain it, but the classic challenges are more streamlined than previous games and should make unlocking some cool gear a little more straightforward. The post-mission screen will also give players a playstyle rating, which is a unique title the game assigns based on the actions taken in the previous mission.Once I\u2019d worked my way through each mission to complete the Hitman 3 story \u2014 a task that players can expect to take less than 10 hours \u2014 I returned to each location to finish mission stories, challenges, and mastery levels of each destination for the weapon and gear unlocks. This is where the game opens up and really begins to shine, which is true about Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2 as well. Nothing beats playing through each of the opportunities and spending time mastering each level to create new ways to kill each target, or finding a disguise that let\u2019s Agent 47 walk around like he owns the place. However, I preferred doing this in the two previous games, as there are levels \u2014 plural \u2014 in Hitman 3 where Agent 47 must retrieve something in addition to killing his targets, and another mission that is somewhat linear. There\u2019s a mentality in me as a player that once I eliminate my targets it\u2019s time to GTFO, and that isn\u2019t always possible here.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0031609-a922-4bba-a9ff-fab53c3c6362": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0031609-a922-4bba-a9ff-fab53c3c6362", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead95548-918e-4e41-86df-8834d368f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695b4a36839bf3ff4c4eb2d861c2ab3d73c27fa31fe0608c138e6c375c6025f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "3afed1a9-864d-4b51-9b59-7302231101d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6295db0691d91fa770954d9f09499c8dbbc4e32098f36cc19c27ddc23e07b173"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ac0133d-28d2-4952-8c8f-1c4b988e5760", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f93e4f9da91c290863386abebbebdc91bd23f4df2acdec441821507bf78eb375"}}, "hash": "63f86265ed1f1c510e25de1fe2475d28275edcd0f9810aa98aae77e0f8c98594", "text": "It\u2019s not unlike Sapienza from Hitman (2016) in that some of the creativity of killing targets is lost when you must detour to a different part of the map to pick up a piece of paper.While I enjoyed every level of Hitman 3 on my initial playthrough and some on subsequent runs, my review copy of Hitman 3 included Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2. I found myself wanting to go back and play those levels as much as I did the new ones, and I think Hitman 3 could miss its mark with players who don\u2019t own the previous two titles. Part of what has made the franchise such a win for me over the last four years is being able to use all my unlocks on any level across two games. Anyone who buys only Hitman 3 will have six destinations and far less gizmos and gadgets to call on, and I think the overall experience could end up lacking for those that don\u2019t own the full package.Visually, Hitman 3 and all its destinations look amazing. My copy was for PC and I was able to crank every graphical setting and maintain more than 100 frames per second with a 2560x1440 (2K) resolution. I was able to take advantage of the gorgeous graphics thanks to the PC version having NVIDIA Ansel support, allowing players to take in-game HUD-less screen shots without a built-in photo mode. Hitman 3 also features several graphical enhancements, including ray tracing and improved lighting, which was especially easy to spot under the neon lights of the Chongqing destination.Complementing incredible visuals is the stellar sound design, whether it\u2019s an NPC conversation or environmental sounds. The acting for both Diana and Agent 47 is masterfully done, as it is with many of the targets and NPCs throughout the experience. The best part of the sound, though, is often the music that captures the mood of a certain level, or the humorous dialog between two NPCs. Players will have hours of fun just listening in on random conversations throughout each of the levels, and there is always a feeling that each location is alive with everything that can be heard at any given time. Stand in the middle of the crowd in Dubai and just listen to how cool it all sounds.While I enjoyed the conclusion to the World of Assassination trilogy\u2019s narrative, the best that Hitman 3 has to offer is when it sets players loose in its levels to be creative and explore. Nothing beats the process of plotting out a potential route, working out the various pieces by saving and loading repeatedly, then finally putting it all together in that perfect run. That\u2019s still there in Hitman 3 as it was previously, but each time a mission asked me to retrieve something it felt like a chore after my first run. Still, it offers players a huge amount of content if they don\u2019t expect to experience it all on a single run. It\u2019s a game that\u2019s meant to be played repeatedly, and it benefits from the addition of the camera and the permanent shortcuts. It\u2019s great on its own, but combined with Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2 it helps make up the masterpiece that is the World of Assassination trilogy.This review is based on a PC review copy provided by the publisher.
