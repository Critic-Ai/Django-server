that the threads of our lives are already woven like strands in a collective tapestry. Where your own thread encounters others, even where it ends, are points in history already sewn together by the Fates. But the Vikings also believed in an idea of free will, in the possibility to see the path prophecy might have chosen and the ability to resist it, to fight for your own destiny and the destinies of those whose lives you might touch. Such ideas run through the brilliant narrative of Assassin's Creed Valhalla and the life of its heroine Eivor, to lift this beautiful game into a saga for the ages. A Viking-set Assassin's Creed is a perfect setting for a series which has always been obsessed by the ideas of order versus resistance, of Assassins versus Templars (or again here, in this third chapter set in ancient times, the Hidden Ones versus the Order of the Ancients). It's also a perfect setup for whatever kind of Assassin's Creed game you're looking for - one which involves some wonky sci-fi shenanigans and fun mythological elements or simply a 60-hour Viking tale about knocking English heads together. Valhalla protagonist Eivor is a very likable Viking, a level-headed conqueror suddenly set on a path for England in search of a new home and in support of her clan. There was always going to be a tension between the popular view of Vikings as only raiders and pillagers rather than the settlers they were also - but Eivor's story and search for her own brand of peace smooths away this tension as much as possible. Over the course of her quest around the kingdoms, her task is to unite more than it is to divide - something underpinned by your regular returns to the settlement of Ravensthorpe, a place you'll help grow into a home for a diverse cast of characters. It's not perfect - smashing up monasteries simply to build huts in your hometown and only slaying soldiers, rather than monks, is pure video game logic - but as far as Valhalla's charismatic and wonderfully dry main character is concerned, Eivor does enough to carry the story through. Much has been made of the option to play Eivor as either male or female - a first for the Assassin's Creed series - and in particular of Valhalla's default choice which has the game pick this for you at specific points. With hindsight, knowing the narrative reason for this and seeing its overall impact on the vast, vast percentage of the experience, this option is actually the one I'd recommend - at least until the game swaps who you're playing as for the first time, or it finally clicks for you as to why it does. Suffice to say this option never impacted my attachment to the Eivor I played as across the majority of the game, and it is not the situation some had expected, where your immersion could be broken by a constant ping-pong back and forth. Your version of Eivor - their life, their choices and their relationships - is never detracted from, something that had been a valid concern. This option also has wider - and ultimately, I believe, positive - implications in the struggle to see better female representation in the Assassin's Creed series - something pushed for by Ubisoft's own developers as well as fans, especially in a game that is still overwhelmingly being marketed with its male option front and centre. Eivor's story thread involves a prophecy she will eventually betray Sigurd, her brother and clan leader, something initially as unthinkable to her as the idea their collective glories won't earn them a place side-by-side in Valhalla. Their bond is strong, forged amongst family tragedy and the need to survive in new lands, but slowly the threads binding the siblings begin to fray. There are many hours of story and several key characters that play a part in this, and while it's a tale best left to be unravelled by yourself as much as possible, it's a changing relationship that is well paced. As Eivor, I was the one journeying the land to form alliances and grow our settlement while Sigurd was off messing around with Basim, his new assassin buddy. Whenever Sigurd disappeared off-screen for several hours, I would wonder what he was up to, and when he popped up again, I wouldn't always like what I heard.Eivor's path towards this reckoning is one she walks alongside the mysterious figure of Odin, someone she has a peculiarly close connection with.

It's smartly-plotted stuff, couched in just the right way so it never feels too out of place, while acting like a mythological story add-on woven directly into the base game. For those who enjoyed the more experimental and varied environments found in Odyssey's excellent Atlantis expansion, Asgard and Jotunheim are built in much the same vein. Finally, it's worth mentioning what's going on outside of the Animus, where there's a quick conclusion to the ongoing story of Layla Hassan, the character you played in the modern day sections of the two previous games, Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey. It's 2020, the pandemic is real, and on top of that there's another newly-prophesied threat to stop, similar to the impending solar flare back in the series' Desmond era. As ever, the answers lie back in the past and specifically, in Eivor's story. Can this trio of characters - Eivor, Odin, Layla - unpick the threads of their fates? That is the story Valhalla tells and ultimately answers in a more cohesive way than the splayed story threads of Odyssey's own trio of plotlines (and for those who just want to play the historical stuff, rest assured that remains the overwhelming focus). But while there are similarities to Odyssey in the shape of Valhalla's story, there are some key differences in how it is told. I had expected Valhalla to stick to the formula of Ubisoft Quebec's very popular predecessor, but the Origins team at Ubisoft Montreal has come up with something much closer to its own previous Ancient Egypt-set chapter. Where Odyssey offered branching storytelling and quests with a cascade of narrative outcomes, Valhalla's story is noticeably more linear, with few places to really exert your own decision-making and control. Each of its many map regions holds an arc with several main missions and perhaps a secondary objective, but no side-quests whatsoever. Indeed, in what feels like a regression even from Origins, you'll simply run across fleeting world events, which amount to quick interactions with NPCs. Valhalla's winnowed quest structure feels like a decision made to provide a more focused tale - one that is never left to wander all over the Mediterranean, but that instead directs you to specific parts of England, one at a time, before reporting back to your settlement for a debrief. Each region you visit feels like a feature-length episode of a good TV show, with guest stars that often recur further down the line. The focused plot twists and heartbreaks in Valhalla's tale often hit emotional highs Odyssey sometimes struggled with amongst the sheer weight of storytelling spread all over its world, while Eivor's journeys further afield to Vinland, Asgard and Jotunheim are well integrated into direction of the main narrative rather than being left for players who still want more after the main quest is done. Still, it's a disappointment that the flourishing RPG-side of Assassin's Creed has been impacted, that Valhalla does not hold much room for meaningful choices, and that the few dialogue options on offer give little more than quickly-forgotten flavour. Eivor is a great and memorable heroine, but one I rarely felt I was forging my own version of, as I had with Odyssey's Kassandra.One antidote to the lack of side-quests is the impact of your settlement, and the time you'll spend getting to know its growing community. For those who remember Assassin's Creed 3's frontier village, the vibe is very similar - and, ultimately it feels closer to that than the kind of RPG hub where everyone has something new to say every time you visit. Still, every so often, a new quest will pop up involving one of your villagers, and typically these slice of life stories offer an enjoyable palate cleanser from the drama of the main campaign. You'll go hunting or sightseeing, sometimes to be rewarded with an unexpected new ability or item as a result, or other times just to get closer to a character who might otherwise be a vendor. Some of these characters can be romanced (there are a few options for flings outside the village too), and some can become a permanent partner for Eivor. It's a step up from the fleeting romance options introduced in Odyssey, but it still feels mechanical.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ad1d833-b134-4b66-9023-190211be3c1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ad1d833-b134-4b66-9023-190211be3c1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "99ffd3ef-a43c-4648-a2c6-de3bdcbce3c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "15571945ce6893c11fdb20684e45fdddae7735f02ed861c295e9fe27c8edf5d4"}, "3": {"node_id": "bf716cb5-e451-4349-ad0c-db1ad152f053", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33c88ca867b9be14aaf8b76578001bb203bf4a2b97a8c295db96f0ff6312ef20"}}, "hash": "e6f47cfd0407efa380941cb1f4519569a3a24475c05e46ecedf110250edf6c69", "text": "And while one particular romance option does impact the game's story - one of the few times I felt able to see something of my own version of Eivor play out - this thread still felt abrupt.Otherwise, your settlement features a bustling population you can mostly ignore, unless you need their services or access to one of the game's various systems they control. There's a blacksmith who can upgrade gear quality, boat workers who can trick out your longship, or hunters who reward you for slaughtering wildlife. Assassin's Creed Origins fans will recognise a familiar face once again providing quests to let you grind out items from the game's paid cosmetic packs. Other characters here have even less to do - the initially interesting Hidden One named Hytham, for example, or Roman fanatic Octavian, both essentially act as places to dump collectables you find when exploring the open world. I love having a settlement with so many familiar faces in it, I just wish there was more for them to do.Beyond the settlement's walls, England awaits. Valhalla's version is the ultimate Saxon pastoral fantasy, one of roundhouse huts and crumbling Roman ruins set amongst flowering meadows, dry stone walls, forests, fens, and fields. Every surface feels embellished, from the fronds of moss on the stones Eivor climbs, to the cave systems regularly hidden behind towering waterfalls. It is often astonishingly pretty, particularly around golden hour, or as the evening mist sets in, moonlight filtering through trees. I could write pages about how this game replicates the feeling of the English countryside, the flourishes that can be found as you explore, the dirt which gets caked onto Eivor's boots as she stomps through the fields, or the snow kicked onto her clothes while adventuring in colder climes. (And, as a local, the sight of an early Norwich, the inclusion of Seahenge, the legendary Black Shuck and the ability to see seals on the north Norfolk coast felt like East Anglian fan service.) Between England, Norway, Vinland, Asgard and Jotunheim, Eivor has an astonishing breadth of landscapes to explore, and while size comparisons are always crude, Valhalla's world is one which altogether feels equal to Odyssey's scope. More importantly, perhaps, it is spread out in a way that feels more manageable, more varied, and more enticing. Few story arcs passed by without me getting majorly distracted by several different things along the way, and while location types are not always unique, each generally features a clever bit of puzzling to find hidden loot, or an interesting layout of enemies upon which to test my battle skills. Early chapters in Valhalla's narrative skew towards a strong Viking flavour - raiding with your longship, castle assaults and the like - that are later balanced to some degree by the game's cities: dense areas that encourage you to spend several hours at a time scurrying around rooftops well away from your Viking crew and longboat. These are, of course, relatively small when compared to the floor space of the city-set games of the past. Still, they will make early Assassin's Creed fans feel very much at home in terms of the gameplay on offer: investigation-style activities, treasure hunts, rooftop assassinations, and even the series' first tailing mission in what feels like years. Vinland, meanwhile, offers the traditional 'let's put the main character somewhere completely different with none of their usual gear' section, while not walling Eivor in there for however long it takes you to complete its arc. Fans of Assassin's Creed 3 are the ones being treated here, with treetop parkour and long sections voiced entirely in Native American language. (Oh, and eight years later, the kayaks which got cut from that game are finally now usable.)Valhalla slowly builds up Eivor's abilities, though I never got to the point where I felt as powered up as Kassandra in Odyssey (even if the lore nerd in me acknowledges Kassandra was able to wield an essentially-magical artefact to do so). Still, combat feels refined, far more bloody, and meatier overall now with three gauges to keep an eye on (health, stamina for things like dodging, and your special ability bar). Valhalla offers a sprawling skill web, nodes of which you'll unlock at regular XP milestones, in order to access numerous passive abilities.

I liked combining this with the thrown axe double assassinate skill to get two super-assassinations at a time. There's also an option buried within Valhalla's options menu to switch on automatic one-shot assassinations - a fan-requested feature, interestingly included here despite its description warning players this is not how Ubisoft intends the game to be played. There are several other changes from Odyssey that initially take some adjustment. Your raven drone has been significantly nerfed from the eagles of the past, and no longer lets you automatically tag items or enemies you're after (you can manually tag three, but in an enemy-dense area this is not a lot of help). It's a frustrating change that impacts the ease at which you can stealth through larger combat zones, and it  results in more detections by enemies you otherwise have to keep pinging using your fiddly R3 button Odin Sight. Fall damage is back, negatable up to a certain extent but no longer fully escapable. Gear is now permanent but upgradable - a change I found left me less likely to swap between items after pumping resources into a build that worked well enough. And while it's nice to be able to take the weapons you began with to the story's finale, finding base level items in the open world even in the late game can often be underwhelming. While we're talking annoyances, we should also talk about bugs. For reference, I'm playing Valhalla on a retail Xbox Series X, and with the launch day build of the game available when the game releases tomorrow. At the time of writing, the one major bugbear I have is with its screen-tearing, which usually occurs in mocapped sequences when there are multiple characters moving around on screen, though sometimes also appears in busy areas of general gameplay such as assaults within the interior of a castle. I've spoken to others with similar experiences and know Ubisoft is aware of the problem, though the suggestion I got for a fix did not solve the issue. In the grand scheme of things, these are minor annoyances in a vast experience, and while there changes from Odyssey to adjust to, I also know some of these will result in a mechanically more traditional entry that may be welcomed by some. Indeed, as both Quebec and Montreal teams continue to alternate on releasing Assassin's Creed games, it is perhaps only natural the two build on each other's accomplishments while keeping their own styles - and there is so much to enjoy in Valhalla, a game that simultaneously feels a worthy wrap-up for the series' recent forays into ancient history, a strong first entry for next-gen consoles this year, and one which lays important groundwork for the franchise's future.It's this future I'm thinking of as I reflect on the series' recent past, and on a painful year for those affected by a culture of problems within Ubisoft. Valhalla is the work of many hundreds of people - not just its former creative director who, as far as I can tell, no longer holds a place in Valhalla's credits. It is the work of many of the same people who created Origins, and who wanted Aya to have a more prominent role there, not just the studio heads and editorial team who thought otherwise. And it is the work of developers who recently reached out to the ACSisterhood fan initiative, to include their community within the final game.\r\nJust over two years ago, I reviewed Assassin's Creed Odyssey and recommended it thoroughly, while still looking forward to polishing off its remaining parts. Two years on, I feel like I'm at a similar point with Valhalla. Since then, the already enormous Odyssey has grown bigger (I still play it every week), and the same will also be true of Valhalla. The series' first free seasonal content will arrive before Christmas, bringing new abilities, missions and yuletide items to your Viking settlement. Similar updates will follow through every season of 2021, separate from the game's upcoming paid-for Ireland and Paris expansions, and the now traditional Discovery Tour mode to follow. Before all of that though, Valhalla already feels complete. It is a Viking saga which does at times struggle a little in reaching its destiny, and in its efforts to evolve the series has made some sacrifices to tell a stronger overall story. But it wins through, in the end quite easily, as it continues the Assassin's Creed saga for a new generation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51833cbd-56bb-4f71-b890-c443fc0e2c6d": {"__data__": {"id_": "51833cbd-56bb-4f71-b890-c443fc0e2c6d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf716cb5-e451-4349-ad0c-db1ad152f053", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33c88ca867b9be14aaf8b76578001bb203bf4a2b97a8c295db96f0ff6312ef20"}, "3": {"node_id": "191b00bf-ee0d-4a1f-9e7d-367d19d26c0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695bd86221347ee09e1b64f4c6859f5543657612773e94a330a60b4dfb90d928"}}, "hash": "d68a52a0e8f3c5a0092b9a19f748eef226b83b2accbd246ceb08f084656c7ab1", "text": "From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nTom Phillips\n\n          Editor-in-Chief\n        Tom is Eurogamer's Editor-in-Chief.

An enormous Viking RPG\nExpect to pay $60\nDeveloper Ubisoft\nPublisher:Ubisoft\nReviewed on i7 8700, RTX 2070, 16GB RAM\nMultiplayer? No\nOut November 10\nLink assassinscreed.comAssassin's Creed Valhalla is my favorite Assassin's Creed, which is saying something considering it's a series that spans 23 games. It builds on the already excellent RPG foundations laid by Origins and Odyssey, but with meaningful improvements that iron out many of the frustrations I had with both games. Case in point: Not once during the 60-hour story was I told to stop and level up a bunch before I could take on the next quest. That also means Ubisoft isn't selling optional experience boosts, either. Thank god.What really stands out to me, though, is how much better Valhalla is at telling an engaging story that twists and turns according to my decisions. In Odyssey, my choices sometimes felt arbitrary or confusing, but Valhalla does a great job of introducing characters, concepts, and themes, and then forcing me to decide how Eivor, the main character, relates to them. When one of my beloved own clansmen betrayed me and tried to take my life, I had no choice but to kill them in self defense. But I agonized for almost a full minute over whether to let them grasp their axe with their dying breath or kick it away, denying them entrance into Valhalla. I had come to love this character and their betrayal was upsetting, but does that justify denying them an eternity in heaven?What really impresses me, though, is how consistently great the story is throughout the entire adventure.Set during the Viking Invasion of England, the story follows Eivor and her adoptive brother Sigurd, two fierce Norse warriors chasing glory. Like Odyssey, Eivor can be played as either a man or a woman, but what's great is you can now switch between them freely to test which one suits you instead of being locked into that choice from the outset. Whichever Eivor you play as, the story unfolds in mostly the same way. Sigurd was supposed to be made a local king, but the unification of Norway under King Harald leaves him two choices: Bend the knee or leave. Unwilling to give up his dream of ruling, Sigurd convinces Eivor and much of his clan to abandon Norway and sail to England so they can violently carve out a new future.The anchor of this story is my settlement, called Ravensthorpe, which expands slowly over time as I gather new resources and construct new buildings. Like Dutch's camp in Red Dead Redemption 2, the settlement is my home base that I return to frequently in between quests. New buildings unlock new upgrades, like a forge so I can enhance my equipment or a brewery so I can host feasts that give me a temporary buff to my stats. As the settlement expands, it draws new characters, sidequests, and even the opportunity for romance. When huntress Petra asked me to help her look for her missing brother, for example, we ended up accidentally tripping on some magic mushrooms we found and chasing forest creatures instead. Like any good trip, we bonded and became lovers a few dates later.Even though many of the characters aren't as fully realized and vivid as in Red Dead Redemption 2, I love how Valhalla's settlement encourages me to get to know my clan. Instead of completing side quests for random strangers I find while exploring, like in Odyssey, I'm helping my blacksmith find a wife, or my museum curator settle a feud. Each one is a narrative thread that, woven together, tells the collective story of the Raven clan.Most of the story is concerned with what's happening outside the borders of my settlement, however. In order to cement a permanent place in England, Eivor and Sigurd have to negotiate alliances with the various Viking tribes (and the occasional Saxon king). This is all centered around an Alliance Map, where I choose which region I want to venture to, participating in a somewhat self-enclosed series of quests to win the favor of whichever faction happens to be there.At first this structure seemed too templated and isolated, but once the story gets going characters from one region will pop up in the story of another, giving a nice sense of continuity between these otherwise independent chapters. What really impresses me, though, is how consistently great the story is throughout the entire adventure, even as it takes astounding detours to places far beyond England and Norway.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f40ab91b-8d85-4043-b431-d571fc370bf9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f40ab91b-8d85-4043-b431-d571fc370bf9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "191b00bf-ee0d-4a1f-9e7d-367d19d26c0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "695bd86221347ee09e1b64f4c6859f5543657612773e94a330a60b4dfb90d928"}, "3": {"node_id": "0398a88c-2eb7-4fbc-be37-62afc623c6fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd8528e86eaf51f51c55e9627ea2e07a5f6932a5e7dbede8fb8aa6ca9b8c1075"}}, "hash": "97fc850dfdd4656d07c7080b5774573dd823f7f0d8a9c5b3a53d23f8340c983d", "text": "That's something I can't really say for any other Assassin's Creed games, including Odyssey.It takes a while before it all starts to come together, but Ubisoft does a great job juxtaposing my relationships with Sigurd and the rest of the Raven clan with the much more epic sagas as I wage war on Picts with the legendary Halfdan Ragnarsson, establish puppet kings with Ivar the Boneless, or trade veiled threats with Aelfred, King of Wessex. All the while, dialogue choices poke and prod the rigidity of Norse culture and traditions with surprising nuance. It's hard to explain without spoiling specific moments, but Valhalla has some wickedly knotted moral conundrums. There were a dozen or more times I stared at dialogue choices, completely stumped over which option was right.There are still some moments where Valhalla feels like a bad Game of Thrones episode, though. Entire armies show up undetected at a moment's notice, and characters will inexplicably change sides in a conflict just to reveal they're actually a part of the Templar order\u2014the overarching villains of the Assassin's Creed mythos.\u00a0These cutscenes are relatively few and far between, and ultimately this is a game about two warring cults reliving historical simulations to uncover mythological artifacts in the modern day\u2014a bit of cheese is expected. But, and I can't believe I'm about to say this, Valhalla even makes Assassin's Creed's sloppy overarching meta-narrative interesting again. Without spoiling anything, the final two hours are a whirlwind of revelations with implications that stretch all the way back to the first game. God help me, I actually want to see what happens next.Raiding feels like a shallow feature clumsily stitched onto the rest of the game.I love that the Norwegian invaders are portrayed as so much more than vicious barbarians, but it also ignores more troubling aspects of that era of history completely. It feels like a wayward extension of Ubisoft's feeble reluctance to admit its games have political messages.Take raiding, for example. To gather resources to expand my settlement, I have to pillage Christian monasteries dotted along the various riverways of England's different kingdoms. The first few times I did this, it was exhilarating: My soldiers stormed the town, hurling torches onto thatched-roof cottages, slaughtering the guards, breaking windows, shattering pots and crates, and helping me kick down doors to get at more valuable loot. But god help you if you kill an unarmed clergyman, even by accident. Kill too many and it's game over. Burning their entire lives to the ground, however, is totally OK.\u00a0I'm not saying Valhalla should gleefully reward you for butchering Christians, but including a hard rule against it feels like Ubisoft intervening just to wag a finger in my face. It's even stranger when I start a quest with a Saxon lord who completely ignores the fact that I pillaged every church in his lands on the way to meet him. It makes raiding feel like a shallow feature clumsily stitched onto the rest of the game rather than something incorporated into and accounted for by the story. Ubisoft could've invented a narrative reason why Eivor doesn't kill innocents or just made priests really good at dodging thrown axes when they're fleeing for the hills. Instead I'm given a warning message that completely pulls me out of the moment.\u00a0I have a similar problem with Valhalla's Assaults\u2014the big set piece castle sieges that typically act as the climax of a given regional questline. I'd never expect Ubisoft to go to the pains of simulating a full battle from start to finish, but the illusion of participating in one is paper thin. I'll use a battering ram to smash down the castle gate only to find my own soldiers are inexplicably already inside the castle and locked in never-ending mock combat with enemy soldiers. There's no sense of a battle having an ebb and flow, and so long as I complete my objectives the fight will progress in my favor.Both of these issues would be a lot more frustrating if combat weren't so much fun. The system is similar to Odyssey's in a lot of ways, but much more satisfying. For example, I can now dual-wield any two weapons, changing my combat style while also giving me access to special moves unique to my offhand weapon. Playing on a harder difficulty, I immediately favored the traditional axe and shield for the extra defense. But then I unlocked an ability on Valhalla's skill tree that let me dual-wield two-handed weapons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0398a88c-2eb7-4fbc-be37-62afc623c6fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "0398a88c-2eb7-4fbc-be37-62afc623c6fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "f40ab91b-8d85-4043-b431-d571fc370bf9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "97fc850dfdd4656d07c7080b5774573dd823f7f0d8a9c5b3a53d23f8340c983d"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c9eda4f-a434-4b64-9ade-0fe42e60a04f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef3c5e54ee4d5dba697bb284c63776f75050fdb46a168c04b5347f9591840bf1"}}, "hash": "fd8528e86eaf51f51c55e9627ea2e07a5f6932a5e7dbede8fb8aa6ca9b8c1075", "text": "What a game changer.Instead of sporting a measly axe, I'm holding a two-handed battle axe in one hand and a massive spear in the other\u2014or I can hold two spears and be extra stabby, or two shields and be extra shieldy. It's so much fun discovering all of these combinations. And no matter what weapons I choose, I know I'm going to be both horrified and amazed at just how artfully Eivor can use them to separate people from their limbs.It's hard to overstate just how gnarly some of the finishing movies are. I've repeatedly knocked enemies down and then impaled them on their own spears, or chopped their hands off as they raised them to defend against the axe I was about to lodge in their skull. There's even one where Eivor sticks an axe in a guy's face and then punches his head off. It's exactly what you'd hope for in a game about Vikings.Of course, stealth is still an option, but it's quickly becoming the most antiquated part of Assassin's Creed\u2014if only because so little of it has changed. Valhalla brings back some cool features like being able to blend into crowds to avoid guards and creating distractions to draw them away, but I'm often frustrated by how shitty the AI continues to be. Guards are dumb, and you can easily lure them into bushes one after another to assassinate them, and when one does spot you it feels like every guard within five miles immediately knows where you are. These are the same problems I've had in every Assassin's Creed, sure, but they're still annoying. At least Valhalla is more willing to let me forgo stealth entirely in all but a few quests. Being a sneaky Viking doesn't feel appropriate, anyway.\u00a0On my i7 8700 and RTX 2070, I'm getting 60-70 fps using 1440p and high settings. There's occasional dips, but overall I'm impressed with Valhalla's performance. It's absolutely gorgeous, too.Like most Ubisoft games, though, this might not be your experience. Other members at PC Gamer had to really mess with options for a long time just to get stable performance, and Valhalla demands a beefy system if you hope to get remotely good framerates. Even with top-tier hardware, expect to spend some time messing with the different options and a few hiccups. If your CPU or GPU are a few generations old, you'll have to make some compromises.The combat isn't all just flash, though. There are 23 different human enemy types that each have their own distinct weapons and combat styles, which makes fights feel dynamic and often quite challenging. It's more varied than any other Assassin's Creed. Rogues will kick dirt in your eyes to blind you, while Ceorl's will swap weapons with dead allies, 'Berserkirs' will pelt you with thrown axes while they run you down. Knowing the attack patterns and timing of these enemies takes patience and skill.Fortunately, Eivor has more tools than just the weapons she wields. While exploring, special books can be found that unlock new abilities, like being able to set your weapon on fire or a harpoon you can use to yank enemies off cliffs. This, coupled with a skill tree that recalls Path of Exile\u2014hundreds of nodes that offer incremental stat boosts mixed with bigger ability unlocks\u2014makes customizing Eivor really fun.This all feeds back into the open world exploration, which remains largely untouched from Odyssey saved for a few improvements. The map is still littered with icons in typical Ubisoft fashion, but you can (and should) turn that all off in the options so that you can explore without signposts everywhere. Most of the stuff you'll find is new equipment and treasure you can take back home or use for upgrades, but I also found hidden caves with challenging puzzles, secret boss battles, and weird little one-off quests that are often bizarre and sometimes hilarious. One time I happened upon a Viking who didn't realize he had an axe lodged in his skull. He asked me what he should do so I offered to remove it, and he died instantly. That was it. Quest completed, I guess?Valhalla succeeds on so many levels that it's easy to forgive the times when it doesn't.These activities all reward you with skill points you can spend in the skill tree. But, like I said earlier, Valhalla doesn't use this as a way to gate your progress through the story. Different regions still have power levels you have to match if you hope to survive the enemies there, so you can't go anywhere you want right away.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c9eda4f-a434-4b64-9ade-0fe42e60a04f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c9eda4f-a434-4b64-9ade-0fe42e60a04f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0398a88c-2eb7-4fbc-be37-62afc623c6fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd8528e86eaf51f51c55e9627ea2e07a5f6932a5e7dbede8fb8aa6ca9b8c1075"}, "3": {"node_id": "577fb0e1-1d4b-4008-8458-ca3bda012463", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b8dec818c57f3c49feae5c50f908b0f78a5d41a35075c3a87bc1b8fb6dd9293"}}, "hash": "ef3c5e54ee4d5dba697bb284c63776f75050fdb46a168c04b5347f9591840bf1", "text": "But aside from doing a little exploring, I mostly blitzed through the story without ever feeling forced to go off and do something else to level up.These little improvements go a long way in making Valhalla more inviting and fun than Odyssey.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, Ubisoft\u2019s open world Viking adventure is one of the biggest multiformat releases this Christmas but how does it compare to previous entries?Assassin\u2019s Creed is a franchise that\u2019s been around long enough that it\u2019s starting to run out of historical eras in which to set its almost annual instalments. Valhalla returns to the series\u2019 temporal roots with a trip back to the Dark Ages, this time in ninth century Norway and England rather than the original\u2019s Jerusalem, although this outing also brings along a number of the game\u2019s more recent innovations to help keep you busy.Starting in a snow-covered but jolly Viking village, the bonhomie is short-lived, as the settlement gets raided, your character\u2019s parents and their friends slaughtered, and your protagonist taken in by a friendly neighbouring king. Not shying away from the fact that Vikings made slaves of their captured enemies, it still tries to portray them as an honourable people despite their love of a good pillage.Your first choice is whether the game\u2019s protagonist Eivor is male, female, or if you want to leave it up to the Animus (the device that lets modern humans play through large stretches of historical people\u2019s lives) to switch Eivor\u2019s sex at critical moments in the story. We played as a female Eivor, but that\u2019s entirely optional and seems to make only cosmetic differences to the game itself.Apart from that complication, Valhalla is in almost all ways Assassin\u2019s Creed business as usual. On a sprawling map you\u2019ll once again need to climb high points to \u2018synchronise\u2019 new chunks of the landscape, revealing monasteries and villages to raid, treasures to discover, and what the game calls \u2018world events\u2019.Those aren\u2019t quite side quests so much as minor incidents built around often pretty offbeat characters and their problems. The franchise as a whole tends towards relentless poker face, and world events are really the only place it manages to display a sense of humour, as you chat to the various weirdos who either need help with something or weakly try to rob you, letting you lay waste to their unfortunate bandit buddies.In recent Assassin\u2019s Creed games you had access to an eagle that was effectively the drone in Ghost Recon, letting you scout the landscape, highlight bad guys, and spot loot pick-ups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "577fb0e1-1d4b-4008-8458-ca3bda012463": {"__data__": {"id_": "577fb0e1-1d4b-4008-8458-ca3bda012463", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c9eda4f-a434-4b64-9ade-0fe42e60a04f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef3c5e54ee4d5dba697bb284c63776f75050fdb46a168c04b5347f9591840bf1"}, "3": {"node_id": "843b2c44-17b6-4bdb-9f05-6bad09848518", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "564b4f4d9de3c7bf1faff52a542623c8e6e60ea4deec32e02063289b25bc9c52"}}, "hash": "9b8dec818c57f3c49feae5c50f908b0f78a5d41a35075c3a87bc1b8fb6dd9293", "text": "This time around you have a raven, and it no longer auto-targets enemies. For that you\u2019ll need to get in close and use your Odin Sight, the refreshed name for Eagle Vision from the earlier games.The net effect is that you can no longer conveniently scope everything out from a distance, before sneaking forwards and mopping up enemies with your bow. You now need to plunge into the thick of things to find and eliminate guards and spot treasures, some of which can be extremely well hidden. This often demands some environmental problem solving, smashing crates to slither through gaps or dropping heavy boxes on weakened boards to open underground tunnels.Fighting has now changed significantly. Battles have a weightier feel, and no longer are you encouraged to be stealth-only. Raids, a major facet of being a Viking, favour all-out attacks where you charge in bellowing, rather than creeping in using your bow and hidden blade. That means mixing parries, dodges, and shield-based defence with light and heavy attacks to overcome often quite large groups of enemies. It\u2019s not quite the Souls-Bjorn it would like to be, but it\u2019s a more interesting system than recent games.That\u2019s not to say stealth doesn\u2019t also play a part though. Taking down outposts solo is still a mainly quiet affair, ducking into shrubbery to avoid detection, picking off foes when nobody else is looking, and whistling quietly to attract single guards so you take them down without causing an alert. Valhalla also sees the return of social blending from the early Assassin\u2019s Creeds, where instead of out-and-out hiding, you can pull up your hood and sit on a bench or shuffle along with the locals.This being a very long time ago, the Templars are still prototypical, calling themselves The Order of the Ancients. Their chiefs and the zealots that make up their rank and file become your targets, in a campaign to rid England of their vile influence. Initially they\u2019re impossibly tough, with armour and attacks that so massively outclass anything you\u2019re capable of that there\u2019s no point even trying, but soon enough you\u2019ll unlock sufficient upgrades to be able to turn the tables.Skill points arrive in pairs, letting you open up nodes on a Final Fantasy X-style skill tree, that remains invisible until you unlock neighbouring branches. Although initially that feels unnecessarily confusing you soon realise that the order in which you unlock stuff doesn\u2019t really matter that much. Yes, you can favour attacks over stealth if that\u2019s the way your Eivor likes to do business, but eventually you\u2019ll end up with similar bonuses anyway as you gain access to more and more of the tree.Separate from that are abilities, which you acquire through reading special books. Each has a single upgrade level unlocked by finding a duplicate book, and you\u2019ll often have to do a good bit of puzzling and exploration to locate them in their underground cellars, the entrances to which are barred, forcing you to find alternative routes underground. It\u2019s an interesting way of adding challenge without simply throwing in legions of extra enemies.Along with crowd blending, Valhalla also sees the welcome return of the assassin\u2019s hidden wrist blade, although this time it\u2019s upgradeable and often isn\u2019t enough to kill tougher enemies in a single strike. For basic cannon fodder it\u2019s more than enough however and remains a satisfying and silent way of dispatching guards without anyone being any the wiser.Beyond the moment-to-moment jobs of raids, assassinations, and treasure hunting, there\u2019s an extensive meta game in which you use pilfered supplies to build and upgrade your English settlement. That gives you access to better weapons, a more pimped-out longboat, and Jomsvikings, the Assassin\u2019s Creed equivalent of Dragon\u2019s Dogma pawns \u2013 computer-controlled allies that you hire out to other players online.You\u2019ll also need to build influence with local clans, helping them out by razing their enemies, returning recently captured strongholds to them, and generally being a good neighbour. It helps add a little shape to what might otherwise feel like a somewhat formless enterprise, which despite its variety, still amounts to little more than a bunch of disparate tasks.Whether all this makes you salivate with anticipation or feel tired inside is largely a question of where you stand on the question of Ubisoft open world games. Ghost Recon, Far Cry, Watch Dogs, and Assassin\u2019s Creed now share such obviously similar DNA that if you like one, the chances are you\u2019ll enjoy the others \u2013 but the opposite is also true.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "843b2c44-17b6-4bdb-9f05-6bad09848518": {"__data__": {"id_": "843b2c44-17b6-4bdb-9f05-6bad09848518", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "577fb0e1-1d4b-4008-8458-ca3bda012463", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b8dec818c57f3c49feae5c50f908b0f78a5d41a35075c3a87bc1b8fb6dd9293"}, "3": {"node_id": "24c9fb98-a11a-4138-beca-e6c4c35862ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "49e3ac26dfe0fcc5e43d09b9ceea57d44d258578b9eb5768c7f86b832bbf8bff"}}, "hash": "564b4f4d9de3c7bf1faff52a542623c8e6e60ea4deec32e02063289b25bc9c52", "text": "Anyone sick and tired of mildly repetitive, sprawling open worlds will find every single thing they hate in Valhalla.Still, if you\u2019ve got a hundred hours to kill, and enjoy spending time wheedling your way through a recalcitrant underground entrance, or toying with distractions like tactical dice game, Orlog; competitive drinking from animal horns; or Flyting, the historically accurate insult-based viking rap battles, then Assassin\u2019s Creed is a game of rare size and scope.The game offers an ultra-stylised take on its historical settings, the blood red sunsets and god rays of Norway, and the gold-infused greenery of an England that really never was, but as in feature films, where everything\u2019s turned up to 11 for extra visual impact, it really works, with almost every scene looking like a Turner painting.

Speech that pauses or stutters, controller vibration that keep going on uncontrollably during cut scenes, or a civilian walking on the spot atop a guard tower. Even the load screens aren\u2019t safe, with Eivor occasionally appearing with slanting grey bars connecting her with the ground. None completely ruins the game, but they do undermine the atmosphere.So for better and for worse, Valhalla is every inch an Assassin\u2019s Creed game. It\u2019s huge, varied and mildly disjointed, but also rich, satisfying, and frequently great fun. The FromSoftware inspired battles are a distinct improvement and Valhalla has got some decent mini-games, if that\u2019s your cup of tea, but it also suffers from manifold glitches at launch. With a bit of luck they\u2019ll be patched up in due course, but as it stands this is a game that falls a few metres short of true brilliance.In Short: A vast and multi-faceted trip through a stylised Viking life, with a new fighting system, manifold mini-games and diversions, and untold glitches.

It looks beautiful throughout and it\u2019ll keep you out of trouble for weeks.Cons: Many bugs. The open world is large and relatively empty, a problem exacerbated if you turn down the HUD settings. Conversational choices rarely seem important and side missions feel flyweight and inconsequential.Score: 7/10Formats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and StadiaPrice: \u00a359.99Publisher: UbisoftDeveloper: Ubisoft MontrealRelease Date: 10th November 2020 (19/11 on PS5)Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : Far Cry 6 release date is February 2021, Watch Dogs Legion is October, and Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is November\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Assassin\u2019s Creed and Splinter Cell director resigns after sexual misconduct allegations\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Assassin\u2019s Creed Ragnarok leaked on multiple shop websites\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.ukFor more stories like this, check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGamesRadar+, When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

A very knowing one, full of complaints from Viking Eivor at their target\u2019s speed, but a tailing mission nonetheless. But why start here in a review when there is a sprawling Mercia to celebrate with a raised horn of mead?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24c9fb98-a11a-4138-beca-e6c4c35862ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "24c9fb98-a11a-4138-beca-e6c4c35862ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "843b2c44-17b6-4bdb-9f05-6bad09848518", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "564b4f4d9de3c7bf1faff52a542623c8e6e60ea4deec32e02063289b25bc9c52"}, "3": {"node_id": "7295e2b4-2ace-4b98-83a2-ead254386ca4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1a3ebae69afd532c114a2193a8fe665594e79e214828ef20e6cdb7d7466ea55"}}, "hash": "49e3ac26dfe0fcc5e43d09b9ceea57d44d258578b9eb5768c7f86b832bbf8bff", "text": "A frankly ludicrously beautiful world of rolling hills, mystical snowy castle ruins, and the eventual ability to dual wield a longsword and a gleaming axe bigger than most of the inhabitants of your settlement. Oh, and the fact that you can ride a giant wolf instead of a horse, who\u2019ll come lolloping into view at the press of a button and growl with a satisfying low rumble not unlike a truck engine... \u00a0\u00a0It's because that tailing mission is important though, vital even. Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s only that one but it\u2019s important to address straight away that Valhalla has managed to perfectly rekindle the fires of the traditional Assassin\u2019s Creed experience. One where hay is key and endless ropes stretch helpfully across villain-filled streets. And yes, it\u2019s lit these embers with a torch and a roar. #JustPillagingThings?\u00a0Release date: November 10, 2020\nPlatform(s): PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series X, PC\nDeveloper/Publisher: UbisoftIf there have been any complaints about the sprawling RPG-osity of both Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Odyssey, it\u2019s that the AC bloodline has been watered down, sacrificed on the altar of narrative decision making and endless loot. Assassin's Creed Valhalla effortlessly brings the two concepts back together, marrying the art of the assassination (complete with a gratifying gory \u2018hidden blade vision\u2019 addition) with grand castle sieges with volleys of arrows, shooting down drawbridges with a satisfying thunk, and the unmistakeable glooping of boiling oil.\u00a0A Hidden Ones Bureau is one of your earliest constructions in your settlement. As ironic as an Assassins symbol hanging outside a building on a shop sign is, this is a world where you can go contract killing and finding clues with your hood up, but also arrive at monasteries with the echoing war bellow of your horn, readying your axes for some serious, not to mention exhilarating, beheading. But how does it manage to do this? Put simply, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is huge. With the biggest campaign of an Assassin\u2019s Creed game so far - I clocked in at 63 hours to take over the war room\u2019s alliance map and see the finale - this is a saga worthy of the poet Eivor and mead-drenched tales around the campfire for the centuries to come.To remain entirely spoiler free, I\u2019ll just say that Eivor\u2019s Raven Clan arrives in 9th Century England, settles down in a peaceful wooded area, and decides to make alliances across the tumultuous Mercia - which feels a lot like arriving in a tantalising Viking theme park. Taking over one unique area at a time feels like a natural way to progress through the story, forging friends and enemies, and building an understanding of the power struggles that keep Mercia so divided. The hunt for peace really isn\u2019t so peaceful, even if you do occasionally decide to stay your blade.\u00a0Each region has its own distinct geography, spanning from the picturesque barren shores of Cent to the pleasant pagan Hobbity greenery of Glowcesterscire. Every journey in Valhalla feels incredible, whether you\u2019re letting your longship do the hard work and taking in the panoramic view option, or hoofing it over the countryside with Jesper Kyd and cos swelling atmospheric score in your ears. The cities too, especially the bustling and tightly-packed Roman Lunden, make for perfect reminders of AC cities of yore. These are worlds of verticality and pillars with nods to AC Brotherhood and more than a hint of air assassination. Which, brilliantly, are possible even with high-level enemies.Unlock a skill in the sprawling skill tree called Advanced Assassination and a mini-game will pop up every time you press the assassinate button, giving you a chance to get a moving marker in a zone to finish the deal. It\u2019s a perfect way to balance old and new, meaning boss battles can be dodged entirely if you play your blade right but there\u2019s no reason to worry if you just want to embed axes in limbs. But more on that in a bit.\u00a0Known as \u2018arcs\u2019, each region\u2019s story comes with the decision making that Odyssey defined, and your actions can have serious consequences. Accuse the wrong Saxon of treachery or install the wrong Ealdorman and your poor decision making will come back to haunt you or y\u2019know, stab someone in front of you. On the whole, this is satisfying with some pleasantly unexpected twists. The brilliant Eivor\u2019s word is law and while some decisions seem clear cut, others are much more morally murky.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7295e2b4-2ace-4b98-83a2-ead254386ca4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7295e2b4-2ace-4b98-83a2-ead254386ca4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "24c9fb98-a11a-4138-beca-e6c4c35862ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "49e3ac26dfe0fcc5e43d09b9ceea57d44d258578b9eb5768c7f86b832bbf8bff"}, "3": {"node_id": "e9cc33e2-5e8c-4bf0-ad32-7fbfd349e9e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8ec75a34581b4dbddb877c4c29afd5fb8b145bc97b616f0ed17c621234d9c97"}}, "hash": "d1a3ebae69afd532c114a2193a8fe665594e79e214828ef20e6cdb7d7466ea55", "text": "Quest wise though, sometimes it can be a little unclear where you\u2019ll find clues to back up your decisions and the default \u2018explorer\u2019 setting will mean constantly sending your raven skyward to check your next blue-highlighted section of the map. It\u2019s very occasional but feels like a misstep in an otherwise confident system full of all manner of ultra varied quests.No Creed game has been badly written but the Vikings setting has added a glorious insult game to the mix - tottering teat sucker anyone? - and Valhalla\u2019s script is hidden blade sharp. A warrior called Ivarr is a particularly entertaining standout character with no patience for peace and a comedian\u2019s tongue. The conversations with Odin too in some surprisingly dark cinematic Viking versions of the traditional \u2018white room\u2019 make for some troubling viewing. Combo the best written Creed with the addition of a charisma bar to unlock extra useful conversation options and things get interesting. Flyting opportunities, or Viking rap battles, can be found in most towns, demanding quick thinking and a penchant for rhyme. It\u2019s not easy at first but you\u2019ll get there in time\u2026 \u00a0But the heart of Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla isn\u2019t in its quick insults, it\u2019s your settlement and the relationships you form there. And yes, some of them are romantic but don\u2019t expect the sprawling romance options of Odyssey. Eivor\u2019s bedroom opportunities are less throwaway but equally fun. This collection of buildings starts out small but do enough raids and steal enough supplies and you can gradually build a full-on village. Repeated trips home to Randvi to report your progress and checking in everywhere makes for a compelling loop that\u2019s constantly rewarding.\u00a0Everything you collect can be brought back. Hidden One Hytham - yes, I see you, Ubisoft - takes the medallions of the Order of the Ancients members you bring down in exchange for powerful abilities, the hunter's hut is ready for your spoils, and there\u2019s even a museum for Roman Artefacts, meaning that even your most distracted of open-world activities will always give you a digital pat on the back.\u00a0The settlement evolves throughout the campaign too, letting the decisions you\u2019ve made influence its inhabitants. This means that even if there are really only two main endings, your settlement arrangement and longship crew can be very different from everyone else's. This is your community and it constantly feels like home to tell your stories of war. You can even make it your own aesthetically with sections for custom decorations. Why can\u2019t I get skull piles like that in IKEA, eh? One other major addition is Valka, your seer, who with the help of a potion can take you to two mythical universes. Incredibly, these are almost the size of Odyssey\u2019s DLC realms, beautiful and, in one case, packed with wish fulfilment, but a surprising addition in an already vast world. \u00a0The settlement too is the only place you can properly spec your weapons and gear, with blacksmith Gunnar upgrading each piece from superior to flawless and then up to mythical. It\u2019s here where Valhalla breaks the trend of the previous two Creeds where we were drowning in weaponry and gear, constantly dismantling for loot. Instead, specific armour pieces can be found in chests across the world, each with their own playstyle benefits. Each piece can be levelled up with iron and you\u2019ll be juggling rune slots to make the most of your combat style. It initially feels restrictive after the bounties of Origins and Odyssey but quickly feels like each piece suddenly has value and each upgrade is a decision to ponder. Do you spec everything up equally or build yourself a mega axe?\u00a0Speaking of axes, Valhalla\u2019s combat is significantly evolved. A dual wield system means Eivor can defend with a shield while raining down light and heavy attacks with an axe, but equally can pop another axe or hammer in their left hand. No-one is queuing up here to take a swing at you with Mercia\u2019s wide range of enemies all attacking at once, meaning knowing when to dodge and use up precious stamina or parry is vital. Whether you\u2019re facing bannermen or, my own personal nemesis, pikemen with spears, breaking down defences is constantly an enjoyably hefty challenge. The new ration system too means no refilling health, which can often go badly wrong if you aren\u2019t holding enough mushrooms and a band of enemies get nasty. It\u2019s a great balance of challenge and skill, making stealth a valuable and thankfully now viable option if you\u2019re not ready for the fight. \u00a0Remember though.

This is a Viking game. A history of warriors written in blood and as the saga goes on, every skill point upgrade and ability means the combat only goes from strength to strength. The skill tree is frankly intimidating, stretching enticingly off on unseen strands hidden under a fog of war. But level up and you\u2019ll reveal the ability to throw dropped weapons at foes, freeze time for a matter of seconds with a perfect dodge and roll over an enemy\u2019s back as they use their unparriable rune attack. Suddenly combat situations become perfect opportunities to combo your favourite skills, and it\u2019s a relief that you can fully respec your skill tree to make sure you\u2019re heading in the right direction. You\u2019ll know that when you\u2019re gleefully watching yet another animation of Eivor annihilating a heavy enemy with their own weapon. \u00a0Then though, there\u2019s everything else and the wonder of this world. Watching the sunrise over a standing stones puzzle, gleefully running your wolf alongside surprised deer in lush forests, building cairns at the top of a mountain pass, destroying cursed objects hidden in echoing caves deep below the ground. This is an Assassin\u2019s Creed game - are you even playing one if sometimes you stand on things instead of standing next to them? - but this is another glorious realm of possibility. An intimidatingly huge, atmospheric world of mysteries to solve but now with even more opportunities. There\u2019s also an intriguing central mystery with a frankly catnip lore ending for longtime AC fans and some WTF moments for everyone else. Stronger, bolder, and with a welcome reintroduction of the best bits of the older games, Valhalla is a roaring bloodied success with a true heart.\u00a0Reviewed on Xbox Series X where we experienced occasional screen tearing in busy and built-up areas.Louise Blain is a journalist and broadcaster specialising in gaming, technology, and entertainment.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nGame Informer, The Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise draws people in for many reasons. Over the years, it has provided stealth-focused infiltration, stylish encounters, high-seas adventures, and other elements \u2013\u00a0but not always in equal measure. Each installment hits different sweet spots for different players with varying degrees of success, but for the first time in the series, the balance feels perfect in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla. With its engaging combination of combat, open-world exploration, crafted story content, and settlement management, this Viking saga is an epic with a little something for everyone.Though Valhalla embodies a fascinating evolution for Assassin\u2019s Creed, you don\u2019t need any familiarity with the franchise to appreciate the tale of Eivor and the Raven Clan\u2019s incursion into Anglo-Saxon England. It\u2019s a massive story with small beginnings, following your Norse hero\u2019s attempts to forge alliances in hostile territory. Eivor\u2019s effort to create a new home brings together a variety of compelling loops that capture the adventurous Viking spirit; you can hunt legendary animals, track down new pieces of gear, or ride your longship down the riverways. Every time I left the clan\u2019s settlement of Ravensthorpe, I had to choose between multiple tempting paths.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f1dfbc6-e263-436b-8747-919ae04bf717": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f1dfbc6-e263-436b-8747-919ae04bf717", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9cc33e2-5e8c-4bf0-ad32-7fbfd349e9e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8ec75a34581b4dbddb877c4c29afd5fb8b145bc97b616f0ed17c621234d9c97"}, "3": {"node_id": "d8e48b4e-2810-4e97-aff8-ab6612a72093", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06d7da7e3b0abda476e3db06f917dad39925569eafd84efca36965e8fbe1b4e4"}}, "hash": "f19eeee938693c6250278e0a392035b2286a567d9c48a15d9993cee88308f4ab", "text": "This wealth of enticing options made me feel like a warrior at a feast with more delicious mead and meat than any one person could ever consume.\u00a0Valhalla\u2019s open-world content is deliberate and purposeful; apart from an overabundance of collectibles, nothing feels like unnecessary padding. Special world events called \u201cmysteries\u201d are the best example of this approach, replacing traditional sidequests. Mysteries aren\u2019t generic objectives like \u201ckill the bandits\u201d or \u201cloot the chest.\u201d Instead, they are authored scenarios that may present specific challenges or simply tell funny stories. For instance, I had to fight an old man who lamented his own undefeatable punching skill, count an ever-changing number of stones, and steal a piece of valuable art from a snob. Mysteries are short and contained to small areas, so they are more like fun diversions than logged quests you feel obligated to finish. But you should finish them anyway, because they are well-written and memorable, adding surprising flavor to the characters and the world.Brutal combat is a hallmark of the Viking legend, and it\u2019s an area where Valhalla builds upon the solid foundation of its predecessors. The sheer god-like power of your hero has been toned down compared to Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, but Eivor is still\u00a0a powerhouse . Fights feel like chaotic melee brawls rather than elegant dances of death; this can make some encounters feel too unfocused, but they also have a grounded sensation, with lots of clanging metal and splintering wood. Eivor can easily take on a crowd of foes, and the variety of different enemy types keeps you thinking just enough to keep the fray from devolving into button-mashing. The one-on-one boss fights are less consistent, sometimes straining the mechanics beyond what they can comfortably accomplish.\u00a0\u00a0A huge skill tree and an array of abilities give you plenty of freedom with how you build your character, with a good selection of passive and active bonuses that allow you to bend or break the usual rules of engagement. You find and purchase different weapons \u2013\u00a0swords, flails, spears, etc. \u2013 and equip them in each hand to find a combination you like. I spent a lot of time dual-wielding huge axes thanks to a skill I bought that lets you hold two-handed weapons in a single hand.\u00a0When I got overwhelmed, I fell back on my desperation tactic: using\u00a0sleep arrows to incapacitate enemies mid-fight, then closing\u00a0in for the assassination as they drifted off to sleep. It\u2019s not exactly the most honorable path to victory, but it is hilarious and effective.Eivor\u2019s exploits are all fun individually, but I\u2019m most impressed by how they all interact harmoniously. You get cool new gear and abilities through exploration, which makes you more formidable in combat. That means you can hunt more powerful members of the Order of the Ancients or raid villages in more dangerous regions for valuable supplies. Your accomplishments in the world feed back into your settlement, and managing Ravensthorpe is one of Valhalla\u2019s highlights. It is deeper than the base-building in previous installments, and the structures you build have major effects. Building a barracks allows you to create a Viking lieutenant you can share with your friends, while erecting a home for the seer lets Eivor delve into strange visions. Most new facilities come with some additional feature or quest, and I enjoyed seeing my humble collection of huts gradually grow into a thriving town.Ravensthorpe is where you consolidate your power, but much of your time is spent exploring the countryside. The stone castles and foggy swamps of 9th-Century England don\u2019t have the same magnificent splendor of Ancient Greece or Egypt, but they are still full of secrets and picturesque scenes. Alongside some time spent in\u00a0Norway (and other areas), this backdrop gives Valhalla its own colorful and earthy beauty.\u00a0The narrative is smartly broken up into location-based arcs as Eivor attempts to win friends in different regions. This provides the satisfaction of completing many separate stories, all while working toward your larger goal of prosperity for the Raven Clan. Some larger threads (which I won't ruin here) connect these tales, and I like how they are standalone sequences with their own payoffs. I never needed to grind in order to advance the plot, and I also appreciate how Eivor never gets bogged down with too much talk. While you can\u00a0choose some dialogue and make a few important choices, you aren\u2019t constantly navigating conversation trees, which keeps the story moving in each territory.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8e48b4e-2810-4e97-aff8-ab6612a72093": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8e48b4e-2810-4e97-aff8-ab6612a72093", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f1dfbc6-e263-436b-8747-919ae04bf717", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f19eeee938693c6250278e0a392035b2286a567d9c48a15d9993cee88308f4ab"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad1130eb-c25b-4198-b598-a6a778f49200", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1285e091e671fdccfc04190aed723786a69a0e310c53a9a5d38f26df42e0081a"}}, "hash": "06d7da7e3b0abda476e3db06f917dad39925569eafd84efca36965e8fbe1b4e4", "text": "However, don't expect to reach the saga's finale quickly; I played for over 70 hours, and that's without taking a completionist approach to exploration.The content and design of Valhalla are the best the series has seen in years, but the technical\u00a0frustrations are disappointingly familiar.

But on a practical level, none of them are severe enough to significantly dampen my enjoyment; the consequences usually aren't any worse than reloading an autosave and losing\u00a0a few\u00a0minutes of progress. I'd rather not deal with those issues, but the failures are light when weighed\u00a0against the heft of Valhalla's successes.\u00a0\u00a0I loved 2018\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey (especially after its post-release support), but that love was always tempered by a desire for improvements. I wished the content felt more carefully curated. I hated grinding to progress the story. I got sick of managing an inventory bloated with loot. Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla addresses all of those issues and more, creating a rewarding experience at every turn, whether you\u2019re pursuing the main narrative or hunting down treasure. I'm sure\u00a0Valhalla is not the perfect Assassin\u2019s Creed game for all players, but it is certainly my new favorite entry.My time playing Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla for review was spent exclusively on Xbox Series X. The graphics look great, and the faster loading times should be an immediately relief to anyone who has played an Assassin\u2019s Creed game in the last seven years. However, I also hit occasional framerate drops and persistent\u00a0screen tearing. These technical trade-offs prevent Valhalla from being a standard-bearer for the next generation of hardware, though aspects of its performance remain impressive.Other\u00a0Game Informer\u00a0editors have been playing the current-gen iteration on PS4. They are reporting longer loading times, as well as scattered performance issues in the game's\u00a0audio,\u00a0graphics, and animation. Considering all those factors,\u00a0playing Valhalla on next-gen\u00a0systems is the way to see it at its best, even if it doesn't run\u00a0flawlessly.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

The 12th major Assassin's Creed game shows a keen awareness of the history and gameplay innovations of the saga, and it feels like a love letter to the franchise as a whole. This makes the game a far more rewarding experience for longtime fans, though newcomers can still enjoy Valhalla's combat, emphasis on exploration, and mystery-driven narrative without years of time spent in the Animus.In Valhalla, you once again play as present-day protagonist Layla Hassan, who's still a bit shaken up after the unfortunate events at the end of Assassin's Creed Odyssey's second DLC, The Fate of Atlantis. Understandably ostracized from her old team, she's now partnered with fellow Assassins Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane. The trio find themselves facing the daunting task of needing to save the world, and their only clue as to how is a mysterious message of unknown origin that contains coordinates to a grave. With no other leads, Layla hops into the Animus machine with a DNA sample taken from the skeletal remains, allowing her to relive their life in the distant past. This time she'll be Eivor, a Viking who lived during the ninth century.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Assassin's Creed Valhalla ReviewThe Assassin's Creed games have traditionally struggled with the modern-day storyline that runs alongside the stories that take place in the past, and Valhalla is no different.

There's a clear and present danger, and a nice setup for the throughline of the game's campaign: the concept of fate.However, the same care is not extended to Valhalla's secondary main character Layla, whose arc in this game concludes in a way that doesn't feel earned. For a game all about fate and the consequences of trying to break free of it, Layla ends up feeling like a passenger more than the driver of the story. Given the lack of evolution in her character over her multiple appearances, her defining quality has become the bull-headed nature she exhibited in Origins and Odyssey. Thus, her characterization in this game seems all the more contradictory, leaving the modern-day storyline with a bit of an unsatisfying feeling. Thankfully, Layla isn't Assassin's Creed Valhalla's primary main character, and Eivor more than picks up the slack when it comes to story.Eivor is portrayed as female in the Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Song of Glory comic, which feels like a more natural choice for the character, so that's how I played them. However, you can choose to play as a male version instead, or have the Animus choose for you, which changes Eivor's gender at certain points throughout the campaign (and you can switch among all three options whenever you want). A Viking raider, Eivor is a leader of the Raven Clan alongside her adopted brother, Sigurd. At the start of Valhalla, Eivor has a vision that foretells she will meet a terrible fate. Before she can make proper sense of the more minute details of the vision, however, Sigurd decides to leave Norway for England, prompting her to follow. The two reestablish themselves but find their new home is now located at the centerpiece of several wars. Sigurd sets out to ally with each of England's four kingdoms (Wessex, Northumbria, East Anglia, and Mercia) in order to carve out a safe plot of land for the clan, leaving Eivor behind to oversee their growing settlement and only calling on her when he's in need of her strength or cunning intellect to put the final touches into securing a new alliance.Thus, Valhalla's story plays out over a series of self-contained narrative arcs--a first for Assassin's Creed. By talking to Sigurd's wife, Randvi, you can choose which of Sigurd's leads to pursue next, which kicks off a two-to-three-hour story. Upon completion, you return to Randvi to report on what transpired, invest any collected resources into the settlement, and then pick the next narrative thread.This structure works both for and against Valhalla's story. Once an arc is done, it's done--certain characters can come back in later arcs, but that very rarely happens. This opens up Valhalla to several different types of storytelling styles as well as different stories. It's not one large campaign of subsequent events but many events that loosely tie together--it's like Valhalla is divided into dozens of large-scale side quests. To the game's benefit, this means that if a specific narrative arc has characters or gameplay you don't necessarily enjoy--like, oh, I don't know, searching for some annoyingly hard-to-find environmental clues in order to figure out who amongst your group is a traitor--you know that once the arc is over, you're likely never going to have to engage with that pocket of England ever again. The story will soon move past that arc and then largely act like it never existed, giving you new characters to meet and mission structures to engage with. However, this works against the game too, as anything you like won't last either.The biggest detriment of the self-contained arcs is the somewhat shallow supporting cast. Because characters typically only stick around for a few hours, there isn't much time for development. And where there is any, it's rushed. I've seen a stalwart man who stubbornly maintains that the pagan Danes should be forced to believe in God change his tune after a night of drinking with Eivor and being kidnapped. Now, don't get me wrong, I can buy into someone changing who they are, but to see your entire set of morals do a 180 in a matter of hours defies belief. Rapid shifts in perspective and principles like this occur in other places throughout the campaign too, and they're usually just as unbelievable. Romances, especially, suffer for this. Unlike Odyssey's Kassandra/the other guy, Eivor can enter into long-term relationships with certain characters, regularly visiting them for dates and smooches.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5727b45d-3928-4a45-9483-7cdf6f418500": {"__data__": {"id_": "5727b45d-3928-4a45-9483-7cdf6f418500", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad1130eb-c25b-4198-b598-a6a778f49200", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1285e091e671fdccfc04190aed723786a69a0e310c53a9a5d38f26df42e0081a"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0e5737a-d8a8-4cf4-bade-b4c3f6595263", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "555df2a61700c41482d670011c8fd1f6eccacf7ffd397578be91138a6a0c8598"}}, "hash": "b9924b187277c00cee23e1a70fa12ede125c84ac99e724c5439d4271753b98d9", "text": "It's all very shallow, though, and, save for one (which I cannot talk about but holy crap the audacity of it makes it wonderful), they don't have any meaningful impact on Eivor's story.Eivor is the one who bucks the trend for Valhalla's paper-thin characters. We spend nearly 70 hours with her, so she does have a well-written character arc that's allowed to evolve at a believable pace. Eivor's primary motivation is to avoid her fate. Though her actual character is already established--she is a brash warrior and quick to anger, but also loyal to her clan, cunning, and a poet at heart--you get to push and prod at her thoughts and actions. Eivor wants to avoid being remembered as a shameful traitor, and you get to influence how far she's willing to go to ensure that outcome.The decisions you make determine how others--especially Sigurd--view Eivor, which can result in slight alterations to how certain arcs (and the campaign as a whole) end. They're small changes that avoid outright redefining the timeline of real human history, instead focusing on giving you the room to somewhat shape Eivor into your desired protagonist. For example, incorrectly deducing the identity of a traitor in one of the later arcs caused one of my allies to ultimately be shot, seemingly gravely so as I never heard from them again. Your decisions can impact gameplay too; for instance, after sparing one of the early game bosses, the man rewarded me for my kindness by telling me how to prevent Eivor's name from being added to the list of targets that the wandering Zealots hunt. Had I killed him, I would have never learned this information, and the group of some of Valhalla's most dangerous and powerful enemies would have hunted me throughout the rest campaign.Though Eivor is the only character that really benefits from it, this storytelling structure works out for Valhalla. With a main campaign that clocks in at 65 hours, dividing Valhalla into more digestible two-to-three-hour stories helps you get through the whole thing. There are clear stopping points in the campaign, which help pace the story so that it's not immediately jumping between too many high-key set pieces in short succession or going long stretches with nothing happening. Its pacing still isn't without its issues--Valhalla takes way too long to get to the more exciting and intriguing, nuanced arcs. I remember thinking, \"Oh, wow, this game is actually starting to get really freakin' good,\" and then seeing I was already 15 hours in. Once it hits its stride with memorable arcs and more things to do in the settlement, Valhalla starts to exhibit the kind of confidence you'd expect in the third go at the new open-world RPG style of Assassin's Creed, but it just takes a long time to get to that point.Initially limited to a choice of only a couple of alliances to pursue, your options of possible missions quickly balloons after the first 15 hours, with Randvi giving you several points of interest on your map. The game does encourage you down a pretty specific path--you may have four possible alliances to go after but maybe only two are within areas that match your current power level, for example. And the game doesn't give you every possible alliance at once. You're usually given them in batches of two to four, and get a new batch when the current one is complete. There are exceptions--you get some alliances early on that are located in very high power level areas, showcasing missions you should be working towards, not jumping at immediately. But this is more a suggestion than direction. You can go after alliances well above your power level if you want. As far as I can tell, you can go anywhere on the map as soon as you establish your settlement in England, even if the story isn't pointing you in that direction yet. Your attack damage and health will just be lower than what is advised. But even that can be fun. I've gone after a few alliances where Eivor would die in one or two hits from the high level enemies, pushing me to really learn the exact timing needed to dodge and deflect attacks. Regardless of what order you choose, you'll eventually make some sort of alliance with or conquer every part of England before the campaign is done. None of the missions that Randvi brings you are optional--you'll do all of them eventually.Eivor's lasting impact, or the potential for it, is an effective driving force to carry you through to this end. Figuring out how a random Viking from the 800s will save the world in 2020 is an intriguing proposition, especially since Valhalla does such a good job laying breadcrumbs of knowledge and small revelations throughout its runtime to keep you chasing the answer to that question.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0e5737a-d8a8-4cf4-bade-b4c3f6595263": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0e5737a-d8a8-4cf4-bade-b4c3f6595263", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "5727b45d-3928-4a45-9483-7cdf6f418500", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9924b187277c00cee23e1a70fa12ede125c84ac99e724c5439d4271753b98d9"}, "3": {"node_id": "e97b4098-4ef6-43f5-9ee6-4f18ffd1c02b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1efa99ddf0f072420d0d0fca9d3d7b9c8261ff878844a43c742cab66d2f234cc"}}, "hash": "555df2a61700c41482d670011c8fd1f6eccacf7ffd397578be91138a6a0c8598", "text": "The game quickly lays out that it's who Eivor is and what she ultimately does that is important, but then deftly sets up several possibilities. Eivor begins to become a respected leader and partner to Randvi in overseeing the settlement, an almost legendary warrior when acting in Sigurd's name and securing alliances, and an Assassin as she hunts for the Order of Ancients (precursors to the Templar Order) alongside the Hidden Ones (precursors to the Assassin Brotherhood). All the while, she tries to piece together the true meaning of her visions alongside Valka, the Raven Clan's seer, who talks Eivor through her emotional and mental turmoil. All of these plotlines mix together to form Valhalla's main campaign, informing Layla (and by extension, us) as to who Eivor is, while providing the clues needed to put together how everything in the franchise adds up. I love that, even once it's shown its entire hand, Valhalla doesn't actually explain everything. It just gives you pieces that are there to put an answer together.There's actually quite a bit of Assassin's Creed Valhalla that isn't explained, and the game is better for it since there's just so much to discover. For example, several characters and notes comment on the Hidden Ones existing in England years prior; you're told the group had six bureaus but that's about it. There are no waypoints and no direction for where to find one. And until you actually stumble upon one, it's not even really clear that you can find them. You know how I've found a few? Deductive reasoning. I opened my map, looked at the places I had visited, and thought like a Hidden One based on my understanding of them from previous games. The group likes to operate near cities of prominence, and since I knew they had last been in England when Rome ruled the country, I looked at cities built in the shadows of Roman ruins--specifically ones that seemed to have small buildings near the outskirts of the city. Within an hour, I found three bureaus. Inside, I discovered pieces of Hidden One armor--my favorite piece that I've found thus far is a cloak that gives Eivor the cool-looking beaked hood that's traditionally worn by the protagonists of the Assassin's Creed games.Valhalla trusted me to think like an explorer, to put myself in Eivor's shoes as she navigates and attempts to understand this new, unfamiliar world. The game's take on ninth-century England feels like an actual world to explore, which is a manageable task since you'll largely be sticking to contained areas for a narrative arc, then moving to a new location for the next one. Valhalla is the first Assassin's Creed game in a while where the main campaign saw me explore nearly the entire space. There are still plenty of pockets I've only sailed by and haven't actually walked through yet, but I finished the campaign feeling I had a solid grasp on the world I had explored. This is still a Ubisoft game that's packed with waypoints to follow for the main campaign and side missions, but in Valhalla, they're also designed to encourage you toward discovery--and the game has such wonderful, heartbreaking, hilarious, and intriguing things to look for. Sometimes, it's merely gameplay items like the aforementioned Hidden One's hood, but it can just as often be something that's technically useless but goes a long way towards filling in the gaps of what's happened in England prior to Eivor's arrival. If I weren't playing through the game for review on a deadline, my final playtime for Valhalla would have been much higher. I wanted to go off the beaten path more often than I had time for.Though Eivor is characterized as a bit of a lone wolf, her journey across England won't always see her travel alone. The easiest way to reach the furthest corners of England is sailing along the country's vast system of rivers and swamps via longship. Valhalla doesn't really do naval combat (you can shoot your bow from the ship to snipe soldiers on the shore); instead, your ship is primarily a means of transportation. It also livens up an otherwise lonely adventure--you can ask your crew to sing or tell stories. There's something so relaxing and peaceful about sailing through the grassy countryside of Mercia or past the ice-covered mountains of Northumbria as your clan of fellow Vikings bellow out a song.As much as I enjoyed discovering what England had to offer, there is one aspect of exploration that is a little grating: puzzles. Valhalla has several types of puzzles, the most common being obstacles that block your path. Sometimes it's a lock that needs a key or a barred door where you need to shoot the plank keeping it shut.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e97b4098-4ef6-43f5-9ee6-4f18ffd1c02b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e97b4098-4ef6-43f5-9ee6-4f18ffd1c02b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0e5737a-d8a8-4cf4-bade-b4c3f6595263", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "555df2a61700c41482d670011c8fd1f6eccacf7ffd397578be91138a6a0c8598"}, "3": {"node_id": "4af0c84c-5f02-4ddb-af2c-d4f0b59561a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4510af0c8b0681e4fa20282604e7ef8ced921f5adc09f8b5c73eb66efc07c933"}}, "hash": "1efa99ddf0f072420d0d0fca9d3d7b9c8261ff878844a43c742cab66d2f234cc", "text": "And sometimes it's racing around an entire castle for several minutes screaming, \"Where's the f*****g pot?\" in what seems like a tedious search for the one flammable oil jar that you need to pick up and slowly walk to the crumbling wall or floor you have to blow up. This kind of puzzle is a momentum killer--the most deadly assassin of them all.It's in combat that you find the most agency in how you shape Eivor. Earning skill points allows you to invest in the constellation-like skill tree, further buffing Eivor in the Way of the Raven (stealth combat skills), Way of the Bear (melee combat skills), and Way of the Wolf (ranged combat skills). The constellation of lines twist and turn on one another, allowing you to easily double-back and invest in more than one tree, while also having different branches of each tree cross over for more interesting build opportunities. You can respec Eivor's skills at any time for free, allowing you to easily reshape her if one combat style isn't to your liking.Regardless of where you put your skill points, Eivor is a badass raider who dual-wields weapons with a frenzied intensity. Valhalla encourages you to fight aggressively. Eivor doesn't regenerate health, and your healing rations are limited, so it's in your best interest to end fights as quickly as possible by assassinating an opponent or disrupting the tempo of their attacks with powerful strikes, counters, or blocks. Button mashing will deliver you to an early grave; strategically playing to your strengths is the only way to succeed against tougher foes.You can also fight enemies with social stealth, a former core mechanic of the Assassin's Creed franchise that hasn't been seen since 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate. When entering cities where Eivor isn't a trusted face, she dons a hood and wraps a cloak around herself. Choosing to drop the hood, sprint, bring out your weapons, climb structures, or do pretty much anything that an average person wouldn't do will draw attention, especially from those who want to kill you. This is used to great effect in some of the more tense story arcs, where Eivor is hunting members of the Order of Ancients in cities that the group or an enemy king controls, forcing her to stick to crowds, parkour across rooftops, utilize drunks to cause a distraction, and blend into the scenery until she can close in on her target and shank them with a hidden blade.However, Eivor's parkour mechanics aren't as good as those seen in some of the previous games (Assassin's Creed Unity still reigns supreme in this regard), so Eivor can feel a bit clunky when trying to stealth. It's frustrating when you accidently jump to your death because Eivor didn't quite snap to the next rooftop, or you are noticed in a crowd because--without a way to force Eivor to walk slowly--you push the thumbstick just a centimeter too much and send Eivor into a suspicious jog. I'm overjoyed to see social stealth return to Assassin's Creed, but since Valhalla's controls sometimes work against you, it occasionally feels like it would be easier to announce yourself and kill everyone in the vicinity instead. And if you want to do that, that's fine--Valhalla does not immediately fail you for being detected.Although the Assassin's Creed franchise will no doubt continue, there is a real sense of finality to Valhalla's main campaign. Valhalla brings together dozens of narrative threads--enough context is provided for newcomers to understand the general gist of what's going on, but even longtime fans may want to refresh themselves on the lore of the previous games to get everything out of Valhalla. It references nearly every mainline game in the franchise to tell you how they all connect, unifying a series that has largely felt separated into two distinct halves: the Desmond-Miles-saves-the-world era and the newer, more directionless one of 2013-2018.There have been so many lingering threads since Desmond's death, and only more have been created with the introduction of the Sages, new Pieces of Eden, the origins of the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order, and the now fairly convoluted modern-day storyline. Valhalla resolves all of this in an incredibly satisfying way. It does for the series what Assassin's Creed III did back in 2012: It clears the board while also paving the way for something brand new.Despite its strong connection to past games, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is more than capable of standing on its own.

You\u2019ll have that ax with you in the afterlife, on Odin\u2019s great hall and on the fields of an everlasting battle. So much of pop-culture Viking history centers around battles and raiding, and so does Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, but as the title suggests, the more important part is in what comes after, the mythology of death.This is also a complex saga of friendship, honor, and gods that the Norse people believed in. These are what life in Valhalla is ruled by, all at once by ax and by fate. It\u2019s a world largely seen through the eyes of Eivor, a stoic Norse warrior (or drengr, as the Vikings would say), who acts as the protagonist in Ubisoft\u2019s latest historical, open-world game. Valhalla is a long, sprawling saga of a game, one that blends myth and reality in a world that\u2019s rich with mystery.The backdrop to Eivor\u2019s personal complexities is the Viking expansion into England, as she and her brother break off from their father\u2019s rule to invest in a new land. This, of course, is where a lot of the killing comes in; the expansion into England is complicated by a largely intolerant group of Anglo-Saxons that controls much of the area. But this area of England, now called Raventhorpe, is also a lush world of wildlife, stunning scenery, and a growing community knotted by complicated relationships.Eivor\u2019s story begins with an early memory: At a celebration with her family and another Viking clan in Norway, Eivor\u2019s father Varin asks her to present a gift to King Styrbj\u00f6rn, a symbol of allyships between their separate clans. It\u2019s at this time that another clan, led by Kjotve the Cruel, attacks. The battle ensues before Kjotve offers Varin a second option: for Varin to give his life so the rest of the clan could live. Eivor\u2019s mother, Rosta, protests, willing Varin to fight, but he chooses to die \u2014 and Kjotve kills them both, and the battle continues.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

Her father\u2019s choice is deemed a cowardly move by many, including Eivor; other characters continually insist that her father died without honor. As if it were a betrayal. It\u2019s after this point that the player is asked to choose who to play, before the animus glitches out and Eivor and Sigurd (now her brother by adoption) return as adults journeying off to England with a new, mysterious friend who is part of a hidden order.Like Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey before it, Valhalla lets the player choose between a male or female character, but there\u2019s a third option: Let the Animus choose. Whatever you choose, you\u2019ll play as Eivor \u2014 just with changes in how she\u2019s presented and the pronouns used. I chose the female Eivor, though letting the Animus choose is a weird option, where the game will decide at different points to switch between the two versions. This happens for mysterious reasons that are explained by the modern-world framing device, which is a confusing storyline about how modern-day people access historical memories from people of the past.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25b4060c-9668-494f-998e-1eabad20f3e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "25b4060c-9668-494f-998e-1eabad20f3e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "4af0c84c-5f02-4ddb-af2c-d4f0b59561a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4510af0c8b0681e4fa20282604e7ef8ced921f5adc09f8b5c73eb66efc07c933"}, "3": {"node_id": "78a1002b-6d0c-441d-8ff4-3bb73fcd5916", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6da7ab1c936c54ded6a44bb30473adf023833fde7d4e6c7efcf368d79d1ef1ad"}}, "hash": "65fe7dabb8514a67c2e854c991db2d83e36c22bcb94ebe049431b3ad3c35cdbc", "text": "It\u2019s a spinoff of the larger story that\u2019s present throughout the franchise\u2019s history, a battle between Templars and Assassins \u2014 two powerful organizations that control large parts of the world \u2014 both of which have different visions of how the world should work. To me, the modern-day framing is confusing and I like to ignore it. Moving between those two worlds has always been jarring, so there was no way I was going to let any part of that \u2014 the Animus \u2014 chose my character for me.\n    Related\n  Ubisoft has said that both genders are considered \u201ccanon\u201d for the game, because of the choice option. But because there is really no difference between the options \u2014 aside from looks and voice \u2014 it feels hollow, especially given reports of how female Assassin\u2019s Creed characters have routinely been sidelined as main protagonists. The perception from Ubisoft\u2019s executives in the past, according to a Bloomberg report, was that \u201cfemale protagonists wouldn\u2019t sell\u201d \u2014 something indicative of a larger sexist culture at the company. It\u2019s worth noting, too, that Valhalla\u2019s development occurred during a tumultuous time for the global company, as dozens of people have accused staff members at Ubisoft, including some of its high-profile employees, of sexual misconduct and sexual assault, including accusations against former Valhalla creative director Ashraf Ismail. In June, Ubisoft began an internal investigation into allegations of deceptive infidelity on the part of Ismail, and in August, Ismail was fired.It\u2019s impossible for me to play this video game, let alone review it, without considering the environment and company culture at Ubisoft, especially given how Ubisoft has apparently perceived its female characters, a perception that goes back far into the franchise\u2019s history. For instance, in 2014, former Ubisoft creative director Alex Amancio notoriously told Polygon that an Assassin\u2019s Creed game couldn\u2019t have a playable female assassin because \u201cit was really a lot of extra production work.\u201d And so when I think about Valhalla and its character options, I wonder how much of this \u201cboth genders are canon\u201d thing plays into the history of women in Assassin\u2019s Creed.It feels complicated to grapple with, especially since I love how Eivor is portrayed in Valhalla. The way she struggles with her family history and her own destiny is fascinating, and her relationships mirror that complexity. She\u2019s contemplative, cunning, and viciously defends her clans; she\u2019s a true drengr. And that\u2019s interesting in itself, because drengr is a gendered term, typically used to describe a \u201cbold, valiant, worthy man,\u201d according to Richard Cleasby and Gudbrand Vigfusson\u2019s An Icelandic-English Dictionary.I like that this title is applied to her throughout the story without care for gender. It presents her not as an \u201cexceptional\u201d female character, but an exceptional character \u2014 almost an idyllic world where sexism is not as ingrained as it is in ours. Even as much as I like this characterization of Eivor\u2019s power, I wonder if it\u2019s less of a statement and more a result of the gender option, and how the story doesn\u2019t change between the two.Either way, I like Eivor \u2014 especially because her role is one that\u2019s rooted, too, in actual history. Some scholars of early northern European history suggest that, in this culture, gender was seen as more complex than the male/female binary: \u201cIs this a culture in which \u2018sex\u2019 per se is irrelevant and \u2018gender\u2019 is everything?\u201d medieval studies scholar Carol J. Clover asked in Regardless of Sex: Men, Women, and Power in Early Northern Europe. \u201cOr is it a culture that simply does not make a clear distinction but holds what we imagine to be two as one and the same thing?\u201dValhalla is securely a role-playing game with a stealth influence, instead of the other way around. It allows the player to enact both large-scale battles and quick assassinations while hidden within a crowd. The Vikings, too, introduce their own expression of stealth in their raids, where narrow longships sneak up to encampments to attack without warning. Eivor has an assassin\u2019s blade, a gift given to her from Sigurd. Hers, though, is not hidden \u2014 she wears it atop her cloak, because she wants her foes to see their fates in her weapon.And oh, the foes she has.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78a1002b-6d0c-441d-8ff4-3bb73fcd5916": {"__data__": {"id_": "78a1002b-6d0c-441d-8ff4-3bb73fcd5916", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "25b4060c-9668-494f-998e-1eabad20f3e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "65fe7dabb8514a67c2e854c991db2d83e36c22bcb94ebe049431b3ad3c35cdbc"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d0a0dd9-dd1b-44bf-a907-570aa897a968", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f93790652709376337d2c7a31650403558af0a7456a47c7230d04c49a683c3ed"}}, "hash": "6da7ab1c936c54ded6a44bb30473adf023833fde7d4e6c7efcf368d79d1ef1ad", "text": "Though some Danes, as the Saxons call them, live in peace with the Saxons, there\u2019s a lot of turmoil, and the core gameplay loop of Valhalla has Eivor \u201cpacifying\u201d different regions in England. Each of these different regions is presented as its own little saga, a contained package of storylines that (sometimes) end with an allyship in hand.These quests are quite varied, with a bunch of different activities to partake in. Combat design allows the player to choose a methodology in their attack. For instance, I\u2019m more of a brute-force kind of player, one who always announces a raid before bursting through a monastery\u2019s doors. Stealth plays a role occasionally and when necessary, but most of the time, the game lets me play how I prefer: I\u2019d rather cause chaos and deal with it than spend time planning out an attack. The beauty of it is that there are options, as is natural with an open-world game like this.Most of the time, quests involve doing a favor for someone in charge of any given region \u2014 whether that\u2019s driving off Saxon invaders or releasing captured fighters. It sometimes means helping people that Eivor doesn\u2019t quite like, a sacrifice in gaining security for the Raven Clan. There are choices to be made throughout these different regions, and though the regions are like contained sagas, the choices do overlap.Valhalla isn\u2019t a game that presents a particularly nuanced system for choices, though. This is still a case of whether you want to be a dick or be nice. (Eivor\u2019s choices always feel like they\u2019re guided by a sense of honor, whether that\u2019s good or bad.) I found, though, that sometimes the simplest decisions made me feel most conflicted, like whether I should let a shitty dude hold his ax while he\u2019s dying.Completing these objectives is how the storyline moves forward, but it\u2019s also a way for Eivor to earn skill points and level up. With each power level, new parts of Valhalla\u2019s ridiculous skill tree open up. Frankly, the full tree is overwhelming, and I started out just by clicking random things because I simply couldn\u2019t make a choice. The good news is that once I got used to the game and its systems, I felt more confident going back and wiping my skill tree clean to tailor it more to my play style. Because the world is open, there\u2019s essentially nothing stopping me from heading to an endgame-leveled region and trying to take something on. Will I succeed? Absolutely not. But can I try? Valhalla lets me.Like Polygon\u2019s Simone de Rochefort wrote in her Valhalla preview earlier in the year, the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise has been tangled up with religion since the beginning. But more recently, Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins and Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey have started incorporating myth and more varied ancient beliefs into the story. Myth is once again central to Valhalla, and myth and reality in the game are closely intertwined. So much so that the boundary between them barely exists.Odin, Frejya, and Valhalla are just as real to Eivor as is God to the monks whose monasteries the Vikings ransack. You can see this throughout the world, whether it\u2019s in the otherworldly quests or the more mundane ones.One of my favorite regions was one in which Eivor joined a community celebrating Samhain, a Pagan harvest\u2019s end festival that likely influenced our modern conception of Halloween. Residents of a large settlement that\u2019s split in the middle by a small river have decorated it all with turnips and lanterns. They give Eivor a costume to wear, the traditional Mari Lwyd costume with an animal\u2019s skull, and tell her to knock on doors reciting poems for treats. It\u2019s a night of mischief and celebration, which is a nice break from the violence of Viking life. (Of course, that all changes come the next morning.)\n    Related\n  There\u2019s a real joy in watching this stoic, serious woman gallop around town like a kid would \u2014 incessantly giddy about what she\u2019s collected. Despite how frankly goofy it is, it humanizes Eivor and fleshes out the world she lives in.The Samhain festival is more grounded than some of the other mythological questlines, where the boundaries between the worlds of humans and of gods are more complicated than in previous games in the series. Though the gameplay in Valhalla certainly feels familiar, the aggressive blur between reality and fantasy is a fascinating exploration of Norse mythology and belief.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d0a0dd9-dd1b-44bf-a907-570aa897a968": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d0a0dd9-dd1b-44bf-a907-570aa897a968", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "78a1002b-6d0c-441d-8ff4-3bb73fcd5916", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6da7ab1c936c54ded6a44bb30473adf023833fde7d4e6c7efcf368d79d1ef1ad"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c023be8-65b9-4df3-93b1-ad4d483c2a9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "abf399c74bde3f08846478bd9cd74bb18977ff5b8ea850552a73b307956466f0"}}, "hash": "f93790652709376337d2c7a31650403558af0a7456a47c7230d04c49a683c3ed", "text": "It\u2019s something that\u2019s always felt present in the franchise, but it\u2019s more fully realized in Valhalla. In some ways, I wish Valhalla focused more on the mythology and belief systems at play in the game, and less on the \u201cpacification\u201d of England. The Norse community becoming enmeshed into English land is a key part to the story of the Viking expansion of England \u2014 which makes it a key part of the story for Eivor and her brother Sigurd. But that\u2019s at the expense of pushing away the narrative of Eivor and Sigurd\u2019s weird relationship to themselves and to myth, in favor of conquering castles and ruins. I understand the desire to make an open-world game, one that\u2019s long and immersive and in a world that feels like you could live in it forever. I like that there\u2019s a lot to do. But there were large swaths of time where I simply forgot about Sigurd and my clan as I went off in search of monasteries to raid for silver.Valhalla\u2019s most intriguing story is one about faith, honor, and family, but it\u2019s buried inside this massive, massive world stuffed with combat and side quests. That balance is not always ideal, but I\u2019m glad, at least, that it forces me to spend more time seeking out interesting things in the game\u2019s world.

The first Assassin\u2019s Creed in two years, and the 12th major Assassin\u2019s Creed overall, it is the work of creators who are trying to honor the franchise\u2019s past while charting its future. They\u2019ve tried to change the formula for open-world games overall. And they\u2019ve taken a stab at portraying the dubious morality of Viking conquest. What\u2019s shocking is that Valhalla nearly always succeeds at these things, creating an impressive game that stands above many other contemporary open-world adventures. Like the previous Assassin\u2019s Creeds, Valhalla is a third-person open-world adventure featuring stealth action and lots of murder. And like those games, it features two storylines. One is set in the modern-day, including characters and narrative elements that have been around since the 2007 original. That story of Assassins fighting Templars involves ancient pre-human civilizations, secret wars between shadowy groups, and powerful artifacts of old. The other storyline\u2014the one you spend 95% of the game playing\u2014is set around 875 AD, when Vikings and their clans left Norway and explored and conquered parts of England and Europe.In the modern day, you play as Layla Hassan, a researcher introduced in 2017\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins who continued to star in the modern day sequences in 2018\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey. Layla and her crew of Assassins are trying to stop the world from ending, and they\u2019ve traveled to the final resting spot of a special Viking named Eivor. They believe that this Viking and his or her past may hold the secret to saving the modern world from disaster. To experience Eivor\u2019s history and story, Layla enters the Animus, a device that allows people to re-live the lives of people from the past, using their DNA memories... or something. It\u2019s just magic science mumbo-jumbo, don\u2019t think about it too much.Once in the Animus, you take on the role of Eivor, a Viking warrior whose parents were killed when they were young. . Eivor is raised by Styrbjorn, the clan\u2019s king and essentially becomes siblings with the king\u2019s son, Sigurd.Players can choose to control a male Eivor, a female Eivor or take a third option that alternates between the two.

It means Eivor is treated the same, man or woman, which is nice but also feels like a missed opportunity.The game begins in Norway, where players first lead Eivor in a quest for revenge. Soon, the game is about politics. Eivor and Sigurd become fed up with the king and his decisions about how to rule. They recruit their friends to join them in departing Norway and sailing to England. Once in England, Eivor\u2019s mission is to help her clan build a thriving settlement in a new world, while exploring and fighting to create allies across all of England.This setup gives all of Valhalla a compelling, consistent sense of purpose and momentum. In not only the main narrative, but also the gameplay and progression. It gives Valhalla more structure than previous Assassin\u2019s Creed games, which sometimes meandered for hours before finding the plot again. In Valhalla, nearly everything you do feeds into this narrative of exploring, conquering and building allies with other kingdoms.For those who haven\u2019t played the previous games, Valhalla should be easy to follow. While there are references to other games, the bulk of Eivor\u2019s story is separate from the series\u2019 meta-narrative. Only the end of the game, which I won\u2019t spoil here, seems to expect knowledge of the franchise\u2019s modern-day storylines, with so many cross-references that even a longtime fan like me was checking a wiki to sort it all out.\u201cA Viking\u2019s Life For Me\u201d Open-world-action-RPG-stab-a-thonThe world, the narrative structure, big battles, gorgeous vistasSome wonky stealth gameplay, handling of Viking historyUbisoft MontrealNovember 10PS4 (played), PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Stadia66 hoursValhalla\u2019s biggest and most interesting addition to the Assassin\u2019s Creed formula are its Kingdoms. These are large sections of the map ruled by various kings, lords, bishops and noblemen. As Eivor, you decide which of these kingdoms to focus on. You spend a few hours talking to people there, figuring out how you can forge an alliance with this kingdom. Sometimes it involves working with the king in charge. Other times, you\u2019ll be tasked with overthrowing a monarchy or helping a young king learn how to lead and survive his enemies. Each kingdom took me two to four hours to complete and felt like a season of a TV show. Kingdoms are separate from the main overarching plot of Valhalla, which involves Assassins, relics, secrets and powerful enemies hiding in the shadows. But they still move Eivor and your clan\u2019s story forward. And like a good TV show, these seasons regularly end with a narrative climax that feels satisfying.These kingdoms are where the game tries to balance who Vikings were and how brutal they could be as they invaded foreign lands. Players spend a lot of time in this game working with local communities and towns, helping them and learning from them. But you also spend a good amount of time raiding churches and fighting wars against locals and invaders. Eivor seems to understand that what is happening isn\u2019t always fair or nice to the English who call this land home. She comments directly about this and at times shows remorse. However, she never stops expanding her clan and raiding. Ultimately, Valhalla tilts its sympathies toward the Norse fighters. They show them as courageous, but bloodthirsty warriors and invaders who are willing to burn a church down for silver. Yet they also show the compassionate side of them and emphasize many Vikings\u2019 desire for a new life, free from oppressive kings and never-ending war. Of course, they ended up in England, a land filled with oppressive kings and never-ending wars. The more things change\u2026While kingdoms and their self-contained quests are the biggest and best change to the Assassin\u2019s Creed gameplay loop, there are other changes that address shortcomings from the formula introduced with the franchise-changing Origins and its successor, Odyssey. While those games were big, open, and felt better to play, a lot of repeated side activities and quests also made them at times monotonous and repetitive.Valhalla strips some things down and rearranges others. Side quests are very different. Gone, for the most part, are the lengthy sidequests of Origins and Odyssey that could take players on a multi-step journey through a large section of the game\u2019s world. Instead, the map in Valhalla is filled with smaller, quicker, and more varied activities and quests to do and see.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56b521df-bbfd-4e44-b220-cd6a766ef841": {"__data__": {"id_": "56b521df-bbfd-4e44-b220-cd6a766ef841", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c023be8-65b9-4df3-93b1-ad4d483c2a9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "abf399c74bde3f08846478bd9cd74bb18977ff5b8ea850552a73b307956466f0"}, "3": {"node_id": "342bdee0-1ced-46c3-9212-81ec306a7ee1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4764ab3a7678ae178e8d4086e997857487600d444dd1c7fcfc8c8dc9d0448312"}}, "hash": "0527453cb00fbd4bfef227871a9d7d8111e6d63e66d65f4682f368c40fda2e83", "text": "Sure, there are still random people to help out there, but their problems are often smaller and don\u2019t involve trekking around the map. For example, on a mountainside in Norway, I found a Viking who was sleepwalking and needed me to help him back to his camp. In England, I stumbled upon some nuns who were trying to escape the country and who needed protection. One of my favorite encounters involved a Viking couple who felt their relationship was dull and boring. So they asked me to break things and start a fire in their home so they could feel the passion again, like when they were younger and fought in battles side by side. (Spoilers: It worked.)These encounters don\u2019t clog up your quest journal. You find them by exploring down glowing dots on your map. What you find usually only takes a few minutes and sticks to one small area of the world, like a house, a tree, a camp or a river. Because of this, I felt compelled to finish them whenever I happened to find one in the world.In other open-world games, I would find myself avoiding some side content because it was just more hours of busywork. But in Valhalla these tiny encounters kept me playing long past my bedtime, and not because I wanted some new weapon or gear, but just because I wanted to see what new mini-story I was about to encounter.Valhalla also deviates from some of the tedious aspects of Origins and Odyssey with its streamlined loot system. While you do find new gear and weapons in the game, it\u2019s much more limited. You won\u2019t be collecting thousands of bows and helmets just to sell them. Instead, there is a set amount of gear and weapons in the world, and once you find them you won\u2019t find them again. They don\u2019t just drop off enemies, either. Instead, they are always found at the end of quests or in specifically marked spots on the map, often involving the completion of an environmental puzzle. The key benefit of this change is you won\u2019t spend dozens of hours fiddling with inventory management, allowing you to focus on gear you like and level it up using materials you find in the world.Don\u2019t be mistaken, this is a big Ubisoft game, so there is still a lot of content in the world for you to find and complete. It\u2019s just more varied and interesting. Gone are the thousands of enemy bases and treasure chests seen in Odyssey. Instead, you have strange puzzles to solve, cursed lands to cure, and small stories to experience. The overall effect of this is that I found myself losing hours of playtime just exploring the world, curious what new thing I might find or puzzle I might discover over the next hill. It\u2019s very easy to spend hours and hours in this game before you even realize it, and rarely did it feel like a grind.While many fans enjoyed the previous games, some, including myself, felt the franchise was forgetting its origins and disliked that it had become less focused on stealth and assassinations. Valhalla isn\u2019t a full return to the more classic stealth-focused Assassin\u2019s Creed games, but it\u2019s clear the developers wanted to bring back some of that classic action in this new game.So, pretty quickly into Valhalla, you receive a hidden blade from a pair of Hidden Ones (a.k.a. Assassins before they called themselves that). Eivor herself isn\u2019t an Assassin, but she does learn a few tactics from these two Assassins, including how to use the blade and how to blend in to hide in plain sight. The main tool for doing this is a hood, which players can equip when they enter cities where Vikings aren\u2019t welcome. With this hood, you can carefully walk by enemies without them noticing you, blend in with crowds, or chill on a bench with a random civilian. These are all stealth options that have appeared in previous games, and it\u2019s nice to see them return in Valhalla, even if it doesn\u2019t always work. Sometimes I thought I was safe to kill someone and then the whole town was still alerted to me. Other times I would try to assassinate someone, but the game would bug out and I would be left exposed in the middle of a large crowd of angry guards. This kind of jank has always existed in Assassin\u2019s Creed games, so if you were able to put up with it before, you should be fine. But it is worth mentioning that these issues\u2014and issues with climbing up walls or missing jumps\u2014are still present. They\u2019re series staples, too, I guess.Another returning feature in Valhalla is the ability to grow and improve your own personal settlement.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "342bdee0-1ced-46c3-9212-81ec306a7ee1": {"__data__": {"id_": "342bdee0-1ced-46c3-9212-81ec306a7ee1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "56b521df-bbfd-4e44-b220-cd6a766ef841", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0527453cb00fbd4bfef227871a9d7d8111e6d63e66d65f4682f368c40fda2e83"}, "3": {"node_id": "646935cd-b01d-46c0-bd07-2dcd7aecb987", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c866a1b0aed83d7449eaabe9f1003ca11fe05410212c45c157ea6063f043d0c"}}, "hash": "4764ab3a7678ae178e8d4086e997857487600d444dd1c7fcfc8c8dc9d0448312", "text": "This works similarly to the Villa in Assassin\u2019s Creed II and your homestead in Assassin\u2019s Creed III At the start of the game, the settlement is nothing more than a few tents and an old longhouse on a hill filled with bandits. As you build it up, new characters start to appear and some of them have their own stories and quests you can complete if you want to learn more about your clan. Additionally, you can unlock new features, like the ability to help the Hidden Ones take down targets, a way to customize your longship, or the ability to catch and sell fish. Most of this stuff isn\u2019t vital to finishing the game, but it does help make your clan and their home feel more alive and personal. I built that tattoo shop. I helped create that farm. And when bad things would happen to my home or the people who lived there, I felt more invested in helping make things right or getting revenge.The main way you build up your settlement is by completing raids. Raiding in Valhalla is all about you and your clanmates attacking and pillaging large monasteries that can be found all over the map. Each monastery has treasure and resources to plunder, though you\u2019ll have to fight through large groups of enemies to reach it, and you\u2019ll need help from your fellow Vikings. These raids, while fun, are another example of Ubisoft trying to walk the tightrope between portraying Vikings as invaders and settlers. For example, the game doesn\u2019t force you to be hostile. You can actually just walk around these monasteries while wearing your hood and avoiding guards. And if you do decide to blow your Viking attack horn to start a raid, you can\u2019t freely kill monks or innocent people who are running for their lives. Doing so will cause you to fail the raid. Even if you spare the innocents and only attack churches, you are still burning homes and churches to the ground and stealing their stuff. The main excuse the game provides is that the monasteries are run by corrupt bastards. It\u2019s historically accurate that Vikings raided, but for those not comfortable living out the fantasy of being a colonizing invader, raids will most likely leave a sour taste in your mouth. For me, it left me with mixed feelings about Eivor and her clan. I still liked them and cared about what happened to them, but I couldn\u2019t shake this nagging feeling in the back of my mind while they laughed and cried, that they also murdered and pillaged.After over 60+ hours of playing Assassin\u2019s Creed: Valhalla, I was surprised by how well it was able to innovate while bringing back classic elements, like social stealth and settlement development. I wish there was a bit more sneaky-sneaky action here, but was glad to at least see an increase from recent games. Valhalla also does a good job portraying the Vikings as deadly invaders and lost settlers looking for a new life.The changes Valhalla brings to the franchise feel as great as a warm hearthfire during a cold winter night. The game\u2019s developers have crafted a world that is wonderful to explore, that soaked up hours and hours of my day before I noticed It. The changes to how the game handles loot and questing, for example, make it a nicer experience to play. Overall, it feels a lot of care and thought went into making Valhalla feel less like a checklist of things to do and more like a world to organically experience.This might not be what longtime fans who miss the more stealth-oriented games wanted, but for those looking for a big, open-world that isn\u2019t boring, there aren\u2019t much better than Valhalla. \nUSgamer, A fantastic historical setting is once again weighed down by all the cruft we've come to associate with Assassin's Creed.This article first appeared on USgamer, a partner publication of VG247.

Glory or mercy; pagan or Christian salvation\u2014whatever choice Eivor thinks is right reflects a cultural and spiritual outlook that will always be at odds with its alternative.In scenes like this, Valhalla is at its best. It portrays a nuanced understanding of what we can imagine might have occupied the minds of a character like Eivor during the tumultuous end of the ninth century, at the height of the Scandinavian Viking Age. After leaving her home in Norway due to the drastic changes in life brought about by King Harald Finehair's unification of the burgeoning nation, Eivor and her foster brother Sigurd arrive in an England wracked with the disorder of the Viking Great Heathen Army's invasion less than a decade earlier. With the Scandinavian colonists having firmly established themselves by the time Valhalla opens, Eivor arrives in an England whose competing Anglo-Saxon kingdoms are largely conquered and in general disarray.She and Sigurd lead their followers to an abandoned camp, begin making contact with other Vikings as well as pliable Anglo-Saxon leaders, and the shape of how Valhalla plays out starts to become clear. From her camp's great hall, Eivor can survey a map of England and find regions (marked by a suggested \"power level\" analogous to her own experience level) where locals need her support to solve a problem. Selecting one of these locations kicks off a chain of missions, called, in proper Viking fashion, \"Sagas\" that basically function as a short story contained within the overarching narrative. Eivor heads to the region and, like the two most recent, RPG-flavored Assassin's Creeds, Odyssey and Origins, ends up fighting enemies, investigating areas filled with books and bloodstains that glow green with a click of the right thumb stick, and running back and forth a whole bunch to talk to various characters.  Between essential tasks, she can climb fortress turrets, mountains, or church steeples to make treasure locations and side-stories pop up on the map, which quickly cover the formerly blank space like a rash. From here, as in the past, Eivor can find places to hunt wildlife for equipment-upgrading materials, search for new weapons or armor, and complete brief tasks provided by ancillary characters. All of this will be immediately familiar to anyone who played Odyssey or Origins. Despite minor tweaks to the series' equipment system, which is thankfully scaled down from the loot deluge of its predecessors, as well as the combat and exploration\u2014Eivor can now blend in with crowds, as in older Assassin's Creed games, though enemies detect her quickly enough that it's only occasionally useful\u2014everything is very much the same as it was in the last two entries to the series. In keeping with bringing back some of the older mechanics, Valhalla's role-playing focus is lessened, too. A saga set in Wessex may show a skill level number far above the player's own, but this doesn't mean that the area is off limits until Eivor has leveled up enough. While Valhalla doesn't do a great job of explicitly explaining this, even the \"highest level\" parts of the map can be accessed when Eivor's own level is far lower. The enemies are simply tougher in these cases, as if a built-in difficulty slider has been increased a notch temporarily. But though these kinds of changes may seem like substantial ones, they ultimately do little to make Valhalla feel like a real departure from Assassin's Creed Odyssey or Assasin's Creed Origins. Instead, they mostly cut out a bit of the time-wasting level grind and equipment swapping that existed before, streamlining the old style of design by snipping away some of its fluff.  It's not all a retread, though. New to Assasin's Creed Valhalla are flyting competitions\u2014poetic exchanges of insults that, in practice, only require the player to recognize basic rhymes and meters in a list of options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3826867d-fa1f-4007-aea7-72747b7923a8": {"__data__": {"id_": "3826867d-fa1f-4007-aea7-72747b7923a8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "646935cd-b01d-46c0-bd07-2dcd7aecb987", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c866a1b0aed83d7449eaabe9f1003ca11fe05410212c45c157ea6063f043d0c"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f447b3f-70f2-402f-82a4-9f8ac95da3d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "91c85fa024d42bb70dc8c07b59f3be4dae62889b6cc6d109d9308d23357a721e"}}, "hash": "41b8cb8f8d25f378eb4b704a778152622b276d9ed8fc268ec282eddcc9d33baa", "text": "Eivor can also play a (pretty good) dice game, competitively drink horns of mead, and funnel resources gathered by pillaging locations throughout England into the building of a settlement, wherein she can change her hair and tattoos, upgrade equipment, host stat-boosting feasts, and get up to other kinds of busywork, essential or not. Most importantly, Eivor can also raid monasteries and abbeys by guiding a crew of warriors along a network of English rivers in her longship.Raiding in Valhalla is as thrilling (and vaguely horrifying) as it sounds. It involves Eivor and maybe a half dozen warriors storming a location defended by varying numbers of Anglo-Saxon soldiers as bells ring, guttural basso profundo singing plays on the soundtrack, and hapless priests, nuns, and peasants try to flee their homes. Ornate chests containing church relics or other valuables can be pushed open by Eivor and another Viking. They knock through barred doors and carelessly shove the lids off reliquaries, leaving corpses twisted under stained glass windows and flames roaring atop the wattle and daub roofs of sacred and secular buildings.These raids eventually become predictable and rote with repetition, but for a time they accentuate the horrific brutality and cultural ruthlessness that characterized so much of the Middle Ages. In them, the mystery and mutual suspicion of people of drastically different understandings of the world erupts into bloody violence. Elsewhere, Valhalla achieves a more subdued, but eerie sense of alienation in Eivor's travels across a gorgeously rendered vision of ninth-century England. The rolling sunlit hills, lush green valleys, and wide fields bursting with harvest-ready crops capture the natural beauty of the British Isles, while ancient, pre-Saxon monuments, northern mountain ranges thick with snow, and gloomy primeval forests are appropriately haunted and foreboding.   The characters Eivor meets on her travels, for their part, alternate between welcoming and threatening. Eivor is a flat character\u2014at least when played as a woman; Valhalla allows players to choose between a female or male Eivor during its introduction. She's a raspy-voiced blank slate, interested only in doggedly pursuing whatever task's laid out for her. Her personality isn't defined by much other than that bland kind of video game morality that's divorced of any discernible ideology other than a righteous anger at the evils of her enemies. In comparison with Origin's Bayek or Odyssey's Kassandra\u2014the latter of whom is so well-written that she single-handedly makes up for an otherwise meandering plot\u2014Eivor is a remarkably bland lead.Luckily, she's surrounded by an exceptional cast. Valhalla's England is populated by important historic figures, like Alfred the Great, King of Wessex and eventual King of Anglo-Saxon England, and Guthrum, the Viking leader who signed an agreement with Alfred that established the Danelaw region while introducing (largely) peaceful relations between Viking and Anglo-Saxon. It also presents a distinctly human version of characters whose stories are often shrouded in the myth-making of the Scandinavian saga-writers. Ivar the Boneless and his brothers, Ubba and Halfdan, children of the half-legendary Ragnar Lodbrok, are brought down to earth in Valhalla's story as realistically mortal military commanders and politicians. Aside from them, the memorable personalities of the bit players who feature in the game's many \"sagas,\" enliven stories of perilous diplomacy, cultural uncertainty, and war. Christian and pagan traditions\u2014whether Norse, Celtic, or otherwise\u2014butt up against one another again and again, animated by characters whose hopes for the future of the Isles is influenced as much by their spiritual beliefs as material desires.  As with most everything in Valhalla, though, the game's self-imposed Assassin's Creed trappings hamper these successes. The saga structure is a smart way to define the sprawling narrative through discrete chapters, but even with it lending shape to the story, Valhalla is simply far too long, overstuffed, and burdened by the series' legacy. More than a few of the sagas feel like side missions that have been extended a bit too far, their inciting incidents and narrative arcs repeating plot points about cultural suspicion, power struggles, and struggles between old and new religions that have already been made elsewhere.The game hardly benefits from their inclusion, either.

These problems haven't recurred since a pre-release patch, but it's hard to say whether that means they've been fixed completely. Thankfully, aside from the occasional sludgy camera movement in bigger cities and during larger battles, the game looks remarkably good on an older console and runs well enough for those not in a hurry to buy a new system. Beyond all that, Valhalla sags for the same reason as so many other Assassin's Creed games: it's too long and there's too much cruft in it. The sense of place established by the beautiful landscapes and soundtrack are interrupted by the appearance of glowing mini-map icons on the top of the screen indicating a nearby treasure or side-mission characters yelling their same request for Eivor's help on loop. They render the world utilitarian and, if completed in the midst of a story segment, temper the urgency and mess with the pace of the plot at hand.This has been a consistent problem in Assassin's Creed since its second entry. Each stunningly detailed historical diorama entices players with the promise of exploring the past before cluttering these depictions with far too many distractions. The series gives audiences explorable recreations of 18th-century Paris, 16th-century Constantinople, and vast swathes of Ptolemaic Egypt, but, as if worried that coupling these locations with an engaging story isn't enough, cover each location with the open world game equivalent of really persistent carnival barkers. Rather than rethink this style of design, Odyssey, the most recent Assassin's Creed, indulged it even further. Its ancient Greece was lousy with side activities, and its story was told at a loose, lazy pace that, despite its strengths, suffered too often just from going on far longer than it needed to. Valhalla, with its generally strong saga stories and exceptionally realized landscape, suffers from this issue more than most simply because what's being tampered with would obviously be so much stronger without distractions.Worse, the larger fiction of the Assassin's Creed series, with its Templars and Assassins, Isu civilization, and unremarkable 21st century cast, pops up time and time again to interrupt the far more interesting historical plot. These elements all feel like barnacles on the game's plot and design; vestigial concepts whose removal from the series are long overdue, and nowhere is it clearer how much they drag the series' historical fiction down than in entries like Valhalla, which otherwise succeed so well.So many of the game's characters struggle with how to live (and think) in an era of vast political and cultural upheaval. They see the future as a frightening void that could end up pagan or Christian, Viking or Anglo-Saxon, filled with opportunity or made miserable by scarcity and persecution. These ninth-century characters mainly end up doing best when they embrace the uncertainty of their moment in time, focus on the basic human values that matter most to them, and hold onto those decisions as they head forward into the chaos of a world in flux. If Valhalla took the lessons it so often teaches through its story and was similarly flexible in design, it would be a much better game for it, whether it needed the Assassin's Creed surtitle slapped in front of its name or not.\r\nConclusionAssassin's Creed Valhalla's vision of ninth-century England is a beautiful place to explore, populated with a great cast of characters who make up for the bland new protagonist, Eivor. Nevertheless, the tired overarching story of Templars and Assassins, and a design ethos that overstuffs the setting with side activities, add unnecessary bloat and distractions to the experience. Valhalla's a solid action-adventure game that does well to capture the turmoil of its historical era, but it's weighed down by the increasingly ponderous legacy of the series it represents.\n        Sign in and unlock a world of features\n      \n        Get access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dbd14d8-d891-4cae-9048-ba3156fc31bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "7dbd14d8-d891-4cae-9048-ba3156fc31bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f447b3f-70f2-402f-82a4-9f8ac95da3d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "91c85fa024d42bb70dc8c07b59f3be4dae62889b6cc6d109d9308d23357a721e"}, "3": {"node_id": "74327162-6fab-47af-9310-738cfc036e14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28f035b3dd5021b6f55923610406f917d18561bd34a12a3e9d1b7236b28e919d"}}, "hash": "053de2a2bc545ffc58cfb8083485fd9d00672905d35bbdb7774af6018f32042d", "text": "Close    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nReid McCarter\n\n          Contributor\n        \nPlease enable JavaScript to see comments.      \n\nGREATEST HITS\n\n\nCrimson Desert looks like all your favourite RPGs rolled into one                    \n\n\nASSASSIN WEEKEND\n\n\nPlay five Assassin's Creed games for free this weekend                    \n\n\nVALHALLA AND BEYOND\n\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u2019s final update is here                    \n\n\nCue The Music\n\n\nA video game has won a Grammy for the first time, and it was DLC                    \n\n\nHoods Up, Guardian\n\n\nDestiny 2 and Assassin's Creed crossover is a match made in Valhalla                    \n\n\nABOUT TIME\n\n\nUbisoft games returning to Steam after a three-year hiatus starting with Assassin's Creed Valhalla                    \n\n\nVERTU BLESSA\u00d0UR\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla epilogue releases in December, won't include New Game+ mode                    \n\n\nALTA\u00cfR WE GO\n\n\n15 years of Assassin\u2019s Creed: Why there\u2019s never been a better time to replay the first game                    \n\n\nTEXTBOOK BOONDOGGLE\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 review: The best psychological horror game I\u2019ve played in generations                    \n\n\nGOTTA RUN\n\n\nGhostrunner 2 review: an imperfect game that understands the rule of cool                    \n\n\nLIQUID'S IN\n\n\nMetal Gear Solid Master Collection (Vol 1) review: A soft collection of solid games                    \n\n\nSHOTS MISSED\n\n\nLords of the Fallen review: fertile ground for a sequel, but leaves a lot to be desired                    \n\n\nCITY PERFORMANCE\n\n\nCities Skylines 2 review: a solid foundation for a spec-hungry future classic                    \n\n\nTUSKMASTER\n\n\nSuper Mario Bros.

England and Norway are lush in their own ways; the former full of trees and greenery and the latter covered in white frost. HDR does wonders for the game, especially as the sun washes over the landscape or sets in the distance. Brightly colored longships and longhouses also benefit from the same treatment, albeit in a different way as it brings attention to the lovingly created items from Norse culture.Although beauty does not override how uninspired the actual world is. England may be visually appealing but forests and rolling hills grow stale rather quickly as they repeat over and over across the vast landmass. Many, many open-world games \u2014 including 2018\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey \u2014 are filled with a similar type of terrain, plainly displaying how unoriginal and tired such open fields are. Valhalla\u2019s fields are even more open and empty than usual, too, because of how few cities decorate its land and offer a chance of pace. The time period explains why this is an unfortunate reality, but that does not excuse it. Norway and Asgard are more unique but are unfortunately such small parts of the game.England does not earn its scale and only wastes the player\u2019s time as they ride back and forth between missions that are similarly mind-numbing. Valhalla, even on its insultingly easy Pathfinder exploration difficulty, asks very little of the player. It leads them by the nose from objective to objective, offering little in the way of actual exploration and discovery. Players are almost never rewarded or encouraged to figure things out or experiment. Almost everything important is marked and incredibly straightforward, keeping the player\u2019s brain a constant, near-vegetative state as they do what the game tells them.Open-world games are slowly starting to embrace creativity and Valhalla\u2019s overbearing grasp on the player and lack of tools is suffocating in comparison. More freeform goals with multiple acceptable paths and a rich, reactive world would be a thoughtful step forward in modernizing the series. Railroading players down one path and not leaving much room for freedom squanders its potential and makes the game feel like it was ripped out of an open-world design document from 2013. Valhalla doesn\u2019t step into the current era and quickly grows stale because of it \u2014 a negative aspect that compounds when compared to its two recent and remarkably similar predecessors.While Valhalla doesn\u2019t venture into much new territory, it does at least combine the combat styles of both Origins and Odyssey, utilizing the defensive posture of the former while simultaneously holding the aggressive nature of the latter. Even with the needlessly obfuscated and obtuse skill tree it comes with, the mix of styles creates a solid balance as the stamina-dependent defensive side keeps it from being mashy while the ability wheel adds more options and some much-needed visual flair. Enemies come in multiple shapes and sizes and their varying strategies stave off repetition.Repetition can set in if players find some exploitative killer strategy, which is all too simple. Some abilities and attacks can be linked together and looped in such a way that can repeatedly stagger the most intimidating Vikings and turn them into the shame of their clan. And when effective strategies like that are so easy to find and even easier to abuse, it weakens the entire combat system and all of the options it holds. Delving into the dual-wielding system or wealth of unlockable powers is a hard ask when two axes and the slam can kill nearly everything with ease.Stealth doesn\u2019t even have a bright side and is dramatically downplayed in Valhalla, a sad truth that is symbolized in how protagonist Eivor wields the iconic hidden blade: on their forearm for all to see. Options are too limited (even more so than Odyssey) and thus limit how you can play with the environment and the enemies. And as such, the basics of shooting arrows and waiting in waist-high bushes becomes the all-too-boring norm that has grown monotonous over the years. The new cloak sections attempt to bring back the social stealth from the first game, but they\u2019re also overly restrictive and too slow. Vikings make for lousy assassins and that conceptually makes sense, but the gameplay shouldn\u2019t suffer because of that incongruent comparison.Bad AI puts a hamper on stealth in multiple, sometimes conflicting ways. Enemies bounce between being completely braindead to having the eyes of an eagle and the all-knowing perception of a god.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08a7160b-3ebe-4457-8e2f-682673600ec8": {"__data__": {"id_": "08a7160b-3ebe-4457-8e2f-682673600ec8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "74327162-6fab-47af-9310-738cfc036e14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28f035b3dd5021b6f55923610406f917d18561bd34a12a3e9d1b7236b28e919d"}, "3": {"node_id": "0fad11ce-8541-4b44-aead-5af0d3c46339", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "20b2e60168189f68161bdc0de03b3625574aadea6edc2be1e2078d8174e97219"}}, "hash": "f46aee1c79da89b9a9cfe38e16cb2fc546a21e6c133852a23799fb1d69511e6f", "text": "They\u2019ll detect you through walls and across a field with their back turned as often as they\u2019ll fail to see their buddy drop dead right next to them. Friendly AI can be similarly stupid as allies can get hung up on simple tasks like helping you open up a chest or following you down a ladder.Part of this may be due to the game\u2019s shaky technical foundation. While patches are said to be coming, Valhalla is prone to crashing and the occasional glitch. Text can continually reappear, models could have trouble popping in, lips might not sync, and other polish-related issues can give the impression that the game isn\u2019t as complete as it should be; something that is harder to justify given its borrowed foundation. Long loads are in a different category of technical shortcomings, but still drag the game down as it can take multiple minutes to load a save and dozens of seconds to load into a cutscene or vendor menu.Valhalla already asks a lot of the player\u2019s time as it is a ridiculously long game, dwarfing even Odyssey and its elongated hour-count. Length isn\u2019t an inherently damning prospect, but it has to be earned and Valhalla does not come close to earning its 60 to 70 hours for a multitude of reasons.A lot of its follies stem from its storytelling style that focuses on smaller, two-hour side stories over one overarching one. These side stories, or arcs, lack any sort of theme or message and only pantomime drama that it usually doesn\u2019t bother setting up well. Solving an area\u2019s drama yields that area\u2019s trust and while the details change, the relatively low interest level hardly does as most characters, Eivor included, aren\u2019t always the most memorable faces, despite the mostly well-written dialogue. It\u2019s all clinical setup done in such a short amount of time.Most of the arcs are forgettable in a vacuum but even more so once taken in the grand scheme of things as there barely is a grand scheme at all. Eivor heads to England seemingly on a whim to \u201cpacify\u201d the land, create a settlement, and buddy up with the local kingdoms. Racking up alliances has no endgame; it is the endgame. The best RPGs, like the best television shows, know how to make strong, individual narratives in each episode that also contribute to the bigger picture. Valhalla\u2019s lack of a bigger picture further robs these already uninteresting chapters of the meaning\u00a0since it all feels aimless without something gluing them all together \u2014 an issue that gets exponentially worse as the game drags on and on with more and more purposeless side plots.But even Eivor\u2019s loose main goal is troublesome because of how the game glosses over the inherent issues that come with violent expansion. Moving into a new land and killing the natives to grab their property deserves justification or some examination, something the game couldn\u2019t be less interested in doing. Having control over what kind of Viking Eivor is would not only inject some woefully-needed player agency in the narrative, but it would also offer fertile grounds for such commentary. Having to deal with your consequences of your bloodthirsty reign or non-violent methods seems made for an RPG like this.The villages that Eivor and their crew burns down and picks clean are seemingly filled with poor, innocent people that likely don\u2019t deserve such a fate. Eivor is the villain and, in many cases, reasonably so. Even the British soldiers aren\u2019t properly demonized enough to explain away killing them on sight in their country. Such a premise is ripe for examination or critique, but the game just treats it as a fun mechanic that you shouldn\u2019t think too hard about.Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla should serve as a learning experience like Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity, the last installment that forced Ubisoft to rethink its approach. Valhalla\u2019s unnecessarily inflated hour count, limited stealth mechanics, disconnected story, and overwhelming sense of familiarity all point to a series once again on the decline because of its inability to focus on its strengths. Obsessing over playtime and Content\u2122 at the cost of innovation and depth puts Valhalla\u2018s ability to actually get into Valhalla in question, as it doesn\u2019t quite earn the kind of glory that only the best Vikings achieve.Game Revolution reviewed Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla on PS4.

It really drove home how different this Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00a0is from all the other Assassin\u2019s Creeds. In previous games, maybe Origins or Odyssey, I would\u2019ve methodically dismantled entire fortresses and earned that same achievement within the first few hours.Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is indiscreet and inelegant. It\u2019s a brash spectacle that\u2019s more interested in glorifying the toils of war than with quietly subduing and destabilizing the enemy. It\u2019s more Viking than assassin, so much that Valhalla\u00a0feels out of place in the Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00a0lineage. It\u2019s a wayward-growing branch on the family tree.Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey\u00a0was the Least Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00a0Game Ever\u00a0two years ago to great effect. Valhalla\u00a0strayed too far to its own detriment.Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u00a0(PC, PS4, PS5, Stadia, Xbox One [reviewed], Xbox Series X) Developer: Ubisoft Montreal Publisher: Ubisoft Released:\u00a0November 10, 2020 MSRP: $59.99The Vikings are going to England! After an extended prologue in Norway, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u00a0protagonist Eivor and his/her brother Sigurd take on the Saxons in England. (I played as male Eivor, so, in the name of simplicity, let\u2019s just use he/him pronouns for the rest of the review.) It\u2019s a beautiful land, and the Vikings intend to take every square inch of it.That\u2019s the real impetus for this entire tale.\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla trades a compelling plot for all-out conquest. The Vikings are Hel-bent on forcefully annexing the entirety of England, making it their home and taking over the land. The entire game is literally about expansion for the sake of being bigger. In that sense, this is the\u00a0quintessential Ubisoft game.To that end, each of England\u2019s distinct regions tells its own narrative. Eivor needs to curry favor or overthrow whoever reigns in each area in order to forge a Viking alliance.\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u00a0ends up feeling like a collection of mini-stories instead of a grand overarching epic. Certain threads pop up to string the whole thing together, but it\u2019s a largely disjointed plot and usually only serves the immediate cause.It\u2019s a problem because\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u00a0is a very large game and it often feels as though there\u2019s nothing irresistible enough to keep pulling you along. It extends beyond the critical path. There\u2019s a tangled web of Templars who need assassinating (exactly like Odyssey\u2018s Cult of Kosmos) but there\u2019s no fascinating side plot that\u2019ll leave you wondering who\u2019s at the head of it all. There\u2019s a thematic bent toward Norse mythology, but it\u2019s not apparent in the overworld; that stuff seems to be mostly confined to interactions with a single resident at your base camp.The combat \u2014 and there is a lot of it \u2014 is generally excellent. Valhalla\u00a0carries over the same combat system from Origins\u00a0and Odyssey, a straightforward iteration of the From Software-style light-and-heavy stamina-based attacking. It also continues the trend of outfitting the protagonist with a suite of abilities that hinge on an adrenaline meter. It\u2019s good that the fighting is fluid and fun because Ubisoft really quadrupled down on the number of frays you\u2019ll find yourself in.However, Ubisoft also scaled back almost everything else from the way it was represented in Odyssey.\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is much less of an RPG. Eivor doesn\u2019t feel as though he\u2019s given much autonomy over the story\u2019s direction, and the dialogue choice conversations fall short of making an impact more often than not. The gear system has been significantly stripped down, as the equipment Eivor receives is mostly found as semi-major rewards for exploration. In my view, saving us from juggling dozens of not-special piece of gear is nothing short of an improvement.Similarly, the leveling structure has been overhauled. Gone are the days of an overall character level, instead replaced by a total count of the number of skill points earned.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b529e074-f8c1-4694-b40f-e1a780fcdc38": {"__data__": {"id_": "b529e074-f8c1-4694-b40f-e1a780fcdc38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0fad11ce-8541-4b44-aead-5af0d3c46339", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "20b2e60168189f68161bdc0de03b3625574aadea6edc2be1e2078d8174e97219"}, "3": {"node_id": "c40d175d-37ee-4d22-abab-d89a78ff704e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e4a9385e67671bf85108d0f3d0ccd164578b52fa76a889bde2011bb28dc1e1f"}}, "hash": "233262654ec42ca8be4852ac81905937e0143c0d7bd8061a023bf10292691b70", "text": "Every time you fill the progress bar, Eivor is awarded two skill points to spend on a gigantic sprawling constellation map of perks.

The regions of England each have their own suggested power level but that\u2019s a soft gate to discourage tackling something that\u2019s meant for later-game stuff. Through the main campaign and moderate side-questing, you should be properly equipped to keep progressing without any major detours. Ubisoft also learned its lesson from Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey\u00a0and isn\u2019t selling an XP-boosting microtransaction this time. (Although, to be fair, I beat Odyssey\u00a0without that time-saver and always felt like the controversy was overblown.)Even though I wasn\u2019t especially enamored with the narrative design or the gameplay loop, I still found a lot to like throughout the rolling hills of England. Some of the more interesting parts of\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla are hiding among the many encounters in the open world. These world events are little two-minute distractions that tell a quick story. Finding a cat lady, and letting the felines chase away the mice in a field. Helping a man toss all his possessions off a cliff before he stuns you and throws himself\u00a0off the cliff. Sometimes it\u2019s simpler like going on a magic mushroom trip or destroying a cursed object. These interactions are when Valhalla\u00a0is comfortable getting weird for a little bit, and they\u2019re among the best this game has to offer.While\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u00a0falls into a rote routine, it isn\u2019t without its exclamation-point-worthy \u201cHoly shit\u201d moments. The story crescendos at certain junctures in ways that inject life into this long romp. Odin overseeing a late-game death sequence left me stunned. A mid-game battle atop a cliffside is among my favorite sequences in any Assassin\u2019s Creed.But I also found myself making excuses for\u00a0Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla\u00a0until I couldn\u2019t any longer. It mimics the Odyssey\u00a0formula but takes a step backward in almost every way. It sacrifices story for scale. It\u2019s designed to discourage stealth in favor of epic battles. It\u2019s true to the Viking experience, but it isn\u2019t true to the Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00a0experience. That\u2019s why it comes off feeling like the least essential game in the whole series. Impressive in some of its accomplishments, but inessential all the same.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive.

Login NowValhalla improves on Odyssey with more focused design, but not all battles are won.There was a time when open-world games often went with the bigger is better mentality. The size of the map was a pre-release selling point. Ubisoft embraced this mentality on several occasions, but quality will always win over quantity and, with Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, Ubisoft dialed back the former and poured more focus into the world and gameplay systems. It was a move that paid off repeatedly in their latest installment of the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise, but not all Viking warriors go to Valhalla.Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla kicks off with players meeting a young version of the main playable character, Eivor, whom they'll get to know better as they experience the game. Eivor is celebrating a Viking alliance with family and friends of the Raven Clan, but after things go south and Eivor\u2019s family is betrayed, the young Viking is attacked by a wolf. This is where players can choose between a male and female Eivor, or if they want Valhalla to decide based on current circumstances at any given time. The decision of whether to play as a female or male Eivor can be changed throughout the experience, which is a nice move by Ubisoft.Fast forward several years and players are in control of Eivor as an adult and must play through a prologue with some tutorial moments scattered in. The first hour showcases Eivor\u2019s Raven Clan life, plus systems like sailing, raiding, gear management and acquisition, the skill tree, and more. The story pushes forward during this time, with Eivor and her adopted brother, Sigurd, seeking revenge on the Viking that betrayed her family years ago. When this business is handled, Eivor, Sigurd, and the Raven Clan set sail for England to build a new settlement for their people.Valhalla really gets going once Eivor arrives in England and the game\u2019s systems start to open up. The clan\u2019s settlement is started, and players must secure resources to build additions and upgrade the living situation for everyone. Just about every part of Valhalla runs through the settlement, which gives it a real sense of home and helps keep all systems connected through this hub. Building Gunnar\u2019s Forge gives Eivor a place to enhance weapons and armor. The Trading Post is a spot to buy or sell items. The Barracks allows for the creation of a Jomsviking and crew management. Customizing the longship can be done in the Shipyard. There\u2019s even a Hunter\u2019s Hut for managing all the Legendary Animals, and a Hidden Ones Bureau to track the Order of the Ancients, a similar system to the cults from Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey. There are more buildings, several of which enhance the Feast buff. A Raven Clan Feast will give Eivor some boosted stats when out in the world.The settlement isn\u2019t just about function, though. As new buildings are added the aesthetic changes, giving the vibe of an established community that\u2019s thriving. There\u2019s a sense of accomplishment in building up the settlement, and because it\u2019s connected to so many other aspects of the game, it made me want to get out into the world and swing my axe. Ravensthorpe \u2013 my settlement \u2013 was a great launching point for my adventures, and it was never far from my mind.Once the settlement was established it was time to head out and gather supplies to build it up further. I hopped in my longboat, asked my crew to sing a song, and enjoyed the peacefulness as we sailed along England\u2019s narrow rivers looking for trouble. In this case, trouble meant a raid, an event in Valhalla where Eivor and her crew can attack a monastery, or several other types of settlements.It\u2019s a lot of fun to raid with a full Viking crew. It provides a unique gameplay experience to attack with a hoard of warriors. If a member of Eivor\u2019s crew falls, they can be revived, and they are needed to help force open doors and chests. Opening chests during a raid is how supplies are acquired to build the settlement. It\u2019s a frantic experience that serves as a reminder that Vikings aren\u2019t often friendly to strangers, although it stops short of encouraging players to kill unarmed priests.Raiding isn\u2019t the only activity, obviously. Most of my time was spent at least toying with the idea of pushing the story forward in Valhalla. I would go where the quests led, but the pull to explore was greater here than it was in Odyssey for me.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b125cf25-daae-412f-a926-18b3fd4ba1b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b125cf25-daae-412f-a926-18b3fd4ba1b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "c40d175d-37ee-4d22-abab-d89a78ff704e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e4a9385e67671bf85108d0f3d0ccd164578b52fa76a889bde2011bb28dc1e1f"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c1c2cb0-2215-4c82-8c06-cff157bb23ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf3b76e27f36d5176d693f2de37b9e4a211bf6615fa87f8def3c7baeac850845"}}, "hash": "4ed362d27cbee662d8e3de43c3f1ce35e5438c9d53e34b5c5211e88ab4563674", "text": "While the overall narrative in Valhalla was fine, it was never the primary force pushing my decisions on what to do next. The exception to this was a series of quests centered around Eivor's destiny, which I won\u2019t detail in the interest of avoiding spoilers. Generally, though, I was more focused on tracking down collectibles and exploring hidden areas.Valhalla is full of unique places to explore and fun things to do. There are random world events that can be hit or miss. A mini game called Dice or a sort of Viking rap battle known as Flyting are solid distractions. Legendary Animals are there to hunt, Zealots roam the land looking for a fight, and Flying Paper with cosmetic designs floating through the air can be snatched up using Eivor's parkour skills. Many more activities riddle the land and offer meaningful rewards, ensuring players won't get bored in Valhalla.\u00a0While the main story never really pulled me in, I quite enjoyed some of the characters and nods to Viking lore and Norse mythology. Some quests had me genuinely invested in spending time with the NPCs featured in them, and I think anyone with even a bit of interest in Norse mythology or current Viking pop culture will enjoy Valhalla.The real strength of Valhalla, however, is in the focus that has gone into the world and the systems within it. Valhalla feels much smaller than Odyssey, but there\u2019s less dead space. There\u2019s a good pace to moving around and finding places to explore. It\u2019s a breathtaking game on the highest PC settings \u2013 as is expected after Odyssey \u2013 and the entire world is enhanced by a beautiful soundtrack that never feels overpowering but always manages to complement the moment perfectly. While I wouldn\u2019t say Valhalla is on the same level as some open-world superstars, it\u2019s a massive upgrade over the hollowness that was felt in Odyssey.As I explored the world, I began to find gear and collectibles, unlocking abilities and skill points to craft my perfect Viking build. Every one of these systems works better in Valhalla than the last few Assassin\u2019s Creed games.There is much less gear in Valhalla than Odyssey, but that gear is far more meaningful. For starters, it all drops near the same base level, but the ability to enhance it and upgrade it is improved. Enhancing gear at a forge can improve its appearance, add slots for runes, and expand its potential to be upgraded. Upgrading gear or adding runes is done from the inventory. What this means is that gear found early in the game can be upgraded and maintained throughout the entire journey, instead of having to replace a weapon every five minutes when picking up a new one.Valhalla has also re-worked how skills and abilities are handled. Abilities, which are generally devastating moves used in battle, are now found by locating a Book of Knowledge in the world, which are often hidden away in caves and behind small puzzles. The skill tree now features both stat nodes and passive fighting moves, but not abilities. Players will now earn skill points in the world and, when spent in the skill tree, will improve their overall power, and allow them to take on more difficult challenges. The skill tree itself is presented as an astronomy map, and never once did I find it tedious to explore or build out my skills. The skill tree's fluidity in use is driven home by that fact that it's free to re-spec Evior\u2019s skills at any time, or even take back single nodes without penalty to spend those points on different upgrades.The gameplay core concerning the skill tree, weapons and armor, abilities, and power feels great. It pushes the player to get into the world and discover what\u2019s on offer, while at the same time allowing for wild build experimentation without punishment. The focus, not unlike in God of War, is on the world and the things to do in it, not on the grind.Unfortunately, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla has it issues, and some are more prominent than others. The big one for me was the game\u2019s performance on PC. According to Ubisoft\u2019s own specs guide, I could easily run the game on Enthusiast, but my experience was riddled with massive frame drops that at times rendered it unplayable. Ubisoft deployed a patch that seemed to have cleared up most \u2013 if not all \u2013 of the issues, but PC buyers should do their homework before diving in.I wouldn\u2019t call it a weak point, but the combat in Valhalla didn\u2019t do much for me. Dual wielding weapons is cool, as are some fighting moves and abilities, but combat was always just something I had to endure to push the story forward or allow me to explore the area for collectibles and loot.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c1c2cb0-2215-4c82-8c06-cff157bb23ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c1c2cb0-2215-4c82-8c06-cff157bb23ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b125cf25-daae-412f-a926-18b3fd4ba1b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ed362d27cbee662d8e3de43c3f1ce35e5438c9d53e34b5c5211e88ab4563674"}, "3": {"node_id": "2616a07b-5719-4626-bee5-c0aa7aaacda8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "91a1bc6310bd11c15a98818763ebb95ce2f794b4c57222b93579dc26fba02382"}}, "hash": "bf3b76e27f36d5176d693f2de37b9e4a211bf6615fa87f8def3c7baeac850845", "text": "It\u2019s not bad, and even has a few shining moments, but I also wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a step forward from Odyssey. The stealth gameplay remains strong and fun, but the nature of Viking warriors means there\u2019s less sneaking and more yelling than previous games.Rounding out my concerns are the instances where I was annoyed by the writing and voice acting. Early in the game I found a world event that was supposed to be funny in a sexual way, but played out as crude and poorly executed. I was also referred to as if I was male on several occasions, even though my Eivor was female. I enjoyed the performance by Cecilie Stenspil as the female Eivor, but some characters from the supporting cast were poorly portrayed. There\u2019s an art to putting humor into games that fit a darker tone, and I don\u2019t think Valhalla pulled it off with consistency here. Most of these issues were scattered about, but when they pop up it can pull a player from their immersion.Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla took a lot of great steps with its gameplay systems and fresh focus on a more robust open world. It hooked me on building my perfect Eivor through meaningful gear and by connecting the gameplay loop to character evolution in a fluid manner. The smaller world feels fuller thanks to better pacing and spacing. The plethora of unique and fun things to do while on the path generally tie into the Raven Clan\u2019s settlement, which helps to keep the experience fluid and connected most of the time.It\u2019s a shame that more care wasn\u2019t taken to remove some of the silliness in the writing or to improve on the hit or miss voice acting. The combat doesn't feel like it's taken a step forward and, in fact, combat in Odyssey felt tighter. I'm still worried that the PC performance issues aren't entirely behind me, but I suspect those will get addressed in future updates. Ubisoft is known for their fun open worlds, but it appears that experience and previous stumbles have seen them take big steps forward, making Valhalla one of their best Assassin's Creed games in recent memory.This review is based on a PC digital download code provided by Ubisoft.

Basically: Gosh, I like this game.It's a rare earnest turn for me, especially when I'm talking about open-world Ubisoft games. I try to find a fair-and-balanced way to talk about their hours of gameplay, and I respect the heck out of how their multi-studio teams slam together so many moving parts into a giant, playable romp. But personally, I can get bored with them\u2014same fetch quests, same ho-hum mechanics and checklists, year after year. After playing only a few hours of these games, I feel less like an adventurer and more like an errand boy or girl. None of their high-end rendering or historical references can change that feeling.Yet the Assassin's Creed series has been evolving into AC Valhalla's shape for some time, which we last saw from the character-driven surprise of 2018's AC Odyssey. This year's model is undeniably messy and imperfect, and it doesn't surpass Ghost of Tsushima as my favorite open-world romp so far this year.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b260672-09b5-4ce4-a47f-1472023cf674": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b260672-09b5-4ce4-a47f-1472023cf674", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb11ed2e-548e-4d23-9a31-641146fc7c96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "331edaf4d7e7e55348db79ba0515a760e609e7d70d8e13df94f55d38b00cc742"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b645586-73bc-42cc-bb12-51e39d9803a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1734e03cb5d9b0de41de51c5113cfbcfc11c4544daf0bbf589535199b1b44ed1"}}, "hash": "e3cc116cecec197832e904d90166bcafa952e79096c011a67104d31951e8e1c3", "text": "But it earns my recommendation for getting enough things right\u2014and doing so with more nuance than a phrase like \"a more RPG-like Assassin's Creed\" implies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed: Valhalla                                                \n\n\n\nFrom $50 at Amazon\n\n\nFrom $60 at Epic Games Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs.)\n\n\nWe're now roughly 7,000 games into the series, so if you don't know the basic drill, check any of our older AC reviews. In short: once again, you control a \"chosen one\" warrior in a real-world historical era, as dramatized for the sake of a video game. You're occasionally interrupted by a modern-day plot about researchers who dive into ancient warriors' DNA to wage war against a global, generations-deep conspiracy theory. This offers enough wacky plot hooks for anyone invested in the series. But mostly, you're back in time juggling a mix of open-world traversal, stealthy Spider-man crawls around massive historical sites, and all kinds of murder.In AC Valhalla, this formula lands in 9th-century England, where you're cast as Eivor, a high-ranking warrior in a band of Norse Vikings. This historical angle obviously means more beards, axes, and mentions of Odin than in any AC game before, which I can get down with, but the plot also hinges on the real-life immigration of Viking bands to begin new lives in other nations. This does something new for the AC series: it creates a home base. Eivor and her brother Sigurd have their hearts set on winning over England's \"unpacified\" kingdoms with equal parts diplomacy and pillaging, and both angles are helped by a central base for recruiting, resting, and gathering strength.                                            \nAdvertisement \n\n\nSure, growing your home settlement (named Ravensthorpe, after your clan's affinity for ravens) amounts to a glorified menu system. Gather enough in-game resources to build a fishery, for instance, and you get access to the game's fishing mini-game. Other buildings do everything from adding cosmetic options to unlocking quest lines. But unlike the home bases found in older entries like\u00a0Assassin's Creed II, this one has much more personality and unlocks brand-new gameplay features\u2014and makes me wish we didn't have to wait so long for Ubisoft to toy with the concept again.\u00a0It's nice to have a hub that always welcomes your hero with open arms, full of town-specific NPCs and past adventuring companions alike, and it fits into the game's expanded emphasis on narrative.Speaking of: if you were to think of AC Valhalla as a cable TV series'\u00a0single, lengthy season, you'd land somewhere between SyFy and AMC, and closer to the latter. Its reams of dialog and cast of voice actors deliver about as well as you might expect from over 30 hours of primary and secondary quests. It's perhaps easiest to compliment the game's narrative by way of elimination: one character, who appears in modern-day flash-forward sequences, is a travesty in terms of voice acting and dialog. I point that out because her misstep is the only glaring example I can think of in a cast of hundreds. Everyone else receives ample breathing room to establish traits, quirks, and motives, often broken out in mid-mission dialog passages or optional Q&A moments, and I appreciated how each in-game \"chapter\" of quests (usually two to three hours of adventuring) introduces and establishes at least one interesting character, if not a few.I am also compelled to praise the game's Viking-proud propensity for vulgar and sexual banter. Ubisoft's narrative team was given full rein to let men and women alike revel in the brutal realities of battling as a Viking and celebrating with booze, dance, and outright sexual thirst as appropriate (though always with words, not with awkward polygonal sex). AC Valhalla is a rousing success in terms of going rated-hard-R with its dialog without coming off as sophomoric or leaning on punching-down humor.Plus,\u00a0roughly every hour in this game, you'll be treated to a shouting match between two very angry people\u2014sometimes two blood-stained warriors, but more satisfyingly between a fighter and an impish noble\u2014that calls for a battle to the death.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b645586-73bc-42cc-bb12-51e39d9803a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b645586-73bc-42cc-bb12-51e39d9803a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b260672-09b5-4ce4-a47f-1472023cf674", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e3cc116cecec197832e904d90166bcafa952e79096c011a67104d31951e8e1c3"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9563a90-8005-4d0e-936a-38c7a0db7621", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ba080cf142b2f4d2f824334dc1e154b2656f6c2e9e6f15d42ed2f78ce3d389c"}}, "hash": "1734e03cb5d9b0de41de51c5113cfbcfc11c4544daf0bbf589535199b1b44ed1", "text": "The trash talk that plays out in these encounters is somehow always brutal, vulgar, and darkly hilarious. That this quality doesn't waver by the game's end is a testament to Ubisoft's Viking interpretation of \"yo momma\" fights.\u00a0After seeing reports about Ubisoft woes in terms of management and HR, I have to wonder if lower-rung Ubisoft developers used this game's pre-battle face-offs as a way to subtweet at their bosses. If so, I hope it felt as good for the devs to record these lines of dialog as it was for me to listen to them.That dialog is meaningless without an enjoyable game attached, and AC Valhalla gets\u00a0just enough right to keep you mashing away at a controller for dozens of hours. Much of that boils down to the usual AC open-world formula of quests, combat, puzzles, and mysteries, which Ubisoft has honed to a mostly steady sheen.\u00a0But I was surprised by the way one major tweak to the games played out: emergent missions.Your average on-foot march, horse ride, or longship charge through the Dark Ages will include some form of organic interruption. Ubisoft knows where you're likely to go in terms of valleys between massive mountains or direct paths between primary mission objectives, and it uses obvious visual and audio clues to nudge you toward passers-by in need of help. That's not anything new in this genre, but oftentimes, such an interruption dumps a new \"quest\" and list of objectives into your pause menu. Like, \"I'm on my way to install a puppet king, and you need me to go to\u00a0which five chapels to interrupt impure marriages, m'lord?!\"AC Valhalla\u00a0is careful not to interrupt your noble journey in such a manner. Instead, the people you meet along your path offer one-and-done requests, which you complete in the vicinity you find them in. As an example, if you run past a crowd of children while holding two axes and looking determined, those children will lose their minds\u2014you're the closest thing to Lebron\u00a0these kids are going to see on an average, disease-filled day\u2014and ask to play with you. Sometimes, this will turn into a makeshift game of hide-and-seek, which makes you flex your arsenal of sneaking moves. Other times, they'll want to pantomime war games, so you'll \"fight\" wooden dolls staged nearby.\"Nearby\" is an operative word: side-quest objectives, with very few exceptions, do not derail your primary progress or make you fast-travel to another part of the map. But Ubisoft is also mighty clever about what these tasks entail. With less distance to travel, the side-quest tasks you're given do\u00a0not light up as icons on your map or appear as vague clues in a text sidebar. Instead, you'll get a spoken prompt from the questgiver, then look around their vicinity to find and resolve the objective. Here's one of my favorite examples: early on, a young man says he seeks to engage in an honorable battle; your hero suggests that the man fight a woodland creature as a baby step into such battle-hardened glory, and he agrees. At this moment, you hear some wolves in the distance, and if you run to them, they make chase. The idea: lead the wolves to the man so he can battle them. (This is... not exactly how the quest plays out, but I'll leave its resolution unspoiled.)With these side quests, Ubisoft's quest developers break the mold of the average open-world quest\u2014and seem to openly have fun doing so. Primary objectives, after all, still require romping through massive cities, epic battles, and \"defeat three warlords before you continue\" kinds of sprawl and movement. You'll still check your map for icons and guidance to accomplish those, but since side quests are designed that much differently in AC Valhalla, they can be much quirkier by default\u2014and in ways that don't turn out annoying or tedious. Like the time I had to carry a guy's barrel of apples down a half-mile stretch of road and... nothing else happened. On one hand, this quest toyed with my expectation that carrying apples would devolve into, say, a fight against a bear (which it didn't). On the other, the narrative team took advantage of my rapt attention to host an odd conversation, beginning with a man's love for apple orchards and ending with a sweet conversation about differing religious beliefs.

Both shows stray from the traditional idea of Vikings that we were all once taught while growing up; There aren\u2019t any horned warriors in sight, they don\u2019t just run after innocent people, butchering them in the process. Instead, both show Viking culture in a different light, one that is more contemplative between their moments of bloodshed and conquest. Enter Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla.The game has had a rocky road to release, including the game\u2019s creative director being fired earlier this year, following multiple investigations into allegations of harassment and abuse at Ubisoft.You play as Eivor, who, along with his ally, Sigurd, sail to England in search of a new place to call home after having refused to bow to a new, young king in Norway. You arrive, set up a small community named Ravensthorpe, and are immediately swept up into the well-trodden ground of the Viking Expansion of England around 865 AD. This period of history has since been mythologised countless times, originally in The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and old Norse tale, The Saga of Ragnar\u2019s Sons. This period of history is especially messy, so it was the perfect place for the creators of Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla to introduce our band of Vikings into the mix.In true Assassin\u2019s Creed-style, you\u2019ll get to know and meet famous figures like Ivarr the Boneless and Ubba Ragnarsson, after clearing up the mess left by the Great Summer Army. The plot sees you battle with yourself as you meet the challenges of leading a new settlement, and controlling the balances of power across the kingdoms of England. These stories are dotted throughout England, where you\u2019ll interact with a number of kingmakers, as the scales of power begin to dramatically shift.This is done incredibly effectively, with Eivor pledging to different realms across England, which sets you on different story arcs to tip power in your favour in those areas. You do start to connect with the names and faces in the game, which are equally interspersed with quieter, character-driven moments in between the heavy politics and action setpieces. There are also revelations to be found in the game that left me completely slack-jawed, but I really don\u2019t want to spoil that for you.It\u2019s a compelling story, with twists and turns through the narrative to keep you hooked, and stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the likes of The Last Kingdom and Vikings. Though, your player-character Eivor is just your run-of-the mill \u2018brute with a heart of gold\u2019, but as you play, the more Eivor grows and develops into a compelling protagonist, with some shocking moments that we\u2019re not about to spill the beans on.Unfortunately, the near-enough incomprehensible \u201creal world\u201d plot of the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise continues. Luckily, those moments are still few and far between, but equally bring absolutely nothing to the table when it comes to my enjoyment of the game. At this point, does anyone still really care about it when there\u2019s a whole, much more engaging world to explore and think about? \n \nMake no mistake, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is enormous, and very much follows the traditional Ubisoft mould of littering the map with things to do and places to explore until your legs fall off, including the trademark Assassin\u2019s Creed towers. However, some efforts have been made to change up the status quo, with small environmental puzzles, \u2018mysteries\u2019 in the world that break up exploration, and quests back at Ravensthorpe that let you get a little closer to your crew.There are more emergent events that you can stumble upon, too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d62fd027-2366-4296-9e86-b05c03da4385": {"__data__": {"id_": "d62fd027-2366-4296-9e86-b05c03da4385", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9563a90-8005-4d0e-936a-38c7a0db7621", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ba080cf142b2f4d2f824334dc1e154b2656f6c2e9e6f15d42ed2f78ce3d389c"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3a5b959-9d27-44a1-b503-60532a09fea2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4fab41ff8cfa54a0a7da268330704ec3f8835184d366df23890e7e91ec939e56"}}, "hash": "950bb117b6274a430a0c6c67e0fd5812950b8ed2e9aa5c430f69412115f90c87", "text": "One of my favourites early-on in the game was about giving a soldier who had just returned home a wash, after he stank out the house, claiming that being covered in poo, and shooting poo-covered arrows gave him an edge in battle.

It would have been nice to be a bit more grounded in the world of Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, with a stronger focus on the stories of the ordinary folk who live there, but there have been clear efforts made so you get an idea of what life might be like in Anglo-Saxon England.During the course of the Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, you\u2019ll hear a distinct mood encompassing the journey, this is in-part due to Ubisoft bringing stalwart musician Einar Selvik on board, ex-drummer of the seminal black metal band Gorgoroth, and a founding member of Wardruna, who frequently have songs featured on the Vikings History Channel show. It\u2019s exceptional work, and only deepens the immersion you feel at key moments throughout the game.When it comes to combat and enemy encampments, Valhalla does manage to break the cycle of the traditional stealth-infiltration loop that was seemingly copied and pasted in every inch of Odyssey\u2019s map. Instead, we have \u2018Raids\u2019, which are sieges on settlements or encampments that you\u2019re able to activate when you\u2019re in the area. When you initiate a raid in an appropriate area, you\u2019re able to tackle all the enemies in that encampment head-on, with a band of raiders that you can recruit and select by your side. The raid ends when you\u2019ve collected three pieces of loot that are scattered in the encampment. \n \nFor the most part, these are all straight-up melees with large groups of enemies, with nary a hint of strategy behind it. The same mechanic is carried forward in certain moments in the main story, where you\u2019re able to make use of a battering ram. It would have been nice to see other elements make up raids in the game, but the sheer feeling that you get from it is exhilarating. Your reward for completing raids are precious resources to help you upgrade your encampment at Ravensthorpe, and you\u2019ll be needing to do them fairly often. But it never really gets very old, thanks, in part, to the strength of the combat in Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla.You\u2019re able to fight in a few different styles, choosing from stealth, ranged and melee approaches, with appropriate skill tree upgrades as you go on, like every other AAA game made in 2020. However, I found the most fun pretty much ignoring any semblance of subtlety or stealth, and attacking-head on with two axes in hand, making quick work of enemies along the way. With a range of different weapons and abilities that you can find while exploring the world, the options you have available to you are impressive. While it\u2019s certainly not a Dark Souls-level of slowness to combat, there is a deliberate pace and balance to your swings, arrows and skills, which are all managed with stamina and adrenaline meters, making it feel weighty, deliberate and satisfying.Gear and skills are tied to combat ability, with gear progression specifically taking a bit of a backseat this time around, with armour and weapons being significantly scarcer than they were in previous games. This essentially forces you into spending your resources into levelling up gear at local blacksmiths, getting you invested early with your character build. This is definitely a welcome change in comparison to the dull, loot-treadmill approach of previous games.It takes a while to really warm up to Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, and 15-20 hours in I wasn\u2019t quite as keen on it as I am now; but that\u2019s thanks to the game holding up, and actually giving you more as you play, in terms of plot, world, activities and getting to uncover the mysteries hidden deep within the game. It breaks some of the chains that the series was shackled in when it comes to design, while also boldly owning its own identity, too. It might not be The Witcher: Wild Hunt, or specifically do anything that breaks the wheel when it comes to open-world game design, but Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla gets you invested.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3a5b959-9d27-44a1-b503-60532a09fea2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3a5b959-9d27-44a1-b503-60532a09fea2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b49fcd8-5910-4ddd-86da-0a080718fa43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e09fe7d0a8b621dfcbcdc83a43eecb914367aeff2c157b70e81a85288b8907c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "d62fd027-2366-4296-9e86-b05c03da4385", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "950bb117b6274a430a0c6c67e0fd5812950b8ed2e9aa5c430f69412115f90c87"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7fe7de1-77e6-429d-afa7-d07ce17c2b6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8bb47899b3582785f5f4d93dc4ec7570060941a792ce7ce0fa34d1ed2e18b138"}}, "hash": "4fab41ff8cfa54a0a7da268330704ec3f8835184d366df23890e7e91ec939e56", "text": "It's a slow-burn that takes its time to show you its true colours before flourishing into a rewarding, meaty game that\u2019ll keep you engaged over the winter months.Assassin\u2019s Creed: Valhalla comes to PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS4 and Stadia on November 10, and to PS5 on November 19.
