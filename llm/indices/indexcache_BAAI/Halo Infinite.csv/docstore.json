No. Not in terms of gunplay, at least - of gunfeel, of the constant cycling between empowerment and disempowerment and the much-harder-than-it-looks balance that so many shooters yearn for, between that immediate, crunchy, punch-feedback satisfaction and Halo's famously slower, big-brain strategy. No there is not. I've spent weeks picking at this game, prodding it and poking it and peeling away at the edges to try and uncover some kind of flaw, and I can't. As far as the moment-to-moment of multiplayer shooters goes, it's immaculate. This, genuinely, is as good as it gets. The only problem is the front end - the meta-game or the UX or whatever that kind of menu-based wrapping of a game is called these days. There are some quirks there, some weird choices that threaten to muddy the otherwise pure waters of Halo Infinite's \"golden triangle\". But thankfully in most cases you can - and probably should - ignore them.If you're unfamiliar, Halo Infinite's multiplayer and its campaign are effectively separate games. The Halo Infinite campaign, which Eurogamer's Wesley Yin-Poole mostly loved, is a paid-for thing that stands on its own (although there are a few collectibles that unlock cosmetics in the multiplayer, presumably to help encourage players to try both). The multiplayer is free and separate. By modern standards, a year and a half after Call of Duty Warzone split off from the annual CoD and several after Fortnite transcended Fortnite, that's nothing new. But it's a fairly radical first for Halo, a series that has for much of its later life been defined by its conservatism. It's a theme that runs through Halo Infinite: a cascade of little-firsts, mini-revolutions, tiny, barely perceptible tweaks and changes. The thing they all share is their un-Haloness, the fact that five, ten years ago the Chief wouldn't be seen dead with any one of them, but that now feel like they've been there all along.Maybe the best example is the Assault Rifle, Master Chief's trusty default weapon that once seemed to barely tickle enemies with its rounds of fluttering eyelashes, but now positively bellows down at them, each bullet a hammer blow from the gods. Evolving sound design is one thing - an area that's been reliably improving with each 343 Industries Halo but reaches a thunderous, superlative pitch here in Infinite - but the effect, intentional or not, is an acute sense of viability. For so long the AR has been the designated swap-out fodder in Halo, whichever part of the game you're playing, but the sense of crunching feedback in Infinite makes me oddly reluctant. The actual damage, as far as I know - the meat and bones of how many bullets it fires, how fast they fire and how hard they hit - is more or less the same as ever, but combined with a new, tasty little red cross to confirm the kill, a new, CoD-like ft-ft-ft when you're landing a hit, and the left-trigger \"smart scope\" controversially added in Halo 5, and you get a kind of magic placebo buff. Suddenly I'm good - weirdly good - at using a weapon that I don't think has changed.It's a good example of what Halo Infinite really is, too, because it's so obviously the original Call of Duty: Modern Warfare that inspired these tweaks - or at least kicked off the decade-plus of shooter trends that since inspired them in Halo Infinite - and it was that Modern Warfare, releasing about 40 days after the series-peak Halo 3, that threatened to undermine everything Halo was. Halo's allergy to change felt like a direct, if involuntary response, a stubborn digging-in and doubling-down on what \"real Halo\" ought to be that 343 has clearly struggled under since taking over from Bungie (and you can't blame the team for that catch-22: stick with old Halo and get left behind, or change too much and be accused of not getting it?). Where Halo was wincing at the thought of a continuous sprint button, Titanfall was double-jumping off walls. By the time Halo got that ADS-that-still-isn't-actually-ADS off the clickable Right Stick and onto LT, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was rattling the cages of every shooter with a hundred-player battle royale.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da353da6-884f-446c-9c3a-bf80314fbc51": {"__data__": {"id_": "da353da6-884f-446c-9c3a-bf80314fbc51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a2c9464-686a-45fd-97aa-8b46cb247723", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fda7f20f0ec84399b1753c2c2c49cbb70d8861cb534f7519cf66aabfe3e2b72"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba3cd924-bad0-4faa-b89d-ea4ee37507e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "71e62092130906686fcd28eed04acb6e4963e2b07f0ee832bb9622c53a6722cc"}}, "hash": "4e0e5cc88675aaf5c871e0ec04e4be8c1834acc78f9bfeff2f1ab82a3643aac7", "text": "Now, a poetic justice: Halo's stubbornness sank it, but that time out of the limelight, out of the common mind and frankly out of the entire conversation on what first-person shooters are has allowed it to perform a kind of dramatic re-emergence, Infinite stepping out onto the scene like some third act rom-com glow up. 343 has been stuck in what looked like a doomed existential crisis, every new game stirring us all up into a debate about Halo's \"essence\" and \"purpose\" and what makes Halo Halo - what we even liked about in the first place and whether it can even work now. Suddenly the series was this playable Ship of Theseus; how many old weapons can you swap out for new ones before you've built a whole new series? With Infinite, that stubbornness seems to have finally come around to work in Halo's favour,  because now those little changes feel so big, so new, and the many big things that don't change from the formula suddenly feel like bold affirmations, instead of fearful resistance. Halo is not a hip-fire game because it's scared to compromise, or worried that it might be seen as \"copying\" the dominant Call of Duty, seen as being forced to change by another game's success, or its new studio seen as too duty-bound to the Bungie formula. Halo is a hip-fire game because hip-fire is awesome, because it makes you feel a kind of mythic power in your nonchalance, because timidly bringing your rifle up to look down the sights is the feeble little Jackal's method, and you are a Spartan. Halo is finally able to stand up and make that affirmation because it's realised, as a series, that it can do whatever the hell it wants.After that, the rest of Halo Infinite feels like a celebration - this is a game that's discovered its purpose anew, and its purpose, apparently, is to simply make everything feel absolutely incredible. In every interaction it's like the fog has been cleared, the line between brain and game has been shortened. In many ways Halo Infinite is the perfect Halo remaster: this is not actually what classic Halo felt like, but it's what you think it felt like, 15 years on. Ghosts, for instance, feel a little faster, more agile, less drifty and more prone to flipping onto their domed, crabby little backs if you get a corner wrong. Highlights - actual highlights I've become addicted to clipping, to share with anyone who'll watch - seem to happen once a minute. Toys are everywhere, the spread of power weapons extra generous along with the added boon of those lovely glowing blue containers that just beg to be hoiked at a cluster of enemies, ideally while you waft above them, catapulted off a launch pad. Everything is so physical, so kinetic. Everything connects. Drive this off there then grapple hook that. Jump here, throw this, skewer that enemy and wallop the other when you land. Half the fun of finally nabbing a flying vehicle is to stop yourself and just watch, for a second, while the uniquely scientific chaos unfolds below, rockets and Mongeese and cadavers whirling about some objective like the planets of an orrery. The other half is joining in.It really is magic - the magic of playing physics in motion - and so it's a crying shame when the small annoyances of that overlayer creep in. The glaring one, that is actually capable of affecting the playing of the game, is the lack of Slayer playlist. Right now you can only choose between small-sided 4v4 matches or Big Team Battle (or ranked), but within those two playlists it's just a random chance that dictates what mode you get. The result is some players, clearly and actually quite understandably, playing to rack up kills in modes that require proper cohesive work towards an objective, along with lots of matching, \"go play Slayer\" remarks dropped in the in-game chat. It's just one split that it really needs, between objective and non-objective playlists, and while Halo Infinite will have likely had a good few technical hiccups spurring that year-long delay there must surely be a simple, workable solution here - not least because it's a front-end choice that impacts the playing experience, and one the series has had for so long before now.\"What Halo Infinite chooses to value is a heavenly satisfaction that makes this series' old, arcadey soul feel new.\"There's also a bit of a thinness to it, generally. There are just a handful of maps at launch - they are brilliant, at least - and again a bit of a paucity of modes within the two playlists.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba3cd924-bad0-4faa-b89d-ea4ee37507e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba3cd924-bad0-4faa-b89d-ea4ee37507e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "da353da6-884f-446c-9c3a-bf80314fbc51", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e0e5cc88675aaf5c871e0ec04e4be8c1834acc78f9bfeff2f1ab82a3643aac7"}, "3": {"node_id": "efa0d227-d4fa-4afd-b223-655b256225bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "46c195eb33a25003b0a0d4d863a30e2043f71c0e7a5c54d16b2c31ad8524573f"}}, "hash": "71e62092130906686fcd28eed04acb6e4963e2b07f0ee832bb9622c53a6722cc", "text": "I miss the weird stuff, the 4am rounds of Grifball, shotty snipers, and the oddly spooky Infection. Others will surely miss the PvE Firefight. I miss the Forge World maps, something I never thought I'd say, just because of the variety their eerie vibe peppered into the game. I definitely miss SWAT. Some of these are coming, in some form, some time after launch, but according to one 343 developer's tweet that won't be before the end of the year. That's a theme that lingers with Halo Infinite, across the campaign as well as the single-player, and it's a shame after such a hefty delay to still feel a yearning for the things that are still to come. The choice to play an objective mode or not should unequivocally be there at launch.Finally, there is a battle pass. This is how Halo Infinite is paid for - it is completely free to play itself, and nothing in the pass impacts the way the game plays - and so it's a necessary evil. There are issues with progression; it is slow and boring, even after tweaks during the beta, but the problem with battle passes isn't the rate at which you can get through them so much as the fact they create a compulsion to get through them at all. Engagement bait is a grim practice and one that's everywhere, Halo Infinite far from an exception and far from the worst example - but it's still grim. Creating a compulsion to play more through added objectives treats gameplay as a means to an end, forging a kind of quasi-addiction and shifting the value and the sense of reward away from the act of gameplay itself. It sucks.At the same time, you can just ignore it. This is what I've done and what I expect I'll always do, because playing this game feels incredible (and because I just want to paint my Spartan a kind of burnt orange, which is already possible without the pass). This is the newly rediscovered goal of Halo, and this again is the point with Halo Infinite. You are free to simply not care about external influences, to not care about the impression of \"giving in\" that might have once come when Halo adds a sprint, when gameplay feels faster (regardless of whether it demonstrably is), when there's newly heightened urge to pelt back into the action after death, and when vehicles and power weapons drop from the sky like the killstreaks of CoD or loot crates of a battle royale. What matters is you can choose to care about what you value. What Halo Infinite chooses to value is a heavenly satisfaction that makes this series' old, arcadey soul feel new. What I choose to value is... also that.\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nChris Tapsell\n\n          Deputy Editor\n        Chris Tapsell is Eurogamer's Deputy Editor and most decorated Football Manager.

It could have gone horribly wrong. Based on how the campaign looked just a year ago, I thought it had done. But I'm delighted to report 343 stuck the landing - like Master Chief slamming into the new and mysterious Halo ring upon which Infinite is set.I thought Halo 5: Guardians did a lot right, but I get the feeling 343 has tried to leave it behind as it plots out Halo's future. Infinite is a spiritual reboot of the franchise, set chronologically after the controversial events of Halo 5, but taking inspiration from Bungie's seminal Halo: Combat Evolved not just in gameplay feel, but in tone, aesthetic and setting.It's initially bemusing, too - and I say that as a Halo fan who's read one of the books. Infinite starts with Master Chief floating in space near Zeta Halo, one of the oldest and most mysterious Halo rings in the galaxy. A pilot drags him into a Pelican and dusts him off. \"Status report,\" Master Chief asks in typical matter-of-fact fashion. Infinite spends the next 15 or so hours procrastinating before it makes a serious attempt at providing an answer.Six months have passed since a war took place on Zeta Halo between the UNSC and the Banished, an offshoot of the Covenant alien force led by a particularly grumpy War Chief called Escharum. It's not clear what happened, why it happened or who it happened to, but Master Chief ends up fighting his way off a Banished spaceship and landing on Zeta Halo to spark a fightback.Halo fans will feel right at home here - this setup mimics Halo: Combat Evolved's iconic opening handful of missions. Silent Cartographer, one of the greatest first-person shooter missions ever created, courses through Halo Infinite's veins - and it's all the better for it.Master Chief's initial mission is to retrieve The Weapon, an AI that was built to defeat Cortana and then, once done, delete herself. For some reason this didn't happen.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "589a865c-ac2f-45c6-91a9-ef04f3220a54": {"__data__": {"id_": "589a865c-ac2f-45c6-91a9-ef04f3220a54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "efa0d227-d4fa-4afd-b223-655b256225bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "46c195eb33a25003b0a0d4d863a30e2043f71c0e7a5c54d16b2c31ad8524573f"}, "3": {"node_id": "596705a0-41bd-44ad-aec3-dc9c985ee987", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "770e995ea18f2dfabe4c819103f2641565f433eab83589f8977ec392bb31407d"}}, "hash": "76a5da82a9747d714c0ac2a7b5d8d8323bd3157c640583b36d6c05228acc49d8", "text": "For some reason this didn't happen. The Weapon becomes Master Chief's companion, a relentlessly chirpy voice in his head and, quite often, holographic projection that pops out from his hand to make doors open.It's not long before Halo Infinite settles down and you understand the kind of game it is. You are placed on the broken bit of Zeta Halo, which is riddled with Banished who are up to no good. Comparisons to Ubisoft open-worlds are only valid in so much as there are objectives on the map to hoover up, but Halo Infinite's play space is nowhere near as big as those you get from an Assassin's Creed or a Far Cry. And it's not truly open-world, either. The various \"islands\" of the ring are initially unconnected - there's an element of Metroid Prime here in that as you complete key story missions you unlock new abilities and new areas to explore. Eventually the entire world becomes yours to traverse as you see fit, but the journey there isn't quite Breath of the Wild.I think this is a good decision, given Halo Infinite's heavy reliance on its wonderful combat. Oh, the combat! This is as good as Halo's combat has been since Bungie left the franchise behind for Destiny. It's easily 343's best work, a back to basics approach to fighting aliens that leans heavily on delightful physics systems colliding with each other. The vast majority of the weapons feel and sound spot on, and have their place within the sandbox (even the much-maligned Disrupter has its use). Master Chief's iconic assault rifle peppers enemies with bullets like a drummer rasping a snare. There are even a few fan-favourite weapons that make a welcome return from previous entries in the series.The best way to explain Infinite's fighting is to say it makes you feel like you're a super soldier running amok. The combat bowls are spread out across the map, so you can pick and choose your battles and how you approach them, but Halo Infinite is at its best when Master Chief leaps into the fray, against insurmountable odds, and cleans house. Halo Infinite, brilliantly, reassuringly, satisfyingly, makes combat work on this brave new world. What was it Rorschach said in The Watchmen? \"You're locked up in here with me.\" It's like that, but across the broken shards of a Halo ring instead of a prison.343 has, smartly I think, littered Zeta Halo with power coils of varying potency. These exploding barrels are freely available for you to shoot, lob and generally have a blast with. Chuck one into a group of Banished and watch the sparks fly. Infinite has a lot of sparks! It makes no sense that these coils should even be here. If I were the Banished and I knew Master Chief was out to get me, the first thing I'd do is hide all the things that he's likely to use to blow me up - perhaps even accidentally.There's a purple coil over there - I'm going to pull it towards me like Scorpion doing his famous \"Get over here!\" move. Yep, Master Chief has a fun new toy: the grappleshot. This expertly executed plaything turns Master Chief into a tanky Spider-Man. Pull yourself to enemies, pull guns towards you, fling yourself into the air then fire a rocket at your victims. Even better, grapple onto a vehicle, boot out its pilot and devastate the combat bowl below. Leap out before the vehicle blows up and grapple towards a Brute for a melee finisher to the face. It's the heroic death Craig deserves.The grappleshot is so good it's easy to forget Master Chief's other new toys, such as the thruster and the threat sensor. They're always available at the push of a couple of buttons, but I hardly ever use them because the grappleshot feels so essential and, simply, it's more fun. And fun is the name of the game.It's a good thing, too, because the campaign can at times feel repetitive and, during its final third, a bit of a slog. There are a few things contributing to this, I think. The first is that Halo Infinite is confined to just the one biome. That northwestern United States environment, classic Halo of course with its trees and streams and hills and cliffs, is only broken up by Forerunner-built interiors you visit during main quest missions (got to love those Forerunner doors, though!). 343 adds variety with bespoke Banished outposts, but these play spaces don't set the world on fire. Infinite is set on and inside a Halo ring and you get what you'd expect from that.Then there are pacing problems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "596705a0-41bd-44ad-aec3-dc9c985ee987": {"__data__": {"id_": "596705a0-41bd-44ad-aec3-dc9c985ee987", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "589a865c-ac2f-45c6-91a9-ef04f3220a54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76a5da82a9747d714c0ac2a7b5d8d8323bd3157c640583b36d6c05228acc49d8"}, "3": {"node_id": "1cb48eb1-4f73-4243-acf7-97b217a27222", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c78323ba8e05459a2465b10c4f63dfa090a3032665c6540366a9a4f55ae3b3a"}}, "hash": "770e995ea18f2dfabe4c819103f2641565f433eab83589f8977ec392bb31407d", "text": "Halo Infinite is packed with side missions and collectibles that unlock weapon variants, new vehicles you can spawn and more powerful abilities (you can improve that wonderful grappleshot, for example), but they're not interesting or exciting beyond the thrill of gameplay. Rescue a group of UNSC prisoners, liberate a Forward Operating Base (FOB), kill a high-value Banished target - these optional objectives are a tad one-note.Main quest missions offer a more traditional, linear Halo campaign experience with some brilliant set-pieces, but these are mostly set within interior locations. And some of the main quests feel like busywork. There's a lot of 'go here and do this' to Infinite's campaign. At one point you have to repeat the same objective four times inside four identical Forerunner structures placed across the map. 343 hasn't quite managed to create a truly memorable Halo mission outside on the open world, which is a shame.The story is complete nonsense, too. Alas, such is Halo! Ancient aliens and rampant AIs who whisper in riddles while Master Chief hardly talks at all. Escharum, the big bad guy, periodically turns up in ginormous holographic form to taunt Master Chief like a bulging WWE wrestler trash-talking before a bout. That Master Chief never responds is kind of hilarious. There's a cutscene where one key character bares their soul to Master Chief. All Master Chief does during this \"conversation\" is keep schtum, but that silence is enough to spark a dramatic confession. I'm kind of impressed - Master Chief would make a good journalist, I think.And Infinite has that thing some games have where everything the story has you do is basically the work of an engineer. Master Chief brings loads of guns to the job, as is his want, but you do spend hours listening to The Weapon tell you she doesn't quite understand why a thing is doing the thing it's doing, but you should definitely blow it up anyway while she works to sort it out. Master Chief always agrees without saying a word, and off you trot, plasma grenade in hand. Things certainly do happen in the story, but I wasn't that bothered by any of it beyond the challenge it posed, the spectacle of my surroundings and the thrill of the fight. I found the ending an exercise in frustration, failing to properly answer the burning questions Infinite poses, instead opting to set up what I suspect will be story DLC coming later. This Halo is Infinite, remember.The key question I had about Halo Infinite's campaign after playing it for preview was whether it had the kind of spark needed to justify the shift to sort-of open-world. Why explore if there's nothing interesting to be found? Thankfully, I think that spark is in Halo Infinite, although you have to work to find it.On a few occasions, amid the hoovering up of map icons, I stumbled across unmarked areas of interest: caves and Forerunner rooms that warranted a closer look. 343 has dabbled in environmental storytelling in some of these spaces, and they made me wonder what else the ring might have to offer. I won't spoil any of these here - the magic is in their discovery. But the point is they are there. And there are a few hidden surprises for Halo fans, too, which is lovely.This is the main reason why I jumped straight back into Halo Infinite's campaign after I finished it.

Six years after the sour note of Halo 5, 343 Industries has dusted off the Master Chief's armour for a throwback to Bungie's original, pointedly nostalgic for a time when Halo was just a big green man, his blue holographic girlfriend and a wide open ring full of possibilities to explore.\u00a0What this results in is a game that could be a true return to form for Master Chief\u2014but I'm just not convinced Halo really needed to be an open world.Let's make one thing clear though: this is some damn fine Halo. Having played Halo 3 with the lads every weekend for the last year, Infinite comes as a breath of fresh air. Running and gunning in Halo has never felt this good, Master Chief moving with a real heft even as he slides and mantles his way across ancient alien amphitheatres.\u00a0Halo Infinite's multiplayer gave us a taste of this, launching a month ahead of the story proper. But where the game's arsenal feels a little flat in team slayer, the campaign helps even the flimsiest weapons shine thanks to a menagerie of alien baddies with unique behaviours. Weapon types have never felt more important, especially on harder difficulties (I played through on Heroic), and juggling between bursting shields with plasma, busting skulls with kinetic and stunning foes with shock weapons becomes crucial. I hate the Pulse Carbine in multiplayer, but in the campaign it became a brutally efficient Elite-slaying machine.It helps that every weapon feels great, snapping and popping and busting with satisfying sounds. Infinite's firefights feel electric, hectic, a constant grab-bag of finding the next best tool (even if that means tossing a nearby plasma barrel at a pack of Grunts).None of this comes close to the sheer absolute thrill of the grappling hook. Infinite immediately hands you a Titanfall 2-style length of rope with which to fling yourself around Zeta Halo with. At first you're pulling yourself out of enemy fire and grappling vehicles, but a few upgrades will turn it into a deadly electric wire that shocks unshielded baddies and lets you slam-dunk entire packs of foes with a tap of the melee button.\u00a0This does come at the cost of making the rest of the equipment feel a little redundant, mind. Changing equipment on the fly is a hassle and\u2014besides using the threat sensor to reveal cloaked Elites\u2014you're always best served with the utility (and shockingly-fast cooldown) of a hooked rope.I'm only looking at Infinite's campaign in this review, but that's only because we've already been playing multiplayer with the rest of you for the past month. It's incredible stuff, but one that's hindered by limited modes, somewhat flat weapon balancing, and a progression system that straight-up sucks. The game's first limited-time mode only exacerbated problems with an uninspiring cosmetics pool and frustrating challenges, and while 343 says it's listening, these are errors free-to-play games learned not to make years ago.\u00a0Playing with my regular Halo buds online is still a blast, but I'm quickly burning out of Infinite's arenas.That grapple is also essential for exploring Halo Infinite's open world. Introduced after two more traditionally linear missions, Infinite introduces you to the open-ish plains of Zeta Halo. But while your AI sidekick (more on her later) immediately floods your map screen with icons, don't be fooled. This isn't Far Cry: Ringworld\u2014in fact, you'll find the open world to be surprisingly small.Instead, these activities feel more like diversions between main story missions. While heading to your next plot beat you might find a squad of marines to rescue or an FOB (bases from which to fast travel and summon weapons and vehicles) to capture. They're fun, but incidental\u2014and while the larger strongholds provide a more structured, traditionally 'Halo' challenge (shut down a refinery, demolish a weapons cache, punch through a blockade), I rarely felt the pull to break off from the main path to devote time to them.See, Halo doesn't lend itself well to a drip-feed of unlocks. Main story missions are tightly controlled and rarely let you just rock up with a tank. Powerful weapon variations can be acquired by taking down high-value targets in the open world, but levels are constantly throwing completely different challenges in your face. Why cling onto a long-range Sidekick variant when a mission just tossed you into a pit of beefed-up Elites?There's perhaps one mission that makes use of the open world structure, a mid-game level that tasks you with crossing kilometres of space to infiltrate Forerunner beacons fiercely held by Banished forces.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a327c49-5096-4e66-8fb8-65e0d5d8227e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a327c49-5096-4e66-8fb8-65e0d5d8227e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "78420e43-8e4d-4a46-80a8-279f3072a801", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "caff8b96a61e8f581c8937219dcc8e7ff72fefbd0078154c3141a92a9af30cb7"}, "3": {"node_id": "1443bcd1-64a2-467d-be30-41b00fc9c638", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "82434b808190bb656f79285ad1a339e3bd65453c87a38b91d1cc75f103dbd9f2"}}, "hash": "2fce5b415f986b56f4d8287b49a82c27e1645b3eb60cefed616f6b118c050e71", "text": "It's here where all those toys you may have unlocked can finally come into play\u2014one final effort at an open world Halo, before Infinite sort of gives up on pretending to be an open world entirely in its final hours.But Halo Infinite is still an open world, and even when it guns back into a more traditional pace in the latter half, it can't escape that structure. The Forerunners must have loved their trip to Seattle, because Infinite's world is all minor variations on the same Pacific Northwest environment. Because the story needs to take place within this small chunk of Zeta Halo (less an expansive ringworld and more a modest national park), missions can't break off into desert vistas, frozen valleys or dense urban warzones. Enter a mission, and you're guaranteed it'll be some combination of pine forests and pristine Forerunner structures.Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful forest. Infinite is a gorgeous game, omitting the overdesigned characters and environments of 343's previous games to create a well-considered evolution of Bungie's visuals. Forests are thriving with wildlife, grass sways in the breeze, and Forerunner structures feel suitably imposing. That ring on the horizon is physical, interacting with the sun and casting long shadows across itself.But that familiarity robs missions of a unique identity, and after finishing the game the only mission that stands in my memory is a late-game level in a particularly fun Banished facility. The open world's lush forests, valleys and marine-rescue setup may strongly evoke Halo (the mission) from Halo (the 2001 series debut), but none of the main missions stand up against the timeless design of The Silent Cartographer, or even Halo 3's less-fondly remembered meat labyrinth, Cortana.In the moment, level and encounter design is great. 343 is so careful to make sure fights never feel overly familiar, always throwing new pain points into the mix. There are even moments that call back to highs from earlier games\u2014fending off Sentinels from a painfully slow gondola, tearing down valleys in a Scorpion tank. But there's nothing as spectacular as the time Halo 3 dropped two building-sized Scarabs on top of you and told you to figure it out.Instead, Infinite has boss fights. These mostly see you kiting the boss around a small arena figuring out the best way to crack their shields before finishing them off, a more bullet-spongey variation on Halo's core loop with more punishing attack patterns. They're fine, if a bit overlong. But there's a special place in hell for a pair of Brutes you're forced to face in an open ditch\u2014one riding a souped-up Chopper while the other nukes you with artillery fire, summoning extra baddies when either is defeated.\u00a0Think Ornstein and Smaugh with grenade launchers, and you'll understand my pain.But the biggest frustration is that, for as much as Infinite has been earmarked as a throwback to the series' roots, 343 can't shed the baggage the series' lore has accrued over the last 20 years. It's frustrating because at the root of the game is the relationship between Chief, the UNSC Pilot who rescues him at the game's opening, and The Weapon\u2014an AI modelled after Cortana after Cortana went all galactic dictator-god at the end of Halo 5.Halo Infinite has been running fairly flawlessly on my 2070, and while I've had one or two sudden crashes on multiplayer, the same can't be said of the campaign which remained rock-solid throughout. If you're looking to squeeze a little extra juice out of the game, however, Infinite has a fairly robust set of graphics options, outlining how much VRAM each setting will demand of your hardware.Special mention has to be made of Infinite's suite of accessibility tools. On top of fully rebindable controls, there are dozens of settings for controlling everything from sensory effects like speed lines and screen shake, multiplayer team colours, the size and appearance of subtitles, and text-to-speech options both for multiplayer text chat and menu options.At its heart, this dynamic works! Chief is starting to feel tired after all these years of being a videogame hero, but his constant need for heroics and duty creates a wonderful tension with a stranded Pilot who is at the absolute end of his tether. The Weapon often risks coming across as gratingly naive and occasionally whedonesque in her quips, but she feels like a knowing throwback to Halo 1's version of Cortana\u2014a friendly voice to accompany you through ancient ruins and apocalyptic schemes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1443bcd1-64a2-467d-be30-41b00fc9c638": {"__data__": {"id_": "1443bcd1-64a2-467d-be30-41b00fc9c638", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a327c49-5096-4e66-8fb8-65e0d5d8227e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fce5b415f986b56f4d8287b49a82c27e1645b3eb60cefed616f6b118c050e71"}, "3": {"node_id": "859ef64c-3eae-4a4f-800b-f29c94fa763c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f71c428df0035595a860e9970448906dbedcbd5d99018912104de859b541189c"}}, "hash": "82434b808190bb656f79285ad1a339e3bd65453c87a38b91d1cc75f103dbd9f2", "text": "A family can be a big green man, his blue holographic partner and a nervous wreck at the helm of a 130-ton dropship, and that's okay.They're a good foundation for a story, but unless you're clued in on Halo 5 (and RTS spin-off Halo Wars 2) the story is a hot confusing mess. The Banished simply aren't interesting baddies, a straight reskin of The Covenant only redder and meaner, but they soon share the stage with 343's favourite trope. Halo's established ancient aliens, The Forerunners, aren't mysterious anymore, so we're introduced to a new ancient alien who has a grudge against the Forerunners and, by proxy, humanity.Any mystery Halo used to hold has been lost under a deluge of proper nouns and thousand-year machinations, and keeping track of it is exhausting. That's likely why, when all is said and done, the story isn't even really about The Banished, or The Harbinger, or The Endless. It's about Master Chief and Cortana, a relationship that even with the latter's absence, drives everything our big green man does throughout the game. And truth be told, it's not a relationship that's ever worked for me.Infinite wants to kick off a new era of Halo by asking why we fell in love with it in the first place. In moments, even my jaded old heart can feel it. Exploring the open world after wrapping the campaign is a joy, exploring nooks and crannies for secrets, basking in the alien beauty of watching the sun set behind the ring and rising on the other side of it moments later. Wrapping up all those side missions I skipped and admitting that they probably were best left until now, when I'm done with the story but still hankering for some good Halo fights.Halo Infinite really is good Halo. For lapsed fans of the Bungie games like me, Halo Infinite is a strong return to form, and in the heat of battle it's the best running and gunning the series has ever had. It's painfully easy to imagine a world where Infinite could have easily been one of my favourite entries to date. But between an open world that feels largely redundant and a story that can't shed the series' baggage, Halo Infinite's campaign falls just shy of being great Halo.Halo Infinite can't quite deliver on being an open-world throwback, but it's the best shooting the series has seen to date.20 years ago, Nat played Jet Set Radio Future for the first time, and she's not stopped thinking about games since.

Halo Infinite is Halo as you remember it; Halo Infinite is Halo as you've never seen it before.\u00a0While 343 may have been at the helm of this series for a decade now, it never felt as if the studio truly understood what it had in its hands. Halo 4 was too thematically familiar, Halo 5: Guardians too mechanically expansive, and the scars left by the corrosive launch of The Master Chief Collection never healed over for many in the community. In Halo Infinite, the response to such a sustained campaign of criticism is one of deliberate defiance.\u00a0Halo Infinite is a spirited return to the familiar fundamentals that underpinned Combat Evolved, reclaiming a sense of discovery that, while once at the heart of Halo, has gradually withered over time. It's a truly expansive experience too, shoving Spartan-117 out of the small sandboxes he's been so comfortable playing in for all these years to encourage exploration of the entire playground. And tying it all together is a free-to-play multiplayer component which pulls players across three platforms into one shared, competitive arena.

Master Chief is tasked with getting planetside and battling back the Banished frontline, fighting for inches of ground as he chases the ghosts of his past.\u00a0Infinite is set 18-months after the devastating conclusion to Halo 5: Guardians and, aside from a handful of collectible audio logs detailing life aboard the UNSC Infinity, it isn't all that interested in exploring what happened in the interim. 343 has made a concerted effort to strip Halo down to its essentials, to make it more manageable for players coming in without two decades of lore committed to memory: there's a super soldier to control, a hostile alien world to tame, and a blue-hued hologram to befriend.\u00a0It's in this stranglehold where Halo Infinite struggles under the weight of its own legacy. Players new to Halo won't be properly equipped to appreciate much of the drama at the heart of Infinite's overarching narrative, while series veterans will likely lament the absence of so many supporting characters \u2013 many of whom have become so intrinsic to the feel of the Halo universe. But for those that have been with Chief since the beginning, the story satisfyingly resolves an arc that's been steadily building since Halo 2 \u2013 even if the road to reach the end can be a little bumpy at times. And, yes, you may well cry by the time the credits roll.\u00a0The way 343 tells this story is a break from convention. Halo Infinite eschews the breakneck, cinematic structure that the series has dutifully followed since its beginning, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Core missions unfurl within beautifully-lit corridors and perfectly-staged sandboxes, just as well as they always have done, but Chief now has the opportunity to explore the world around him between the litany of lengthy boss battles and tiresome monologues.\u00a0The influence of Combat Evolved missions like 'Arriving on Halo' and 'The Silent Cartographer' are clear, informing the vibe and visual aesthetic of Halo Infinite's world and the pace at which you're able to move through it. Much like the game that started the series, most of the action plays out beneath a truly stunning skybox, dominated by an awe-inspiring alien superstructure that bends off into the stratosphere. While Halo Infinite lacks the level of polish and visual detailing you may expect from a flagship Xbox Series X experience, Installation 07 can be an undeniably beautiful space to spend your time on. \u00a0\u00a0Zeta Halo isn't an \"open world\" in how we traditionally think about them in this era; it isn't as large or as loud as the spaces presented in Borderlands, Fallout, or Far Cry. Instead, it's spacious and stripped-back, designed to encourage gradual progression and exploration. Access to new sections of the map are granted slowly over time, gated by progression of the story, so you're never left feeling overwhelmed by the world state or by a mess of waypoints.If you really want a traditional Halo experience, you can find it in Infinite.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fde4edc4-c1ff-490e-8233-cce930a93918": {"__data__": {"id_": "fde4edc4-c1ff-490e-8233-cce930a93918", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "859ef64c-3eae-4a4f-800b-f29c94fa763c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f71c428df0035595a860e9970448906dbedcbd5d99018912104de859b541189c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4344cf96-cac8-41d1-a87d-4e90de6f005f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0c0c484cdd31d46c2c289ce1c5bba24aeb3bbfcb698deba2d00b5ec0472f60c"}}, "hash": "f0a74e4782309be4fda94e5d6fd7d57d434ba3346593f3bdf4efe367e4c069f1", "text": "The world itself is largely optional, so you can restlessly barrel down the golden path if you want to \u2013 bookending each linear mission with a short drive in a Warthog and the occasional fight with roving packs of sharply-written, and surprisingly tough, Elite, Grunts, and Jackals. If Bungie had the technology and resources to build an open world back in 2001, you have to imagine that it would have looked something like this.\u00a0Of course, focusing on the critical path would miss the point entirely. You'll want to spend time exploring Zeta Halo because it is a world worth exploring. Not because it floods you with points-of-interest, but because it is a naturally curious landscape. It's fun to look around, to use the new Grapple Shot to quickly scale the environment, or to jump behind the wheel of your favorite vehicle and go off searching for hidden Skulls on mountaintops and other secrets in shadowy loot caves. You never know what you might find, or what opportunities to engage the Banished might arise, when you're out in the wilderness.\u00a0The structure and pacing of the world smartly reflects Chief's struggle. While he is working against the clock to disable the Installation, he's also trying to gain a foothold against the Banished and rally what little is left of the UNSC around him. As a result, each section of the map contains a handful of overrun Forward Operating Bases to reclaim, and Banished Strongholds that need to be taken offline.\u00a0The FOBs effectively act as anchor points for exploration. Recapture a base and it will reveal optional objectives and collectibles in your immediate vicinity \u2013 Marines can be rescued (and later recruited for combat-ops); Banished bounty targets will relinquish fun weapon variants once defeated; Spartan Cores can be collected and used to upgrade your equipment (such as your Shields or Grapple Shot), while Weapon Lockers will unlock unique cosmetics for use in multiplayer. It's all extremely manageable, and the cycle of moving into an area, capturing an FOB, clearing the space of waypoints, and then moving onto the next was enjoyable all throughout my 18-hour playtime.FOBs can also be used to requisition unlocked weapons and vehicles, and replenish your ammunition. It's here where Halo's dynamic shifts, as you begin equipping yourself to push against Infinite's more challenging enemy strongholds \u2013 packed to the rafters with devilishly sharp Banished forces. Historically, Halo games have typically felt open and reactive, but what you could accomplish in any of its sandbox arenas was ultimately governed by whatever weapons or vehicles 343 (and Bungie) made available to you. But in Halo Infinite, every instance of combat is interpretive.\u00a0The amount of choice you have in Halo Infinite is staggering in this respect. You can park up outside a Banished facility and pick Jackals off at range with an S7 Sniper Rifle, descending into the chaos you've engineered once ammunition wears thin. Perhaps you could Grapple Shot over the defensive perimeter and begin raining M41 SPNKR rockets down on unsuspecting Brutes. Maybe you call-in a Warthog at an FOB, pack it with Marines wielding power weapons, and drive right on up to the front gates of the base with the horn blaring. Whatever your approach, the enemy AI will always respond in kind. It's challenging, it's kinetic, and it's always exhilarating.\u00a0What's impressive is that Infinite always feels like classic Halo once combat is initiated. Movement is tight and methodical, a frantic rush of gunfire, grenades, and melee strikes \u2013 your peripheral vision filled with swarming enemies across a variety of distances and verticalities. Combat may be more open-ended than ever before, and yet it retains its crafted feel \u2013 as if every encounter is tailor-made just for you, when the truth is any two players may have an entirely different experience. The absence of co-op at launch is all the more painful once the scale of Halo Infinite's combat becomes clear.Thankfully, 343 pulled back on many of the more divisive elements introduced in Halo 5: Guardians. While Master Chief is still able to sprint, mantle, and aim-down-sights of every firearm, the Spartan abilities have been removed. No longer are you able to shoulder-charge enemies, unleash ground pound attacks, or use stabilizers to hover in mid-air. The focus is back to moving fast and building momentum, strafing in and out of fire as the sound of your recharging energy shield dominates the soundscape. Movement is grounded and tactile, even as you use the Grapple Shot to reel yourself toward aggressors or away from danger.Speaking of equipment, while it makes a welcomed return to play from Halo 3, much of it is perfunctory.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4344cf96-cac8-41d1-a87d-4e90de6f005f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4344cf96-cac8-41d1-a87d-4e90de6f005f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "fde4edc4-c1ff-490e-8233-cce930a93918", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0a74e4782309be4fda94e5d6fd7d57d434ba3346593f3bdf4efe367e4c069f1"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1e531ae-2cea-401c-bc92-e9b4b776da9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed0a701817be115a9433bdd7d148f8f55287d387226bb685c5834de07f94ed26"}}, "hash": "a0c0c484cdd31d46c2c289ce1c5bba24aeb3bbfcb698deba2d00b5ec0472f60c", "text": "Not only is it fiddly to switch between your unlocks with the D-Pad, particularly in the middle of frantic combat encounters, but it's only the Grapple Shot that has any real utility. The Drop Wall is a faint echo of the Bubble Shield, the Thrusters are only useful on the rare occasion a pair of Hunters emerge, while the Threat Sensor is rarely worth the effort of equipping it. And that's even after you upgrade the lot with collected Spartan Cores. Truth be told, the Grapple Shot is such a revelatory addition \u2013 expanding the scope of play so successfully both in and out of combat \u2013 that there's rarely any point switching away from it.\u00a0Halo Infinite is an undeniable good time. Movement is weighty and tactile, retaining the grounded feel that's inherent to all good Halo games, without sacrificing any of your agility or mobility. Combat is fast and reactive, with enemy AI constantly pushing you to utilize everything around you for survival \u2013 equipment, weapons, and even the environment itself. The decision to shift Halo's long-established traditions into a sprawling open-ended sandbox only works to expand the scope of play in its favor.Against impossible odds, Halo Infinite is both a familiar celebration of two decades of adventures with Master Chief and an expansive foundation for future evolution. 343 has siphoned the spirit of Combat Evolved and modernized it, delivering the best Halo campaign in quite some time in the process. Whether you're a series veteran coming in to finish another fight, or a new player landing on Zeta Halo to start one, this is one adventure you should jump right into.\u00a0Halo Infinite was reviewed on Xbox Series X, with code provided by the publisher.Josh West is the UK Managing Editor of GamesRadar+.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, The multiplayer has already been out for weeks but how does the story campaign for Halo Infinite compare to the rest of the series?What a long, strange ride it\u2019s been for Halo Infinite. Announced back in 2018, with little explanation of what it was or what it intended to do, the game became a laughing stock in its first gameplay reveal, primarily thanks to its sub-par graphics. That resulted in a year long delay that meant it completely missed the launch of the Xbox Series X/S and only barely made it out this year, with the Forge and campaign co-op options having to be delayed until 2022.That\u2019s only one of many problems with reviewing the game at launch, with the most obvious being the fact that the multiplayer was released as a free-to-play download three weeks ago. If you have any interest in Halo at all you\u2019ll already have formed your own opinion on how that\u2019s worked out, although concerns over the progression system mean it is undergoing major change even before the main game\u2019s launch.We\u2019ve always been strong believers in a scored review, but Halo Infinite really does test the limits of its usefulness.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1e531ae-2cea-401c-bc92-e9b4b776da9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1e531ae-2cea-401c-bc92-e9b4b776da9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "4344cf96-cac8-41d1-a87d-4e90de6f005f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0c0c484cdd31d46c2c289ce1c5bba24aeb3bbfcb698deba2d00b5ec0472f60c"}, "3": {"node_id": "294c9b69-5adf-412d-90df-0f34aa938c87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ff2ec2e8104c6b9a97ebc6c0429f05640c1f0ec35d74278192a9eabb4d56d11"}}, "hash": "ed0a701817be115a9433bdd7d148f8f55287d387226bb685c5834de07f94ed26", "text": "The multiplayer is by far the best part of Halo Infinite and while the campaign is no disaster it\u2019s something we\u2019d hesitate to recommend at full price\u2026 except of course most Xbox owners won\u2019t be buying it as a standalone package but as part of Game Pass. All of which makes coming to a final verdict almost impossible.This review will take in both sides of Halo Infinite but since the multiplayer has been out for so long already, and we\u2019ve already reviewed it as a sperate entity, the focus will naturally be on the campaign. The story mode is an entirely separate option, that gives every impression of being created by an entirely separate team, and the first thing that becomes clear is that despite the name this is very much Halo 6.Presumably it wasn\u2019t called that because Microsoft didn\u2019t want people to think they had to play the other five to know what\u2019s going on. That makes sense except\u2026 if you have haven\u2019t played the other five \u2013 or at least Halo 4 and 5 \u2013 you really won\u2019t have a clue as to what\u2019s happening or who anyone is. In fact, you should add Halo Wars 2 to that list, as Halo Infinite features extensive plot elements from that as well.While the multiplayer has a whole separate section dedicated to explaining every element of its design, the campaign makes zero attempt to explain anything. There\u2019s no clue as to who or what Master Chief is, who he\u2019s fighting and what they want, who Cortana was and what she did, what a Halo is or\u2026 anything really. Given Halo 5 was six years ago the lack of context, or even something as simple as a \u2018Previously on Halo\u2019 summary, is absolutely bizarre.The laconic Master Chief has always been something of a blank slate but this time round his AI companion is literally that, which means the only individual with any proper characterisation is an annoying pilot who is clearly meant to be sympathetic and, unlike the other two leads, very human, but he just comes across as an annoying whiner.Halo Infinite won\u2019t be winning any storytelling awards, but the strange inaccessibility of the plot is nothing compared to the peculiar structure of the campaign itself. Although developer 343 Industries has been careful not to describe the campaign as open world, we think most people assumed that was just meant in the same manner as Sony\u2019s insistence that God Of War wasn\u2019t fully open world either. But that\u2019s not what 343 mean.What they\u2019re getting at is that after the two intro levels the game becomes fully open world until about the halfway point in the plot and then goes back to being just straight, linear levels right up until the very end. As such, you only get to return to the open world again after you\u2019ve beaten the story (at which point everything has become trivially easy and you\u2019re ticking off icons from the map in a manner that makes the worst Ubisoft games seem organic and unpredictable).Maybe we missed a memo but that was not what we were expecting, and we\u2019re pretty sure no-one else was either. It\u2019s not necessarily a problem \u2013 the open world isn\u2019t very varied in terms of scenery or objectives and you\u2019re not especially sad to see it go \u2013 but it is very, very strange. Especially as almost everything after the halfway point happens in non-descript sci-fi corridors that look like they\u2019re from an Xbox 360 game (the same is largely true of the open world as well, with a lot of very ugly object pop-in).Of course, that is largely the point; maybe not in terms of the low-tech visuals but while this is not a soft reboot in terms of story it is when it comes to the back-to-basics gameplay. In Halo Infinite you\u2019re playing as Master Chief all the time and while you\u2019re technically not fighting the Covenant the alien species are the same as the original games, with only one rarely seen, and not especially interesting, addition.The gunplay is very good, but it does lack the same distinct physicality of Bungie\u2019s work. And yet for better or worse the weird control system and unconvincing physics for vehicles is the same as always. There are other modern shooters that do both things better, but Halo Infinite is not that far behind, and the failings barely register in multiplayer.In the campaign it becomes more noticeable simply because there\u2019s not anything else to do.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "294c9b69-5adf-412d-90df-0f34aa938c87": {"__data__": {"id_": "294c9b69-5adf-412d-90df-0f34aa938c87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1e531ae-2cea-401c-bc92-e9b4b776da9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed0a701817be115a9433bdd7d148f8f55287d387226bb685c5834de07f94ed26"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e27989f-6d82-48eb-8e9b-af2e95bd372e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d59c6a60726c9d6aac76fbd5f5c271adb740125983d58d27abbd6725c57f3f03"}}, "hash": "2ff2ec2e8104c6b9a97ebc6c0429f05640c1f0ec35d74278192a9eabb4d56d11", "text": "There are secrets to be found but almost all of them are highlighted on your map as soon as you get close to them, so there\u2019s rarely any surprise as you reclaim enemy bases, blow up propaganda towers, rescue squads of soldiers, and collect Spartan cores to unlock new equipment abilities.The open world design is okay but it always feels strangely cramped, with too little room for vehicles to run free and no way to destroy the trees that are always in the way. It\u2019s actually much more fun to use your new grappling hook gadget, which while a collectible in multiplayer is with you from the start in the campaign. It\u2019s easily the best new idea in the game and has no limitation on what it can hook onto, including reeling yourself towards enemies to give them an extra hard sock in the face when you get there.It\u2019s extremely easy to pick holes with Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign but while 343 never find anything particularly interesting or new to do with the open world it\u2019s perfectly fine. Plus, the weird campaign structure, by accident or design, ensures that neither style lingers enough for familiarity to turn into contempt.Instead, the main failing is that the campaign never takes enough advantage of the things Halo is best known for. There\u2019s surprisingly little vehicle combat, the artificial intelligence is a few steps above the norm but never stands out as much as it did in the early games, and while there are fun sandbox moments \u2013 we literally died laughing at one moment, where we shot a Grunt and their backpack exploded, killing the Brute next to them \u2013 they\u2019re too few and far between.If we were reviewing the campaign as a standalone game, it\u2019d get a 7/10 at best but the multiplayer is harder to pin down. What\u2019s there is great fun, and it\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s been an instant hit as it\u2019s a welcome alternative to the predictability of Call Of Duty: Vanguard and the weird aloofness of Battlefield 2042.Characters move faster than classic Halo but the action still feels enjoyably old school, with no loadouts or directional boosts (unless you pick them up as a power-up) and straightforward weapons with only cosmetic customisation. Not even aiming down sight is essential, which is a pleasing change of pace not just for Halo but first person shooters in general.The fun comes from not only the quality of the action but it\u2019s accessibility, with the unusually long TTK (time to kill) meaning that it\u2019s easier for new players to learn and harder for veterans to take advantage of their experience.The problem, as has been widely reported, is the progression system, which is absolutely horrible. It\u2019s already being referred to by some as \u2018pay-to-progress\u2019, not only because of the expensive battle pass you have to buy to get anything (there\u2019s almost nothing of value to unlock if you don\u2019t) but that even with that the game is still riddled with microtransactions.Things like changing the colour of your armour has been restricted purely so that more money can be wrung out of players and yet even if you do buy the battle pass, the amount of experience you earn from each match is pitifully small. 343 have tried to address this already, with a small update, but it underlines how much the design is based around limiting when and how you unlock anything \u2013 with the initial Fracture: Tenrai event set to drag on until April in six separate weekly stretches.The online action is great, but everything could easily be ruined if Microsoft\u2019s greed overtakes its better judgement. Like any such title it\u2019s impossible to offer a final word at launch, even with the three week preview, but despite these issues \u2013 and concerns about increasing levels of cheaters \u2013 Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer is easily the best new online shooter of the year and one of the best reasons to own an Xbox Series X/S.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationThe campaign is not though.

With each explosive cannon blast, the outer sentries prove they\u2019re not much of a threat, but my foes have prepared for this approach, and the narrow mountain path hits a blockade. While my marines disembark and charge ahead, I grapple up into the nearby hills and begin to pick off Jackals with a unique variant sniper rifle \u2013 spoils of an earlier conquest. But no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and I\u2019m eventually scaling the outer fort wall and dropping into a nest of entrenched Brutes, as the familiar rattle of my assault rifle begins to clear the way.Halo Infinite walks a narrow line between old and new and does it with as much success as I\u2019ve seen from a game. As one of the most recognizable \u201cfeels\u201d of play, it\u2019s confidently nostalgic and rooted in an established legacy, ably recalling the earliest games in the series. Whether it\u2019s the satisfying stick of a plasma grenade, the haughty cries of a sword-wielding stealth Elite, or the gradual discovery of a mysterious Halo ring, Infinite is an homage to Combat Evolved, 20 years after that first release. Simultaneously, 343 Industries\u2019 new game charts its own course. Equipment like the incredibly satisfying grappleshot, open-world elements that inject increased opportunities for exploration, and freeform base assaults that challenge players to think creatively \u2013 all of these and more help the formula stay fresh and relevant. The balancing act works, and this is the best a Halo game has felt in over a decade.Master Chief\u2019s latest adventure opens in media res, with his defeat at the hands of a Brute warlord and the destruction of the UNSC Infinity. It\u2019s a reset of expectations about where the story was going after the last game and a figurative teardown of the complicated fictional framework that defined the previous two series entries. Master Chief awakens six months later, with a new, more na\u00efve AI companion at his side, and sets to work doing what he does best \u2013 overcoming insurmountable odds one bullet at a time.The resultant story is relatively simple, as he unwinds the mystery of what happened during his absence, but the narrative is tinged by vaguely mystical overtones about the absent Cortana and the long-forgotten secrets of the Halo. While some questions get answers, Infinite revels in its head-scratching perplexities, and even fervent lore enthusiasts may reach the conclusion with a resounding \u201chuh?\u201d That, too, keeps to the old Halo form, but this time I found much more to enjoy in the genuine character moments of hope and resilience, and I could have used a bit less bewilderment.Halo Infinite\u2019s production values are through the roof, with breathtaking outdoor vistas and imposing cathedral-like interiors.

In action, everything moves and crackles with tension and excitement, from weapon flashes to vehicle explosions.Combat plays like a dream, and whatever else a player might enjoy or dislike, the action should motivate players to complete a playthrough. Each gun brings something rewarding to the table, and enemies are fierce and challenging, especially as you make a run at that vaunted legendary difficulty setting. In particular, boss fights on the more demanding settings are tense and exciting \u2013 a rare feat in first-person shooters. The new equipment, particularly the grappleshot, has a transformative effect on gameplay, leading to more mobile and vertical play. Battles carry a constant sense of movement and momentum, and I couldn\u2019t wait for each subsequent encounter.The new open-world and progression elements borrow heavily from established successes in that genre, and there\u2019s nothing profoundly innovative about the gradual takeover of a zone. But the battles feel so good that I didn\u2019t mind too much. I especially enjoyed the larger bases and outposts, which encourage creative thinking in how you approach routing the bad guys. I also loved the small moments of discovery \u2013 hidden weapon caches on a mountaintop or caves that hold the last weapons of a doomed Marine squad.Infinite\u2019s accompanying multiplayer suite is free-to-play, and it warrants a similar level of enthusiasm to the lengthy campaign. Whether in tense ranked matches, desperately running to capture a flag in quickplay, or smashing Warthogs together in 24-player Big Team Battles, the core competitive shooting is fast and enormously fun. The \u201cfair start\u201d mentality is a breath of fresh air in a multiplayer scene dominated by games with earned weapons or mismatched classes; here, if you win an exchange, it\u2019s because you scavenged the right gun and fought the best engagement.Slow multiplayer progression systems, limited character customization, and individual weapon and grenade balance all need a good bit of adjustment in these early weeks of play. Those elements hurt my enjoyment of an otherwise rewarding match-to-match experience. But those features have already been tweaked since launch, and may be significantly different weeks from now, so there\u2019s a limit to how much I want to tear the game down when the actual multiplayer battles are so much fun.Like many, I\u2019m sad that Halo Infinite doesn\u2019t offer cooperative multiplayer at launch, if only because it\u2019s been a bulwark of the series\u2019 identity. It\u2019s a disappointing omission, but I have to judge the game before me, not the features I wish might be there. And by that measure, Halo Infinite is a rousing success. Whether you want a big, mysterious sci-fi adventure or a chance to engage with some intense PvP, Halo Infinite nails the shots where it counts and heralds a new era for one of gaming\u2019s most recognizable mainstays.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer. All Rights Reserved.\nGameSpot, Halo Infinite transforms the series' two-decade-old formula for the better, giving protagonist Master Chief more characterization and implementing an open world.By \n    Jordan Ram\u00e9e\n   on December 6, 2021 at 12:01AM PSTThe complex relationship between Halo protagonist Master Chief and his AI partner Cortana has always been one of the strongest driving forces for the franchise--it's a genuine bond, but one born out of manipulation, as Cortana (an AI based on the mind of the woman who kidnapped Chief as a child) is gifted to Chief as a perfect companion to ensure he maintains peak efficiency as a super-soldier. In this way, Cortana has always been the more dominant voice in the partnership. She tells Chief where to go and what to do, and Chief's single-mindedness coupled with the ability to solely rely on her means he never has to develop emotionally healthy bonds with normal human beings.Halo Infinite is the first time we've seen that kind of relationship dynamic flipped. Paired with a new AI, simply named \"the Weapon,\" Chief takes on a more fatherly figure in Infinite. Where Cortana was assertive, quick-witted, and mature, the Weapon is awkward, overly trusting, and silly. She sounds and acts like a child-like version of Cortana, pushing Chief into taking on a more domineering role that has far greater control over her. This opens some intriguing new opportunities for a Halo story--in a franchise that has long had an undercurrent theme of familial connection and motherhood, Infinite is the first in the series to focus its narrative around familial responsibility and fatherhood.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaf9d030-858f-4572-9607-fbf459009040": {"__data__": {"id_": "aaf9d030-858f-4572-9607-fbf459009040", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "dbcd73c6-a224-4762-ba7e-0fe1f6665db0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4783ebcaa97f350b863b69cf1ea88f57712d2feddfc99e618510fadb38ca647"}, "3": {"node_id": "440984e4-fe0d-43a2-adfe-c8ee6a4b5eb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8d991a103afe66013dff9341fe56c5bf97bcc3c0d4b1f05d124c356dcaa4b38"}}, "hash": "48b51aafc31b4ce0f81aa7160f0f36396ae02042d006bc33c35ed92246f894fc", "text": "The strength of that narrative, alongside the open world and new traversal mechanics, delivers a welcoming freshness to the two-decade-old series.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Halo Infinite Campaign ReviewOther than Chief, Halo Infinite doesn't have much in the way of familiar faces. Very early into the campaign, you're confronted with the startling reveal that a lot of the folks you've come to know over Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Halo Wars 2 are dead or missing in action. Chief finds himself on a new Halo ring named Zeta Halo, which has been partially destroyed. The Banished, an independent army of multiple alien species that splintered off the Covenant, want the ring for some unknown purpose, and Chief vows to stop them. Without any of his usual allies to turn to, Chief ropes two unwitting companions into his fight--the aforementioned Weapon, who was supposed to delete herself following completion of her purpose, and the Pilot, a man desperately trying to just get home to United Nations Space Command (UNSC) space after being stranded all alone for months.The first half of Act 1 and most of Act 3 are traditional Halo: contained, linear levels where you're guided through gauntlets of enemies. The rest of the game incorporates a hybrid open world. You're able to freely move through a wide open area and pursue optional side missions, or beeline for the next main story objective. Reaching those objectives typically funnels you back into the more traditional Halo level design, only for Chief to emerge into the open world again once the mission is complete.In this way, Infinite maintains the cinematic quality of Halo's traditionally linear campaigns while also incorporating an open world to explore. Those optional side missions bring aspects of Halo's multiplayer into Infinite's campaign, creating scenarios in which players can approach a problem in numerous ways, each of which can lead to satisfying and occasionally hilarious outcomes. For example, a base that needs storming can be charged into on foot; you could take out enemies stealthily with a sniper rifle from afar before approaching; or just go for broke and crash a Banshee into the base, eject at the last minute, and pull out a shotgun to clean up any remaining resistance. Experimentation is often rewarded with satisfying victory or a story of how everything went hilariously wrong. Regardless of the approach taken, it's fun to dismantle the Banished's encampments on Zeta Halo, wrestling control away from them slowly but surely.Even on Infinite's harder difficulties, you can easily skip over all the optional missions and still get that linear Halo experience if you want, but Infinite provides compelling reasons for stepping off the main path. In a first for a Halo campaign, there's an in-game progression system. Completing tasks like saving captured UNSC soldiers and destroying Banished roadblocks or refineries nets you Valor, which unlocks new vehicles and weapons that can be summoned at Forward Operating Bases across the map, allowing you to bring your favorite loadouts into future side-quests and story missions. You can also find Spartan Cores, which are spent to upgrade Chief's equipment. Perhaps my favorite upgrade is an electrified current for Halo's version of a grappling hook, the Grappleshot. This upgrade allows Chief to stun enemies by latching onto them, leaving them defenseless against a satisfyingly hard-hitting follow-up melee strike.From a gameplay perspective, the Grappleshot is the true star of Infinite's campaign. Though there are plenty of firearms, melee weapons, and grenades for Chief to use--and each tears through enemies with a nice kinetic, plasma, or electrical punch--the Grappleshot fundamentally changes how you play a Halo game for the better. In terms of traversal, a grappling hook makes Chief more nimble and opens up new vertical pathways while exploring Zeta Halo. But the tool is far more valuable in combat, allowing you to grab far-off firearms when your current one runs out of bullets, pull you into range so that Chief can land some solid hits with a shotgun or Gravity Hammer, or simply get you the heck out of dodge if things get too hot. It opens up brand-new strategies for handling old enemies too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "440984e4-fe0d-43a2-adfe-c8ee6a4b5eb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "440984e4-fe0d-43a2-adfe-c8ee6a4b5eb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "aaf9d030-858f-4572-9607-fbf459009040", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "48b51aafc31b4ce0f81aa7160f0f36396ae02042d006bc33c35ed92246f894fc"}, "3": {"node_id": "48817f20-7eb3-4bbd-b720-cc464e70b55f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6288287fd66eba7224f1924fe1610ce595fe16f3a8b19c0d1251f8e849a2767f"}}, "hash": "f8d991a103afe66013dff9341fe56c5bf97bcc3c0d4b1f05d124c356dcaa4b38", "text": "It opens up brand-new strategies for handling old enemies too. For instance, nimble Elites can be slowed down by grabbing them with the Grappleshot, and shield-bearing Jackals will momentarily drop their guard if you grapple and pull at their shields.The Grappleshot makes Chief a faster and more efficient killer. You're still doing the same loop of gunfire, grenades, and melee, and the dance of using your shield to tank hits and taking cover when said shield is broken is still the same too, but Chief can storm through enemies far more efficiently now, adding a dynamism and more strategic considerations to the tried-and-true formula. With the Grappleshot, it becomes possible to quickly flank enemies, grab new guns, or launch back into the fight. Chief just feels faster and more deadly--it's so rewarding to pull off incredible plays with the Grappleshot, especially since its fast cooldown time means you can use it repeatedly. And since Chief starts the game with the Grappleshot in his arsenal, you get plenty of practice with it by the time you actually reach Zeta Halo and walk into Infinite's open world. The game does a good job of ensuring that using the Grappleshot is as natural as shooting or sliding.Chief's remaining equipment doesn't quite reach the same highs as the Grappleshot, but the various tools are still valuable in combat, each in their own way. Enemies hit Chief hard in the Heroic and Legendary difficulties, and mastering how to use all of his equipment opens up new means of taking them on and surviving. Oftentimes, it can feel like Infinite is actively discouraging you from engaging with the other equipment though. The Grappleshot is unbelievably useful in practically every situation, and you have to temporarily switch away from it with the D-pad to use Chief's other equipment--not an easy input to use while sprinting, jumping, shooting, and sliding your way through a hectic firefight. This does lessen the impact of unlocking a new ability, as it's hard to get excited over new equipment when I know I'm likely only going to use it a few times so that I can keep the Grappleshot always at the ready in my fight against the Banished.Less interesting than the Grappleshot is the principal antagonist, a Brute named Escharum who acts as the war chief of the Banished. The dude's got an incredible \"I am clearly the bad guy\" voice that reverberates with a growling rumble whenever he monologues, but his motivations don't really extend beyond being the leader of a group of bloodthirsty killers. Prior to the events of Infinite, Escharum waged a six-month war that saw him psychologically and physically dismantle the UNSC's soldiers and Spartans, but none of that Escharum is present in Infinite. He's described as this devastatingly brutal leader who humans fear, but we see none of that nuance in the game. There's a brief hint that the Brute has become desperate for a warrior's death and wants Chief to face him so that he can have it, but it's introduced in the story too late to make him a meaningful villain worth caring about.Instead, the intriguing characterization is reserved for Chief, the Weapon, and the Pilot. The trio form a family unit, with Chief at the head. This setup affords some incredible insight into Chief's psyche, as the armored warrior is confronted with two allies who aren't career soldiers. A truly incredible scene partway through the game sees the Pilot and Chief confront each other and what follows is a rare moment of vulnerability that humanizes Chief in an unexpected and meaningful way. Scenes like this are sprinkled throughout the campaign, as Chief, the Pilot, and the Weapon all confront their own humanity and their innate responsibility to each other as (admittedly very different) human consciousnesses.One moment in particular, however, does not land. Partway through Infinite, Chief takes away the Weapon's agency in a problematic way. The Weapon is understandably upset at the betrayal and lashes out at Chief's callous actions, only for her to quickly soften and forgive him upon learning his motivations. It feels like a rushed development, and one that unfortunately implies that, if they have a good reason, dads have a responsibility to decide a child's entire life the second said child steps out of line. The whole thing isn't resolved in a great way.While the quality of writing may occasionally dip, each key scene is bolstered by Infinite's superb soundtrack. The nature of the hybrid open world means that most of Infinite's major story beats and the conversations between characters occur in set locations, and so the orchestral score can be carefully timed with the game's most poignant moments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48817f20-7eb3-4bbd-b720-cc464e70b55f": {"__data__": {"id_": "48817f20-7eb3-4bbd-b720-cc464e70b55f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "440984e4-fe0d-43a2-adfe-c8ee6a4b5eb7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f8d991a103afe66013dff9341fe56c5bf97bcc3c0d4b1f05d124c356dcaa4b38"}, "3": {"node_id": "4972d748-3a2b-4379-853f-6553bd883582", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8812594f5167f8feaded3c8a81783591548ad8a94551a26685e5e6121ae3331f"}}, "hash": "6288287fd66eba7224f1924fe1610ce595fe16f3a8b19c0d1251f8e849a2767f", "text": "There has yet to be a mainline Halo game with anything less than an absolute banger of a musical score, and Infinite does not buck that trend. The rich score is helped along by the equally impressive level of detail 343 Industries has achieved with facial expressions (at least on Xbox Series X). Having a rousing score accompanied by believable acting and expressions means there is a collection of genuinely epic and tragic moments in Infinite that really land.You can also take a break from Chief and company by heading into the Academy, which introduces Halo Infinite's multiplayer and how the UNSC are training a new batch of Spartan IVs in the wake of Chief's disappearance at the start of the campaign. Alongside a detailed tutorial on the controls for Infinite, the Academy includes a number of well-made weapon drills, providing an approachable means of testing out each firearm in the game without having to worry about something shooting back at you, creating an ideal space for learning more about what each weapon does. It's a good addition, especially since it's not especially apparent what the secondary effects of some of Infinite's new firearms (like the Disruptor and Cindershot) are.The Academy is available in Halo Infinite's separate free-to-play online multiplayer as well. For my full thoughts on the game's online multiplayer, check out GameSpot's Halo Infinite multiplayer review in progress.Halo Infinite strives to transform what it means to be a Halo game, making Chief into a reluctant father figure for a young and naive AI and putting him into an open-world setting. It turns out that was a risk worth taking for the franchise, as Infinite is an incredible game. Certain story elements are on the weaker side and the amazing Grappleshot makes the rest of Chief's equipment feel a bit lacking in comparison, but these are small shortcomings in what otherwise feels like the best Halo campaign in years and an excellent evolution of what Halo can be.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:The magic is backIt\u2019s been more than 20 years since Master Chief \u2014 and Halo: Combat Evolved \u2014 debuted. In that time, the Halo series has become one of video games\u2019 most iconic legacies, while Master Chief has become the symbol of Xbox \u2014 and console-based first-person shooters \u2014 as a whole. It\u2019s a legacy that developer 343 Industries has struggled to carry since taking over from Bungie, releasing two new games that felt like something of a decline from the series\u2019 previous brilliance. Halo Infinite is intended to be a course correction, described by 343 as a \u201cspiritual reboot\u201d of the franchise, that not only reexamines what makes something feel like Halo, but also finds ways to push those qualities further.The new direction has paid off. For the first time in years, it feels like 343 knows where Halo is going. Halo Infinite somehow feels entirely like Halo and entirely not, transplanting the franchise\u2019s traditional linear narrative and mission structure into a semi-open world. It preserves the intensity of the series\u2019 combat while also finding the magic in the act of exploration. Halo Infinite is carrying a heavy legacy on its shoulders, and it\u2019s doing so with confidence.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

The Banished, a group of exiled Covenant followers, have defeated the United Nations Space Command and gained control of Zeta Halo, the big ol\u2019 ring that the UNSC Infinity slipspace-jumped to when escaping Cortana at the end of Halo 5: Guardians. Halo Infinite\u2019s main thrust is in regaining control over Zeta Halo, figuring out what happened to Cortana, and stopping the Banished from whatever bad thing they\u2019re doing. 343 Industries has said that Halo Infinite is a good place for Halo newcomers to start, but that\u2019s not entirely true. There are so many plot threads to pull on here (many of them from the real-time strategy spinoff Halo Wars 2) that even devout Halo fans may find themselves confused.Accompanying Chief on this journey are the Pilot \u2014 a UNSC survivor of the Banished attack that exiled the Chief \u2014 and the Weapon, an AI created to mimic Cortana and, ultimately, destroy her. While well-rounded characters in their own rights, the Pilot and the Weapon serve as audience surrogates in two drastically different ways.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4972d748-3a2b-4379-853f-6553bd883582": {"__data__": {"id_": "4972d748-3a2b-4379-853f-6553bd883582", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "48817f20-7eb3-4bbd-b720-cc464e70b55f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6288287fd66eba7224f1924fe1610ce595fe16f3a8b19c0d1251f8e849a2767f"}, "3": {"node_id": "266b2859-d9ea-4ab4-bacb-cbee4327acfa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a14ca2b9f13b6d31db69e03c777bd8c681009b23441a5f05fae1c6e54700548a"}}, "hash": "8812594f5167f8feaded3c8a81783591548ad8a94551a26685e5e6121ae3331f", "text": "The Pilot is well versed in the myth of the Master Chief and, like us, can get exasperated when the hero retreads the same habits he has countless times before. The Weapon, unfamiliar with the legacy of the Chief, is curious and skeptical: Who is this person, and why has humanity come to revere him? Master Chief is typically the savior or the demon, depending on who you ask. The Pilot and the Weapon are important prisms through which Infinite interrogates, and reconsiders, the myth of the Master Chief.Though Halo Infinite still tells a linear story, the structure of its world allows for exploration. When moving between mainline missions, there\u2019s plenty to stumble upon \u2014 trapped Marines to rescue, propaganda towers to destroy, high-value targets to take out \u2014 and it all encourages you to take the scenic route. (And please, do so: Banished propaganda towers are basically speakers that emit, essentially, a Grunt podcast centered around how terrible humans are, and it\u2019s extremely funny.) One of the more repetitive side tasks involves clearing Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), which are small hubs stocked with resources and collectibles. As I mentioned in my preview last month, there\u2019s a litany of ways to approach these encounters. Sometimes, I decided to drive a Razorback full of specialized Marines straight through the front door. In one case, I used a sniper rifle I discovered on a nearby cliffside, right next to a voice log from the Marine that, presumably, died there.Halo is not the first series whose developers have introduced an open-world structure later in its life cycle \u2014 Gears 5 and Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End also come to mind \u2014 but it is the most successful. 343 Industries has created a world in which Halo-style firefights occur organically, sometimes at a busy crossroads and sometimes in the middle of the woods. While testing out my Wasp \u2014 an aerial vehicle \u2014 I was shot out of the sky, falling directly into a skirmish with a high-value Banished target. In Halo Infinite, these emergent moments are the norm rather than the exception.One problem with the open-world format, though, is that 343 Industries is dropping a key feature of Halo\u2019s design legacy: the ability to replay story missions. It\u2019s a core part of my own Halo experience. I love adjusting skulls to make bigger explosions, add more challenges, and tweak the combat in unusual ways. I\u2019ve replayed some of my favorite Halo missions dozens of times over the years. I\u2019ve played some of them so much that I can run through them in my head, and I suspect that, given the chance, I\u2019d get to that point again with Halo Infinite.There are some environments in Infinite that become inaccessible once you\u2019ve completed a mission, meaning that you can\u2019t return to look for secrets. It\u2019s also a shame because certain missions feel like they\u2019re begging to be replayed. One is set in a Banished training facility. There are UNSC weapons and vehicles scattered on recreated set-pieces, and crumbling towers next to beat-up tanks. It\u2019s like a twisted museum that the Banished have created to combat their most hated foes. It feels like the embodiment of Halo as a franchise: a big sandbox brimming with explosive potential.\n    Related\n  That was key, for instance, in 2004\u2019s Halo 2. It wasn\u2019t an open game: It was very linear, often choosing long, dark hallways over spacious exteriors. But there was something about its design and story that made it feel massive, like there was an entire galaxy to run around in. The magic of that experience was that Bungie was able to create something that felt expansive, despite the limitations of the time. Halo Infinite\u2019s magic, then, is in fully realizing that vision. I don\u2019t just feel like I\u2019ve got an entire Halo to explore \u2014 I actually do, and I can\u2019t wait to see how that evolves from here, especially with co-op on the way.Though co-op isn\u2019t coming to Halo Infinite until next year, the game\u2019s free-to-play multiplayer component was released in beta nearly a month before the campaign to commemorate the original Xbox\u2019s (and Halo\u2019s) 20th anniversary.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "266b2859-d9ea-4ab4-bacb-cbee4327acfa": {"__data__": {"id_": "266b2859-d9ea-4ab4-bacb-cbee4327acfa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "4972d748-3a2b-4379-853f-6553bd883582", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8812594f5167f8feaded3c8a81783591548ad8a94551a26685e5e6121ae3331f"}, "3": {"node_id": "3589a3a1-b34f-47ae-a330-f7017c14fbd1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b6d2cc134fdba2f4bb50af7c329703bd81134bf637ca93698112b52271d83eb"}}, "hash": "a14ca2b9f13b6d31db69e03c777bd8c681009b23441a5f05fae1c6e54700548a", "text": "The staggered rollout has given 343 time to make adjustments ahead of the game\u2019s full release, and the studio has already done just that: It has made multiple tweaks to Halo Infinite\u2019s slow battle pass since the beta period began.Games such as Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Valorant dominate the multiplayer sphere now, and in going free-to-play, Halo is aiming to carve out its own space in the modern landscape. Aside from its progression hiccups, it\u2019s off to a great start. Despite the new release model, the moment-to-moment flow of Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer matches is unabashedly Halo, the kind of experience I remember from the era of Halo 3. Smaller maps make games fast paced and exciting, with the grappling hook adding a new layer of acrobatics. It\u2019s a familiar yet thrilling multiplayer experience that allows for both chaotic battles and precise plays.Unlike Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign, the multiplayer component does feel welcoming to newcomers. One excellent addition is the Academy, a tutorial that teaches the fundamentals before pitting you against AI bots. The weapons drill system in particular is a godsend, and I can\u2019t imagine a game without it. Drills are set up as minigames where I\u2019m testing how many targets I can eliminate in a set time period, and the stakes are low  enough that I feel comfortable experimenting with every weapon I can.\n    Related\n  Halo Infinite swaps out the loadouts and armor abilities of earlier games for a few new pickups, including the grappling hook, which is by far the most useful of these tools. After relying on it so much in Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign, it feels criminal to pass it by in multiplayer.In some ways, the grappling hook feels like a perfect microcosm of Halo Infinite as a whole. It\u2019s an addition that somehow shakes things up while also feeling like it belonged the entire time. In Halo Infinite\u2019s design tenets and its iconic characters, 343 Industries has created something that bears the weight of the Halo legacy, and it\u2019s poised to carry that weight into the future. It\u2019s invigorating to be so excited about Halo again. Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign will be released Dec. 8 on Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X; its multiplayer component is playable now.

Not just any Halo game but this Halo game\u2014one that was supposed to herald a new generation of Xboxes but was delayed out of the launch window; one that\u2019s had no shortage of public scrutiny over its tumultuous development process; one that\u2019s not even out yet but has already been the centerpiece of multiple internet-dominating conversations; and, most crucially, one that\u2019s meant to revitalize a totemic first-person shooter series after a stretch of metabolic dormancy. There are so many expectations on Halo Infinite\u2019s armor-clad shoulders that you\u2019d think it\u2019d crumble apart in a pile of pixels. Every single player is bound to come into this game with their own predetermined definition of what it is and what it stands for. I sure as hell did.So, yeah, let\u2019s just get the easy part out the way:\"So much for finishing the fight...\" - Kotaku.comHalo: The Greatest Hits (2001-2021)Pretty much everything except for the villain(s) and the absent co-op.The villain(s), the encounters that feel designed for co-op.343 IndustriesXbox One, Xbox Series X (played), Xbox Series S, PCDecember 8, 2021 (the multiplayer mode hit on November 15) 11 hours to hit the credits with 33 percent completion, but it\u2019s likely longer in real time, since the clock reverts upon death; a further 61 hours in multiplayer.Halo Infinite, officially out on Wednesday for Xbox and PC, is the seventh mainline Halo game and the first in six years, following 2015\u2019s divisive Halo 5: Guardians.

At times, it plays like a greatest hits album of iconic setpieces from Halo, Halo 2, and Halo 3 (which tracks, seeing as Joseph Staten, an instrumental creative force behind Bungie\u2019s trilogy, was brought in last August to help carry Halo Infinite over the finish line). You are, once again, a seven-foot-tall supersoldier palling around with a vivid blue artificial intelligence on a ring-shaped space station, hoping to save the galaxy from zealously religious extraterrestrials. We\u2019ve all seen Hollywood bungle fan service. Halo Infinite nails it by including winks and nods for more than the sake of winking and nodding. These moments are genuinely thrilling on their own merits, and never overstay their welcome. Fan service is, apparently, more fun when you can actively engage with it.But even if you\u2019re squarely in the \u201cWhat\u2019s a Halo?\u201d camp, there\u2019s a whole lot to like about Halo Infinite. The shooting is a blast, thanks to a deep bench of enemy classes and an even deeper arsenal of creative weapons, supplemented by a Bond-worthy kit of toys to play with; key among them is a grappling hook, an item that, frankly, should just be in every video game. Amid a trend of open-world games valuing quantity over quality\u2014of tossing the player into worlds cluttered with bland, repetitive tasks\u2014Infinite\u2019s open-world section feels refreshingly focused. All this, plus it\u2019s more polished than most games created at this scale. And, to finally put to bed last year\u2019s infamous graphics debacle (hi, Craig), Infinite is stupefyingly gorgeous.In other words, the question isn\u2019t if Halo Infinite is any good. It is. What\u2019s most worth measuring here is twofold: Was it worth the wait? And does this mean Halo is really, truly back?Of course, the expected wait for Halo Infinite was unexpectedly slashed by several weeks. You probably already know the broad strokes: On November 15, the 20th anniversary of Halo: Combat Evolved, developer 343 Industries surprise-released Infinite\u2019s multiplayer mode on Xbox and PC ahead of its planned December 8 debut. It\u2019s technically \u201ca beta,\u201d but c\u2019mon, can you name a recently released beta as smooth? Plus, you can already spend hundreds of dollars of very real real-world money on it. Make no mistake: Halo Infinite is already out.In fact, you may have already spent many (many) units of life\u2019s most ephemeral currency, time, playing it. Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer mode, in a first for the decades-old series, is wholly free-to-play. (The campaign is available for a standard $60 or as part of a $10-a-month Game Pass subscription.) As with most games based on such a model, you can supplant your avatar, a 26th-century supersoldier known as a Spartan, with various cosmetic options that cost varying amounts of actual money. That\u2019s in addition to an industry de rigueur battle pass, which begets sweeter and more frequent rewards if you spring for the premium version.The entire model has sparked some cacophonous feedback, to which 343 Industries has introduced marginal changes in response, an ever-evolving process unfolding in real time that we\u2019ve documented extensively here at Kotaku. If there\u2019s debate to be had about Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer portion, you\u2019ll find it there, squarely on its progression system and cosmetic offerings. Infinite\u2019s fundamentals\u2014the guns, the gear, the maps, the modes\u2014have received near-universal praise, a dominant opinion I\u2019m in personal lockstep with.Multiplayer shooters live and die by the strength of their guns. In addition to remixed versions of about a dozen-ish classic Halo firearms, like the rapid-fire assault rifle and burst-fire battle rifle, there are a dozen-ish more that are totally new to the series. A single-shot sniper rifle fires spike projectiles that kill enemies in one hit, even if you nail someone in the foot; another shoots electric rounds strong enough to short out tanks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0dbb08a9-e9a9-485a-9efb-5236add156a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0dbb08a9-e9a9-485a-9efb-5236add156a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "3589a3a1-b34f-47ae-a330-f7017c14fbd1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b6d2cc134fdba2f4bb50af7c329703bd81134bf637ca93698112b52271d83eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "438985e6-5807-4354-b33d-4e359b075fc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4b2c7f1f0096a07dffe852b4a62f136ec8524f5dcb03078b76592a299abf96d"}}, "hash": "fe01f7606665535eb7adbf7d3cd47541c708f2f785eb62d898f41ae226ecaec1", "text": "Most of these weapons, save for one\u2014a functionally useless pea shooter called the ravager\u2014are balanced to the point where you always have a fighting chance. Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer is structured such that, more often than not, victory is within grasp.Yes, there are some notable foibles (right now, for instance, you cannot choose to play deathmatches and only deathmatches, and the options for custom games are a pittance) but nothing that qualifies as a deal-breaker.For a broader critique of Halo Infinite\u2019s PvP and a deep dive into what it does (and doesn\u2019t) do right, I\u2019d urge you to check out Stella Chung\u2019s thorough multiplayer review over at IGN. Let me just leave you with one point: There\u2019s a uniquely Halo conundrum\u2014it\u2019s late, you\u2019re getting tired, you play one last match, you run the table, which feels awesome, so you say \u201cscrew it\u201d and play another round, but you totally flop, and you obviously can\u2019t go to bed all pissed off, which, uh-oh, now you\u2019re stuck in an ouroboros cycle that keeps you up \u2018til dawn (worth it)\u2014that was absent in the two recent Halo games. It is unequivocally present in Halo Infinite. My eyes, they\u2019re so bleary. They have been for weeks.Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign opens cold with Master Chief getting his ass absolutely handed to him. The UNSC Infinity, the human flagship that serves as a base of operations in Halo 4 and Halo 5, is stormed by a splinter faction of Covenant forces known as the Banished. (This faction plays a role in the 2017 real-time strategy game Halo Wars 2.) Their leader, a Brute named Atriox, beats the snot out of Chief and then...drops him into space, assuming he\u2019s KIA.The Covenant are Halo\u2019s typical cannon fodder, an allied force of various extraterrestrial species, including Grunts (small), Elites (tall), Jackals (annoying), Brutes (mean), and Hunters (very mean).This, to me, boggled the mind. You\u2019re telling me that the strong and smart leader of a savvy militant group would make the stupidest tactical mistake in history\u2014that he\u2019d just presume the death of all-time badass Master Chief instead of, I don\u2019t know, double-tapping, burning the body, and dropping the ashes in a pool of caustic acid, then inventing an interdimensional transit device and recreating the battle across the multiverse so as to guarantee no possible versions of Chief from any possible reality could come back and seek revenge? Really?Six months later\u2014and you may have seen this play out in the spine-tingling E3 2019 trailer\u2014Chief, still very much alive but floating unconscious in space, is rescued by a character known only as the Pilot. This enviably bearded man wakes Chief up (in a player-tutorial sequence that\u2019s smack out of Halo 2) and points out what the duo is next to: a Halo ring, shattered at the belt due to unknown reasons. Chief and the Pilot head down to its surface to find an artificial intelligence unit called the Weapon. Apparently, she can help them track down Chief\u2019s prior AI partner, Cortana\u2014who, you may recall, stated an intent to basically commit genocide on a galactic scale at the end of Halo 5.This intrepid trio comprises the heart and soul of Halo Infinite, what with their penchant for banter and interpersonal dynamics. The Pilot is the grounded one, constantly reacting to Infinite\u2019s abjectly bonkers events with the incredulity and unsteady resolve we\u2019d all surely feel in the same situations. Meanwhile, the Weapon, who was supposed to be deleted prior to the events of Infinite, spends much of her screentime contemplating her existence, why she\u2019s still around, and what plans got fucked up to grant her a second chance at life, giving a zippy and personal thrust of mystery to Halo Infinite.Master Chief is somewhat more of an enigma than the other two, and is the clear driving force behind the mystery at play. It\u2019s obvious from the jump that, despite you literally spending most of the game behind his eyes, he knows more than he\u2019s letting on. So this presents a bit of dissonance. Chief\u2019s not just hiding his secrets from the Pilot and the Weapon. He\u2019s also hiding them from you.Microsoft provided Kotaku with a review build of Halo Infinite on the condition that we don\u2019t reveal the \u201cultimate fate\u201d of any primary characters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "438985e6-5807-4354-b33d-4e359b075fc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "438985e6-5807-4354-b33d-4e359b075fc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "0dbb08a9-e9a9-485a-9efb-5236add156a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe01f7606665535eb7adbf7d3cd47541c708f2f785eb62d898f41ae226ecaec1"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d909927-6aa2-4730-927d-d291d5ba76d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "170847156bc002391524eb945c64fc8852abf2258ae94b2745f71be3224bd927"}}, "hash": "d4b2c7f1f0096a07dffe852b4a62f136ec8524f5dcb03078b76592a299abf96d", "text": "I won\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t dream of it, but it\u2019s irresponsible to consider Halo Infinite without acknowledging the serious emotional transformation Chief goes through.

This is the man, after all, known for such one-liners as \u201cAsking\u2019s not my strong suit,\u201d the man who stoically gives the Covenant back their bomb, the man who unflappably holds duty on a pedestal above all, unless it steps between him and his friends, at which point: watch out.Halo Infinite, however, stars a Master Chief who\u2019s in touch with his feelings. He often offers salvos of comfort and words of wisdom. At one point, he openly admits to not feeling OK, to legitimately feeling some Master Grief. Can you imagine the stoic badass space marine of the mid-2000s saying as much? Maybe I\u2019m being a bit too optimistic, borderline naive even, but it gave me a glimmer of hope that we\u2019re done once and for all with that particular era of gaming, as myopic and bleak as it was.So, what do you actually do in Halo Infinite? Pfft, simple: You shoot aliens! Of course, there\u2019s a bit more to it (you sometimes drive vehicles or press \u201cX\u201d to interact with fancy future computers) but that\u2019s the gist.Unlike every prior Halo game, Halo Infinite isn\u2019t a linear first-person shooter. But it\u2019s not an open-world shooter, either, as some pre-release chatter may have you believe. It occupies a liminal space, both linear and structured, sometimes expansive, sometimes strictly confined. (To sketch out some rough expectations: The cold open is all linear, the middle section plays out in wide-open spaces featuring a raft of optional objectives, and the final act culminates in a several-hour-long series of subsequent linear missions.)When Halo Infinite stays on rails, it feels like a time machine. Gone are the glistening landscapes of Halo 4 and Halo 5. In their place are levels set among the future-chic Brutalist structures that defined most of the original trilogy. Some combat chambers even seem lifted wholesale from the most timeless stages.Throughout the dozen-plus main missions, you play through unmistakable callbacks to some of Halo\u2019s enduring setpieces: activating a gravity lift into an alien vessel (\u201cTruth and Reconciliation,\u201d Halo 1), taking out two Hunters in a circular pavilion above an underground facility (\u201cThe Silent Cartographer,\u201d Halo 1), surviving swarms of enemies as you ride a gondola across a bottomless chasm (\u201cRegret,\u201d Halo 2), piloting a fleet of destructive vehicles while assaulting an enemy fortress (\u201cThe Ark,\u201d Halo 3), awakening a slumbering ancient foe that threatens galactic stability (lmao pick a Halo).These setpieces are punctuated by a soundtrack, composed in part by Gareth Coker of Ori and the Will of the Wisps, that seamlessly mixes Marty O\u2019Donnell\u2019s ageless score with reimagined takes on the theme. (Infinite also features original compositions.) It\u2019d be a lie to say I didn\u2019t feel instantly whisked back to 2007 when those Halo crescendos kicked in. The nostalgia here is deliriously potent.Less familiar are the open segments, though anyone who\u2019s played an open-world shooter will immediately grasp the structure. Between main missions, you can explore at will. You can rescue groups of imprisoned space marines or capture Banished operating bases. You can take out mini-bosses, each replete with their own dossier detailing a gruesome backstory. Completing these tasks grants you a chunk of XP, called Valor; every 100 (sometimes 200) Valor you earn ranks you up, unlocking new guns and other weapons, allowing you to further customize your loadouts at any operating bases you\u2019ve captured. Yes, even Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign has a battle pass of sorts. (It doesn\u2019t cost extra, don\u2019t worry.)You can further go into explorer mode and hunt down audio logs, which fill in the narrative gaps between Halo 5 and Halo Infinite, or cosmetic options for the multiplayer mode: weapon skins, armor skins, emblems, banners, and the like.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d909927-6aa2-4730-927d-d291d5ba76d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d909927-6aa2-4730-927d-d291d5ba76d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "438985e6-5807-4354-b33d-4e359b075fc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4b2c7f1f0096a07dffe852b4a62f136ec8524f5dcb03078b76592a299abf96d"}, "3": {"node_id": "69578e7a-583d-460e-949f-dfceace0f036", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e892d573e8e73f45a1aaecbeabe288a910af27410b235a83a4fe49c70520ebeb"}}, "hash": "170847156bc002391524eb945c64fc8852abf2258ae94b2745f71be3224bd927", "text": "I did not see anything on the scale of armor kits. Nor did I see what any of the cosmetic options look like, since the review copy Microsoft provided Kotaku is wholly separate from the widely available multiplayer mode, precluding me from testing them out on my avatar. The review copy will also wipe my save data a few hours after this review goes live, at which point I\u2019ll have to start the game over and hunt everything down again from scratch.I didn\u2019t avail myself of every optional activity, mostly because of that whole \u201cwiping my save data\u201d thing. But I fully plan on starting Halo Infinite from scratch\u2014on a completionist run, mind you\u2014once the retail version goes live. That, in and of itself, should tell you how engaging this stuff is.Halo Infinite shines moment-to-moment due to the suite of tools at your disposal. You get a nifty grappling hook, yes, but also a portable shield wall, a thruster, and a threat-revealing motion tracker, all of which are tied to relatively brief cooldowns. Around Infinite\u2019s world, you can find skill points to improve the efficacy of every ability.These abilities aren\u2019t mere gimmicks; surviving the most hectic firefights requires using all of them all the time, even on the standard difficulty setting. When you\u2019re pinned and on the fritz, you might have to drop a shield wall, let your shields recharge, then quickly grapple to a nearby ledge. In a dim room full of invisible enemies, you might have to deploy a threat sensor and quickly dash away from nearby foes you hadn\u2019t seen. The only thing better than a fascinating kit of gadgets is a well-designed game that forces you to use them all.As much as Halo Infinite hits a stride because of what it has, it stumbles because of what it\u2019s missing. In August, 343 Industries announced that Infinite\u2019s campaign wouldn\u2019t be playable cooperatively at launch, with the feature instead coming some time next year, an absence that is keenly felt at points. Halo is thoroughly a co-op game. Always has been. (Halo 5 was the first time the series didn\u2019t have local splitscreen, but at least it was playable cooperatively over the internet.) Going it alone suuucks, and not always just due to absent camaraderie.Hunters, imposing armored-coated space monsters with cannons for arms, are particularly maddening to face solo. Whenever I came across a pair of these fuckers\u2014Hunters always show up in pairs\u2014I audibly groaned. See, to take down a Hunter, you have to shoot it a whole bunch of times in the back. But in Halo Infinite, they can turn on a dime, and always seem to know precisely where you are. In lieu of a teammate who could serve as a distraction (thanks bro!!!), I often resorted to cheapskate tactics just to scrape by. No fun! (That Infinite\u2019s Hunters roar like Skryim\u2019s dragons doesn\u2019t make running into them any more fun.) Some of the boss fights, too, feel designed for two-player tag teams, and as such are a drag to tackle on your own.That\u2019s right: Halo Infinite is rife with boss fights. To the game\u2019s credit, none are mere bullet sponges, as you\u2019d find in comparable modern first-person shooters like Far Cry, Borderlands, Wolfenstein, or even Halo 5. Every single boss requires a distinct strategy...that, again, would be far more manageable with a partner. The invisible Elite who can kill you in a hit or two wouldn\u2019t be so frustrating if you could have one person around to set up a threat sensor and another posted in the corner to scope out headshots. The duo of turret-wielding Brutes wouldn\u2019t be such a pain if you could, funny idea here, fight them two-on-two rather than one-on-two.There\u2019s also little emotional weight to these encounters, deflating the tension of each showdown. Halo Infinite\u2019s batch of villains are a dour bunch, and not because they\u2019re all hellbent on galactic domination. (OK, maybe a little bit because they\u2019re hellbent on galactic domination.)

The mentor of Atriox, Escharum assumes the mantle of responsibility for leading the Banished on the ring\u2019s surface. But his entire modus operandi seems to be about nothing more than beating up Chief and taking his lunch money for the sheer purpose of seeing who\u2019s stronger, like an insecure kid who leans way too hard into insipid machismo.At one point, Escharum goes so far as to orchestrate a progressively tense series of arenas made out of reclaimed UNSC bases just...because? For reasons? It feels strange and petty, and also makes little logistical sense. Despite playing out on various floors of a towering Covenant structure, all of these outposts are set up on top of suspiciously Earth-looking mounds of sediment. And then there\u2019s the matter that Escharum, supposedly a seasoned military commander, actively condemns hundreds of troops to certain death in pursuit of what\u2019s effectively a pissing contest. For a game that\u2019s otherwise so attentive to the details, this sequence came across as totally out of place, as little more than a stopgap between story beats. (My tangible takeaway is that I now really hope Infinite someday adds a revived iteration of Firefight, Halo\u2019s legacy horde mode.)I kept expecting some revelation, some shocking late-game twist, to come along and justify Escharum\u2019s whole deal. It never did.Infinite\u2019s most memorable set piece isn\u2019t one of its biggest. No, it\u2019s one of its smallest: a mausoleum of whispered recordings, each a Cortana speech from Halos past. In a singular hushed-tone moment, Halo Infinite shows how, at its best, it can be both so grand and so intimate. Somewhere along development, 343 Industries wisely recognized that Halo Infinite could never escape the legacy of its predecessors, so it wholeheartedly embraced them.Last year, at a July 2020 digital showcase meant to drum up buzz for the Xbox Series X, 343 Industries pulled back the curtain on Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign, which was scheduled for release that holiday season. The blowback was swift and fierce. Much of the critique centered on what folks considered flat textures, as immortalized in a viral freeze-frame of a low-resolution Brute character model, teasingly dubbed \u201cCraig\u201d by the community. (Halo Infinite\u2019s current campaign build now has a tongue-in-cheek Easter egg referring to Craig.)Within a month, 343 delayed Halo Infinite and brought on Halo veteran Joe Staten to take the reins on developing the campaign. Chris Lee, Infinite\u2019s creative lead, left the project soon after, with Bloomberg noting that his role was \u201csidelined\u201d in the wake of Staten\u2019s onboarding.It was, in short, a messy time, but publicly at least, 343 Industries is hewing to the line that Infinite likely wouldn\u2019t have been a complete disaster even if it hadn\u2019t changed course in response to public reaction. In a recent interview with Eurogamer, Staten noted how \u201c[Halo Infinite\u2019s core design] decisions were made long before I arrived \u2026 we just spent a year doubling down on what was already great about the campaign and tried to make it even better.\u201dI haven\u2019t the faintest clue how the campaign seen in last year\u2019s showcase would\u2019ve been received, whether it\u2019d shape up as stellar as Infinite has or would\u2019ve totally missed the mark, as so many vocal observers predicted with confidence. (For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m on record saying the initial debut looked pretty good!) I don\u2019t know how the current form of Infinite will be received by newcomers, either, since it does seem to assume at least a moderate understanding of series knowledge on the part of the player. I don\u2019t know if longtime fans will love it, or if any widespread adulation will be drowned out by cynics who end up regarding Infinite as little more than a cash-grab walk down memory lane.I do know this: As a longtime Halo devotee, it is so, so good to be back to a Halo that genuinely feels like a Halo.

Is it a traditional, mainline game in the Halo franchise? Sure, yes, in most of the ways you'd quantify that, the complete Halo Infinite package checks many of the boxes you'd expect to see in a Halo game. Campaign co-op, really, is the biggest outlier there, but let's not get hung up on that particular part just yet.Is it one product? Or is it two? The multiplayer is a free-to-play release that's being called a beta at the moment, though the money they will ask you to spend on a premium battle pass and cosmetics is decidedly final, non-beta money. I've had a fantastic time with the multiplayer and happily put $50 of my own money into it to buy said battle pass, some levels on said battle pass, and an extremely sick-looking armor set for my Halo Man. It's certainly content-light if you're comparing it to an \"old,\" full-fledged, traditional console video game release, but as a seasonal product with all of the ups and downs that entails, it launched reasonably well and it seems at least somewhat likely that the game will see a lot of meaningful additions to its modes and maps lists as time goes on. Obviously, we can't review the future, so what's here right now is what it is: a little thin on its own, but still something I've happily sunk time and money into.The campaign is probably the part you're interested in hearing about, since it's the part of the game that hasn't been out until right around the time I'm writing this review. That campaign sells for $60, just like a traditional console game. Wonderful, familiar territory, easy to assign a score to and... oh, wait, it's also on Game Pass. OK, let's walk through that a bit.It is the opinion of this publication that if you own a recent Xbox console you should subscribe to Game Pass and if you also have a reasonably modern PC you should probably subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate. It's been a great collection of games both big and small. Even if Halo Infinite didn't exist, I'd still be typing this part right now to tell you to go play Forza Horizon 5. Or to check out Back 4 Blood for an hour or so before deleting it. The PC end of Game Pass has been a somewhat dicier proposition than its console counterpart, but that side of things has picked up the pace quite a bit over the last year or so, making Game Pass Ultimate a much more interesting tier of service. Oh, also you can play Halo Infinite's campaign via a Game Pass subscription. And there will be some multiplayer skins and stuff that come via the \"Game Pass Perks\" program.With all of that said... yes, you should play the Halo campaign, it has some interesting ideas that blow out the traditional Halo campaign concept with some open-world-like designs without falling into the trap of just littering your map with a bunch of bad, repetitive activities. It brings that Halo toolset to a wider arena, letting you take on some of those outdoor challenges in fun, new ways.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05be36f0-45a1-45b4-855f-efcc04f911a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "05be36f0-45a1-45b4-855f-efcc04f911a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "51ddb104-f4d5-41f4-b3c4-709c72dbf8e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "78de22cec260fcf130c50f3dee435406a8c8abfc9a62117b7497f938e02fce99"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d9239f4-17c6-4745-8d61-8a08e9a18006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0e9352c2d15237e427addaf96787f96aada447d1edbc65219641e0a0606ac77"}}, "hash": "8a3439de517f359f3331776e74d9d6da6c112a2db500a803b97524b1550d3f2d", "text": "It also brings you indoors for some extremely Halo-ass Halo levels, which look great and give you that traditional Halo experience.It also has an extremely satisfying grappling hook that makes you feel like the Master Chief has been playing a bit of Just Cause in his downtime.So what the heck am I actually reviewing here, anyway? The $60 package, the \"pay money for the campaign\" package is probably the worst way to play Halo. You'd even be better off buying a month of Game Pass, playing the campaign, and letting that lapse. So thumbs down to that full, retail-style version of the game unless you are somehow locked in a world where you refuse to play anything unless it's on Steam. I don't know why you'd live that way, but you know what? People are weird. Did I say weird? I meant extremely particular. Hey, it's your money.Video game reviews have meant a lot of things to a lot of people over the years. To me, traditionally, the scored video game review is meant to serve as some sort of helpful advice for players who are on the fence about a particular product. When there was money on the line, I wanted to be there to help. At this point, I've written well over a thousand of these things. Timely reviews of new games couldn't be beat for the first decade or so of my career. They'd sit in the top slot, the traffic would roll in, everyone was... well, maybe not happy, but at least they clicked on a thing and perhaps glanced at the last paragraph of what I had to say about a game. This was the way of the world. The games cost money, I hate to see people waste money on bad games, and me and the people I worked with on the reviews team were the people who held the line in an attempt to keep you from blowing money on bad games. Simple, right?When the game is free and the subscription service is already something I'd recommend with or without the existence of this particular game, what purpose does that type of review serve? I could sit here and crank out the typical 1,500 words about The Next Halo. Playing the games takes way longer than writing about them does; it always did. In fact, let's just do that now. I'll get back to how I think this style of video game review is deader than dead later.Halo Infinite's campaign once again puts you in the role of the Master Chief, and, unlike some previous entries, only the Master Chief. In a lot of ways, the game feels very back to basics, focusing most on the enemies and weapons that made the series famous in the first place. Where the last couple of games got bogged down by introducing a new, less exciting faction of enemies known as the Prometheans, Halo Infinite feeds you a steady diet of grunts, brutes, elites, jackals, and hunters. You'll see some fun new tricks and some new enemies along the way, of course, but a lot of this game feels like it's trying to ignore the last couple of games in service of giving you That Halo You Remember while also making everything feel bigger than it's ever been before.The story, too, takes a big sidestep by quickly introducing you to The Banished, a faction of traditional Halo enemy types that, if the numerous Halo wiki sites I've been scouring for the past few nights are correct, debuted in Halo Wars 2. While something about ditching large parts of the past two games' direction in favor of a group of old-style bad guys that came from an RTS side story might seem a whole lot like grasping at straws to try to make something the lapsed Halo fan might more readily jump at... well, the change paid off because this very much works out in the game's favor.The story itself does what it can to tie up the loose ends of the previous games, but overall, Halo Infinite doesn't seem too concerned with story at all. It thrusts you into the action, with a cutscene depicting the Master Chief being cast off into space by a large guy named Atriox. The game eventually fills in enough backstory to tell you about Atriox and his faction, the Banished, but overall, the story--particularly the parts focusing on the Banished and why they've taken over Zeta Halo--feels very light. The emotional side of Being the Master Chief and its counterpart, Being Around the Master Chief, are the focuses. Even the big events of the previous games, like Cortana lining up an army of AI allies to fight humanity, aren't really dealt with in major or especially satisfying ways.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d9239f4-17c6-4745-8d61-8a08e9a18006": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d9239f4-17c6-4745-8d61-8a08e9a18006", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "05be36f0-45a1-45b4-855f-efcc04f911a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a3439de517f359f3331776e74d9d6da6c112a2db500a803b97524b1550d3f2d"}, "3": {"node_id": "7286532f-ca4a-4c59-8513-7fccc4a15a32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3074cd329b557968087002c6ca3bfdb74fc311d54e1610555898c02c9d7197fb"}}, "hash": "f0e9352c2d15237e427addaf96787f96aada447d1edbc65219641e0a0606ac77", "text": "The game feels like it's waiting to tell you something really important, but once you get to the back third of game and start seeing something that resembles a story dump, it just doesn't have that much information for you. It spends some time talking about what it means to be this weird, armored super soldier and what it's like to be a human (or an AI hologram lady) who has to work alongside the universe's coldest Spartan. The story feels small, in a sense, and that part works decently, but it's hard to get attached to new characters like the Pilot when it feels like there's still unfinished business with a lot of other, longer-running characters.Many of the game's late story beats unfold in front of you in holographic-style flashbacks and, by the end of the game and its post-credits sequence I was left wondering things like \"wait, who was that\" and \"what did I even accomplish here, anyway?\" It feels like a game missing one or two meaningful revelations at the end.I'll put it this way: sometimes when we get games in for review, a publisher will ask nicely for us to not spoil specific moments in the game. Most of the time this is absolutely common sense stuff that you'd never really dream of just typing out in a review. In this particular case, one of the things on the Halo Infinite list is something I couldn't spoil if I tried, because despite finishing the game, I have no idea what the thing they're referring to actually is. I suppose I'll need to finish it on Legendary at some point and see if there's an extended post-credit sequence or something? Or maybe it's mentioned in some even more obscure Halo side game? Do I need to buy the books? Is the information scrawled under the pull tab on a can of Rockstar?Structurally, Halo Infinite looks like an open-world game, with its big map and little icons denoting main and side quests you can (and should) take on. But it works in phases. When you first get outside, you can run around a specific part of the map, taking over bases that serve as fast travel points, taking out high-value targets to unlock neat weapon variants, and so on. Progressing the story eventually takes you to another part of the map, locking you out of your old fast travel points from the first phase, and so on. Eventually you get your hands on a banshee, which is a flying vehicle. So, naturally, I set off in the direction of the dark part of the map that I hadn't been to yet, to see if I could, I don't know, see anything cool or play the last mission out of order or something like that. Instead, the game lets you get a bit outside of your current area, then throws up a YOU ARE LEAVING THE BATTLEFIELD SOLDIER countdown that kills you when it expires. That was a pretty disappointing thing to discover. Halo Infinite is smaller than it initially seems. That said, it's still plenty big and pretty engaging. Also, you are let back out into the world after finishing the campaign, letting you travel around a bit more unfettered to mop up things you might have missed. In a lot of ways, Halo Infinite is the game I wanted after playing Halo 3: ODST, which had a hub world of its own that brought you into a set of somewhat traditional Halo levels. But there's a part of me that can't help but think that it could have been so much more if it had gone further in the open-world direction. It feels restrained both in its structure and in its storytelling. Still an extremely cool game with some terrific visuals and a lot of exciting and meaningful moments, but sometimes it feels like it's just missing something.And I don't mean campaign co-op, though while we're here, this campaign seems like it could be extremely fun to play through with friends. The open terrain and the mobility (and hijinks) enabled by the presence of a great grappling hook seem like they'd lead to some awesome moments. I'd probably be down to replay this entire campaign once that option is made available. They say it'll happen next year. Forge is also planned to make its way into the game next year.The multiplayer side of things, then, is confined to its competitive multiplayer, which comes in two basic forms: the 4v4 small map modes and the \"big team battle\" 24-player big map modes. The big maps are where the vehicles live, and loading up a warthog full of players and getting into trouble on the other side of the map is still extremely fun.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7286532f-ca4a-4c59-8513-7fccc4a15a32": {"__data__": {"id_": "7286532f-ca4a-4c59-8513-7fccc4a15a32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d9239f4-17c6-4745-8d61-8a08e9a18006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0e9352c2d15237e427addaf96787f96aada447d1edbc65219641e0a0606ac77"}, "3": {"node_id": "463c50a2-43b5-4fd0-aab2-f6e498e57d01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d08fa2b5a3387e3997c00dcfcca53240d5c92c089c494ec0c0eac75d21ec05c6"}}, "hash": "3074cd329b557968087002c6ca3bfdb74fc311d54e1610555898c02c9d7197fb", "text": "The vehicle physics still get a little wild and loose, and again, the presence of a grappling hook only adds to the experience, letting you steal flying vehicles from a distance if you're properly equipped. The trinity of melee strikes, grenades, and guns still works as you'd expect, but the action and control feels a little peppier than it sometimes has in the past. As far as I'm concerned--and I will grant you, I am mostly a Titanfall or Call of Duty kind of guy who didn't even particularly like Halo until Halo 3 came out--this is the best competitive Halo has ever been.But as I said above, the game launched with less than a full game's worth of maps. The cosmetics are cool, but at some point in our modern, post-Fortnite world \"skins\" became pretty damned expensive. While I am alarmingly interested in being a clothes horse on the Spartan runway, spending like 20 bucks for a full set of new stuff just seems nuts. That's rapidly becoming the standard price for that sort of makeover, though, so maybe let's set this aside for the larger \"the cosmetics are too damn high\" conversation we probably need to have.On top of that, the game launched with an absolutely absurd progression system that only rewards you battle pass XP for completing. So playing the game properly--you know, heady concepts like trying to win or playing the objective modes as if they are objective modes instead of just yet another team deathmatch--aren't really rewarded. There's no listed player level or other progression, either. It's just your battle pass. The challenge setup inspires people to play the game poorly because instead of trying to win, they're trying to get five kills with a disruptor pistol... and then they might just quit after getting those kills since there's no reason for them to stick it out. The developers have already made changes to this system and promise more changes are on the way, but it's still in a pretty poor state as of this writing.It's been interesting seeing some players decry Halo Infinite's split approach and instead pine for that traditional $60 package. I can't think of anything more boring than a Halo that didn't take any of these chances. While I don't think 343 hit every single target they aimed for here, they hit a lot more often than they miss, and Halo Infinite is a great time whether you're fighting it out with the Banished on the big ring or getting into the multiplayer.Just don't ask me if I think it's worth $60 or not.While I'm glad Halo went for it and trying a ton of different stuff in its gameplay, structure, and business model, there's a part of me that pines for the old days. Remember when midnight launches meant something? Absolute lunatics, waiting out all night to pick up a game and go home to play until the sun came up? Now we're pissed if a game doesn't hit at 9PM here on the west coast and anything that decides to hold until 10AM the next day means we're slapping together VPNs or changing our console region to get stuff to unlock early. Or, more accurately, we're pre-ordering games to get in the Friday before the \"real\" launch date or something insane like that. Halo Infinite doesn't have a Legendary Edition physical release, and something about that makes me sad. I have two of those stupid Halo 3 helmets in my garage and, honestly, the last thing I want is more physical stuff in my life, but... that helmet meant something, it stood out in a way that very, very few of those overpriced collector's editions ever did. It was... well, legendary, I suppose.Did that review serve its main purpose? I'm going to go ahead and say that you already knew if you were going to play Halo Infinite or not before you even clicked on this page. That's fine, and it gets into the Other Reason people read a lot of these reviews over the years. Some people just want to get in some weird online argument about something. People go out and wait for Metacritic averages and then, instead of using them to help determine if a game is for them or not, they instead try to assign some kind of big meaning to the number. It's just Ford versus Chevy, Sega versus Nintendo, Sony versus Microsoft, Apple versus Android. These divides now run all the way to the top, and I'm sure it won't be long now before some console fanboy is waiting for JFK Jr. to return and tell us which machine is better.When the games are free, we're not reviewing to help save you money. We're curating to help save you time. And this sort of information is often best conveyed in other forms.

As games get bigger and bigger, as the medium spreads further and further, the game-specific publication is only for the diehards, even if some of the largest sites are still cruising off of SEO advantages and spending more time working on Black Friday gift guides stuffed with affiliate links than actual coverage of video games. Those diehards--you diehards--don't need your hands held the same way people did 25 years ago. You don't need me to sit here and put together my best game picks for \"dads and grads\" for some suck-ass gift guide. Those people all play games now, too. You've already consumed enough information about an upcoming game to know most of what you need to know before it's out. All you really want to know is... does it live up to the hype? Again, you don't need a score or a review to actually answer that question.So it's well past time for us to leave the \"product review\" behind. Duh, right? I realize that, as I'm typing this, we haven't reviewed a game in over a year. And that plenty of other publications have made this same move. Also, I don't want you to get it twisted--I'm not talking about critical writing. I'm not talking about actual criticism and the act of putting these games through their paces in search of some cultural context. That sort of writing is only getting more interesting, even if some meatheads like to get very salty the minute an author starts talking about a game's place in the larger world we all inhabit. But that sort of writing isn't necessarily the old \"timely reviews that tell you if you should buy it or not\" formula that I'm talking about here.I've been meandering down this road since 2019, when Microsoft put out Crackdown 3, of all things. A bad game, but when it's part of a good subscription service, you might as well at least check it out, right? At the time, the idea that a bad, two-stars-at-best game like Crackdown 3 was still something that I could shrug off and say \"I mean hey, give it a shot, you might as well, right?\" felt like shoe #1. Halo Infinite is shoe #2. One of the biggest franchises from gaming's modern era now shows up in two spots, one free-to-play, the other via a subscription. You don't need me to do this anymore. There are better avenues for me to talk to you about the relative quality of new video games than this one. Whether it's in an existing format or in an all-new one, this whole thing needs to change to better serve you, the modern video game enthusiast.Overall, Halo Infinite is great but something of a mixed bag. Fans of the genre will certainly enjoy the additional mobility granted by the grappling hook while the rest of the gameplay delivers that well-polished Halo experience that shooter-heads have come to know and love over the decades. It's a bit of a shame that the story doesn't quite stick the landing, but add in the fantastic (and free) multiplayer and you've got a really solid foundation for whatever comes next, be that a story expansion or an eventual full-on sequel.\u00a9 2023 FANDOM, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\nUse your keyboard!Log in to comment\nDestructoid, darkSo I\u2019ve talked about my extensive history with\u00a0Halo\u00a0already in our Halo Infinite multiplayer review. This is the first major Halo game in six years, let\u2019s get right into it!Halo Infinite (PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S [reviewed on an Xbox Series X]) Developer: 343 Industries Publisher: Microsoft Released: December 8, 2021 MSRP: $60 (Included with Game Pass) After\u00a0Halo 5, Master Chief is rescued and resuscitated from the depths of space, and has a job to do.\u00a0Halo is notorious for cliffhangers, but the payoff for this one, and how Chief recovers from unrelenting odds and forges ahead sets the stage for Infinite\u2018s forward momentum. This is a\u00a0Halo fan\u2019s\u00a0Halo game. Forget that it has the perceived trappings of a modern open-world setup, as it doesn\u2019t detract from the core message in the slightest: which is, of course, to wreck stuff, and blow it up, if possible.Far from a reboot,\u00a0Halo Infinite continues the story of past games, but it does feel like a soft reset.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08f12d09-cd84-494b-95b0-2585e5d057cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "08f12d09-cd84-494b-95b0-2585e5d057cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "463c50a2-43b5-4fd0-aab2-f6e498e57d01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d08fa2b5a3387e3997c00dcfcca53240d5c92c089c494ec0c0eac75d21ec05c6"}, "3": {"node_id": "35156fb4-9275-4543-b51e-95997141ec0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d9d2af9c77398d90fb02d5a6640317e0bb131475cd7fd2cf73040ed5a6c60ae"}}, "hash": "a941088eb56a49e197a3f3567833581a3b320edc2c31c19a846f504e0021dc15", "text": "Cortana, Zeta Halo (the game\u2019s world/setting), the Banished: all of these things are thrown around, and explained as you play. Chief comes back online and meets a lonely pilot, and immediately learns that he needs to take on more aliens to avoid some bad outcome. It\u2019s how things go! It\u2019s what he does.Sometimes it\u2019s rather cartoony in nature how much you\u2019ll need to blow things up, which is a compliment. This is an arena action shooter at heart, and you\u2019re destroying everything to a fantastic soundtrack as a one-man army. This is all-Chief-all-the-time, which is going to delight a lot of people who were tired of side stories of other Spartans. We\u2019re back to basics.I should say up front that the open world does not suck. After a few intro missions elsewhere, Chief and his pilot are thrown into Zeta Halo, which has a world map. From there, you can wander around, collect stuff, kill stuff, go conquer forward operating bases (FOBs) which highlight more stuff and create fast travel points, or run to critical path missions (which have a cutscene transition and often take place in a bunker or structure).Okay, so there\u2019s a lot to unpack here. My first inkling was to think of FOBs like radio towers, but they\u2019re almost nothing alike. So in your typical Ubisoft game (or pretty much any pin-filled open-world-busywork game now), you head to radio towers like it\u2019s a part-time job, then piss off and never visit them again, as their purpose is to just be scaled and forgotten. But FOBs actually are bases, offering up chances to spawn vehicles, weapons of choice, and take troops along for the ride: the power of which is measured by your valor rating, which is like a side XP hustle.During all the FOB capturing and usage of all of the above, I never once felt like they were rote tasks to be completed. They felt like an organic part of the game, completely lacking in the cynicism of modern open-world game design. Halo Infinite succeeds because it doesn\u2019t lose sight of its roots and never really tries to be something different. With that aim, it\u2019s actually a breath of fresh air.Campaign missions are also very traditional, and some of the transitions between open-world play and said missions are noticeably flashy. Yes, a lot of them are in the literal bunkers I mentioned earlier, cordoned off from the map, but the ones that aren\u2019t feel that much more imposing when you can look in the background and see the giant mountains of Zeta Halo. Again, the open world works in Halo Infinite\u2018s favor pretty much at all times.In terms of fundamentals, we already talked about some gameplay mechanics in the multiplayer review, but suffice to say they\u2019re translated wonderfully to the campaign. Here, you have access to power-ups whenever you want on a strict cooldown, as they\u2019re unlocked. Smartly, Master Chief can use an unlimited grappling hook right at the start (again, on a cooldown, which can be upgraded), eventually gaining access to a quick dodge (that can add charges), a projectile radar, and a deployable shield.While the control system to swap between them is cumbersome at first (and requires several d-pad presses), you eventually get used to it, and the potential for style videos is all the better for it. Swapping between a grappling hook, clambering up a ledge, punching a grunt in the face, then quick-dodging a barrage of energy grenades is satisfying. The potential here for Master Chief to be badass is at an all-time high, and the amount of weapons in the game doesn\u2019t feel too overwhelming \u2014 notably because a few of them are reworked clones of each other with more power and a different paint scheme.That\u2019s in part because 343 isn\u2019t above re-using some things in the campaign, a tactic that\u2019s subtle at first, but becomes more obvious as you progress. One unfortunate byproduct of this is a completely re-used boss fight, among several minibosses that do not feel unique in the slightest: a Borderlands-esque \u201cit\u2019s this unit, but it looks a little different\u201d move. This also extends to some of the aforementioned bunker zones in core missions, which are sometimes a little too similar with their layouts.When these moments happened, I let out an audible groan. But during the course of the campaign and all of my open-world mucking about, it wasn\u2019t a constant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35156fb4-9275-4543-b51e-95997141ec0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "35156fb4-9275-4543-b51e-95997141ec0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "08f12d09-cd84-494b-95b0-2585e5d057cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a941088eb56a49e197a3f3567833581a3b320edc2c31c19a846f504e0021dc15"}, "3": {"node_id": "c63c325f-3bbf-4cb1-98a1-95598c661b0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5f13197cbe0a475a7c74a394f678d22a2705d7547feec62a752c0710251154c"}}, "hash": "2d9d2af9c77398d90fb02d5a6640317e0bb131475cd7fd2cf73040ed5a6c60ae", "text": "There\u2019s plenty of variety there, just be warned that not all of the campaign is gold. Of course, the elephant in the room is worth mentioning: no co-op at launch is a crying shame.It feels\u00a0outright wrong to not play a\u00a0Halo game with split-screen co-op on day one, and I have to lament the lack of it, as this would be a really kickass co-op campaign. The way FOBs work with the loadout system and vehicle drops would provide an endless amount of fun with friends: roaming around at your leisure and killing stuff on higher difficulty settings. The moment 343 launches the co-op update, I\u2019m getting friends together.In the meantime, exploring the open world is fun even solo. The unlocks are innocuous enough, in the sense that you can complete the game on normal without having to worry about \u201cXP\u201d or even basic upgrades, so long as you can handle a battle rifle, figuratively speaking. There\u2019s cosmetics that feed into multiplayer unlocks, said ability upgrade cores, and a few things to find. There\u2019s also sidequests, several of which are like miniature dungeons where you blow more stuff up. There\u2019s barely any downtime in\u00a0Halo Infinite, even if you\u2019re doing random things.While we covered multiplayer extensively already, it\u2019s important to at least mention it again before we close up shop on the launch version of\u00a0Halo Infinite. So in theory, it\u2019s glorious. All of the same arena shooter foundation translates well, and the moment-to-moment gameplay is great. I just hope they continue to iterate on the reward system, because it really has the potential to be the best multiplayer on the market with a few tweaks. Bit by bit, we\u2019re getting there. Slowly.If I had one piece of advice for people on the fence with\u00a0Halo Infinite, it would be to not worry about the open world and embrace how it\u2019s handled here. I was incredibly worried at first that 343 wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the siren\u2019s song of other major publishers, but the restraint here is appreciated. This is an extremely 2021\u00a0Halo, and I think it\u2019s going to win over both lapsed players and diehards.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.

Its free-to-play multiplayer launched ahead of its planned release date, with 343 Industries providing the full experience\u00a0\u2014 albeit in beta form\u00a0\u2014 in November.

Master Chief once again leads the story, tormented by the loss of Cortana but now with a new, incredibly similar A.I. companion in the form of the Weapon. The pair look to unravel the mysteries of this new Halo ring, setting off to foil the plot of the villainous Escharum and his horde of Banished, a mercenary off-shoot of the Covenant who defeated the UNSC and took control of Zeta Halo in the process.Zeta Halo\u2019s semi-open world is peppered with a small selection of different objectives. There aren\u2019t traditional side missions here, so you\u2019ll mostly be routinely traveling to your next main mission, though there are different collectibles to find and Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) to take over. When captured back from the Banished, these FOBs allow you to spawn in vehicles and weapons on the fly, while new equipment can be unlocked as you progress. My go-to tactic is to spawn in a Razorback and pick up the NPC UNSC soldiers roaming the base, who are surprisingly handy at taking down enemies from their vantage point in your vehicles. While a co-op campaign mode has been delayed until after launch, the friendly A.I. is relatively adept, and although they aren\u2019t crucial to victory it\u2019s certainly helpful (and very\u00a0fun)\u00a0to bring a few soldiers along for the ride.The many who have already played Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer offering will be familiar with many of the weapons here, though there are a number of variations you can pick up across Zeta Halo. These add an extra twist to existing guns\u00a0\u2014 for instance, the sniper rifle can be granted an additional shock effect\u00a0\u2014 that can then be accessed from any FOB. Compared to other Halo entries that were typically dominated by one or two weapons, the useability of so many of the guns here is a big step up. Covenant weapons, in particular, are more viable than they\u2019ve ever been, with the Pulse Carbine routinely being my go-to. There are still plenty of tweaks I\u2019d like to see\u00a0\u2014 the ammo for power weapons such as the rocket launcher and energy sword is way too low, both in single-player and multiplayer\u00a0\u2014 but I found myself switching between weapons I\u2019d have turned my nose up at in previous games.The Banished are the real star of the show here, though. Halo has struggled with the direction of its villains since the fall of the Covenant in Halo 3, but the Banished make a lot of sense as a disillusioned clan of ex-Covenant criminals, while they\u2019re also immensely satisfying to fight. By planting Halo combat in an open space, Infinite gets to showcase the immense variety in enemies the series has when compared to other FPS franchises. Within a few minutes, Master Chief can be disposing of a herd of Grunts, taking down a long-range Jackal sniper, firing explosives at a heavily armored War Chieftain, and desperately trying to get eyes on a camouflaged Elite wielding an energy sword. This is complemented by the Chief\u2019s new suite of abilities, including a grappling hook, deployable shield, thrusters, and a tactical sensor, which Infinite asks you to take full advantage of given how challenging many of these enemy encounters can be.But while the Banished are tons of fun to fight across Zeta Halo, they lack a compelling face of their movement. Escharum is the main antagonist here, a mean\u00a0Jiralhanae War Chief who takes over from the previously established Atriox. However, it\u2019s unclear why this change in villain was considered necessary, given that Escharum wants to simply achieve Atriox\u2019s goals with little in the way of his own character development. It all feels like an unnecessary bait-and-switch to potentially set up something bigger further down the line, a common theme throughout the game.Halo Infinite is a robust package at launch, there\u2019s no denying it, but it\u2019s also clearly a work-in-progress. The lack of co-op at launch is indicative of this, but it\u2019s also glaringly apparent when exploring Zeta Halo.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "569082a4-e88e-43d8-9489-2a7a78593ff5": {"__data__": {"id_": "569082a4-e88e-43d8-9489-2a7a78593ff5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "c63c325f-3bbf-4cb1-98a1-95598c661b0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5f13197cbe0a475a7c74a394f678d22a2705d7547feec62a752c0710251154c"}, "3": {"node_id": "f9948ddc-cb45-4994-899a-e75399a15558", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b7ecc2f309ed197cafc95c2e596e373e53e5c189f5b9c1d39fe51ced916d0a0"}}, "hash": "68516f56280b074bf9c0b99640949b363d94e017d89591611183cf848d6f33c0", "text": "The linear sections players are transported to are incredibly similar to the point where I\u2019d struggle to differentiate missions between one another\u00a0\u2014 there\u2019s no variety in locations outside of towering alien structures. Similarly, Zeta Halo may not be the biggest open-world, but it still feels pretty empty. There\u2019s little to do here outside of traveling to and from objectives, and while they\u2019re favorably clumped together, when you\u2019re not making the journey between waypoints in a vehicle it\u2019s clear how barren this landscape is.But Infinite suffers most from its work-in-progress status with its multiplayer. Though still in its beta stages, there are so many questionable design choices here that it\u2019s difficult to see a swift way out for 343 Industries. Much has been made of its woeful progression system, which doesn\u2019t give players XP for anything related to their personal performance. 343 made amendments post-launch to give players more XP for simply playing matches, though XP is still predominantly earned by completing arbitrary challenges. XP is then used to level up the Battle Pass, which contains a selection of predominantly dull cosmetics, alongside an overpriced storefront where players can spend upwards of $15 to make their Spartan armor white.Then there are the playlists, which are a random selection of mostly objective-based modes. 343 has stated that it is working on introducing Slayer-based playlists, but again, there\u2019s no set ETA on when this will happen, and it\u2019s curious why Team Slayer wasn\u2019t prioritized at launch when it\u2019s the most popular game type. Playing objective-based modes with strangers can be an enormous headache, and I\u2019ve lost count of the number of matches where my teammates are refusing to stick to the plan.343 Industries seem committed to making improvements across the board here, remaining communicative with players that it will look to resolve these problems after the holiday break\u00a0\u2014 a commendable decision to not force their workers into crunch, as is so prevalent in the gaming industry. However, this means that Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer is yet another game that has launched with the promise of eventually being something special, rather than being greatly enjoyable right out of the gate. There\u2019s still lots of fun to be had here\u00a0\u2014 Big Team Battle can be wonderful chaos, the high TTK is a refreshing change of pace for the genre, and it all feels comfortingly Halo-y\u00a0\u2014 but there are so many little frustrations that it makes me want to put it down and wait until its issues have been resolved.And therein lies the inherent issue with launching Halo Infinite as a platform for the Halo series. It\u2019s clear that there\u2019s tons of potential here, and there\u2019s so much to love about what 343 Industries has already introduced, but playing it at launch feels like you\u2019re playing the worst version of what could rightly wind up being a fantastic game. Game Pass lets subscribers experience games like Halo Infinite on a whim, and it also lets developers like 343 take risks on launching a \u201cHalo platform\u201d that\u2019s a work-in-progress. Currently, its single-player campaign is fun if somewhat empty, while its multiplayer flickers between exhilarating and frustrating. With the former being available on Game Pass while the latter is free-to-play, it\u2019s not much of a gamble to just play it despite its problems, but by now I think we all miss when games felt like they were finished at launch.8Paul Tamburro is Editorial Manager at Evolve Media and an Editor-in-Chief of GameRevolution, ComingSoon, PlayStation LifeStyle, and SuperHeroHype.Share article\nForbes, Halo InfiniteFew games have had a release saga quite like Halo Infinite, which began as an Xbox Series X/S launch game, was delayed a year, then surprised everyone when 343 released its free-to-play multiplayer mode three weeks early.But this week marks the launch of the Halo Infinite campaign, which by itself costs either $60, or more than likely, a Game Pass membership to access. And it\u2019s the first fully new Halo since 2015\u2019s Halo 5, 343\u2019s third stab at making Bungie\u2019s series fully their own.This time around, things are different. Like Halo multiplayer has evolved into free-to-play, the Halo Infinite campaign has embraced a separate trend, an open world. Master Chief now has a sizable chunk of a Ring to explore, though married to plenty of traditional, linear campaign missions along the way.The experiment, I\u2019d say, produces mixed results. And what started out as effectively total enthusiasm at the outset slowly morphed into wishing the back half of the game had delivered more.Tons of stuff works here, to be clear.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9948ddc-cb45-4994-899a-e75399a15558": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9948ddc-cb45-4994-899a-e75399a15558", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "569082a4-e88e-43d8-9489-2a7a78593ff5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "68516f56280b074bf9c0b99640949b363d94e017d89591611183cf848d6f33c0"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3cd9e49-3f9b-454c-ae95-9e5cef540bc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "58afd30ee9684596de2e3251f64351bfef2c4e847d39c0d28153725a1c1a5e04"}}, "hash": "9b7ecc2f309ed197cafc95c2e596e373e53e5c189f5b9c1d39fe51ced916d0a0", "text": "If you are a fan of Halo\u2019s current \u201cfeel\u201d in multiplayer, that translates seamlessly to into single player here. Far and away, the best new addition to the series is the grappling hook, perhaps not a new gaming concept in general, but when combined with Master Chief\u2019s usual gameplay? It\u2019s exceptional, from grabbing weapons and explosive barrels to toss, to hooking enemies so they fall victim to an upgraded absurd AOE slam move in the late game, it\u2019s always hard to take off. That\u2019s actually my only real complaint about it, that it feels so essential, it makes all the other gadgets feel somewhat dim by comparison, and much more situational.Many elements of the open world work well. Master Chief is meant to take back the Ring from the Banished, but we\u2019re going Far Cry-lite here. There are not an overwhelming amount of bases to clear or outposts to take over. Each new zone will bring more, but it\u2019s far from an icon-littered Ubisoft map. It also doesn\u2019t really feel like Far Cry or Assassin\u2019s Creed in that I\u2019d equate it more to something like Just Cause where Master Chief clearly has no \u201cstealth option.\u201dHalo InfiniteThe main enemy engagements in the wild are large bases that may have several objectives inside them, like blowing up tanks or sabotaging workshops, or VIP targets who are more in the open, but surrounded by private armies. Kill them, and their special weapon variant will appear at your Forward Operating Bases.These bases allow you to get more and more supplies as you clear more of the map, and allow for easy fast travel. You may start with a FOB that only gives you a pistol, AR and Mongoose, but by the end you\u2019ll have every weapon you could ask for, tanks, planes and a small battalion of marines who will follow you into battle.FOBs are sort of odd, however, given the reality of the situation on the ground. Short of the WASP you get at the end, the map is not especially easy to navigate in a vehicle. 90% of the time it\u2019s faster simply to grappling hook around the map, especially in a world full of such verticality, while your other vehicles will get stuck on any tree or rock they come across. This is the conceit of the open world, where previous Halo games would design an entire level based around vehicle play, that\u2019s rarely the case here. And in terms of the FOB\u2019s weapons, those are fine until you run out of ammo, which will be quickly, and a key part of Halo has always been the ability to adapt using weapons you loot on the fly. That said, some OP weapons, like a rocket with a tracking upgrade, were must-haves every time I left a base, as they could take down VIP targets by themselves.Elsewhere, you can explore to get more skill points to upgrade your gadgets, as you do have a bunch of besides the grappling hook. You\u2019ve already used some in multiplayer like the enemy scanner or the pop-up shield, but here they can be upgraded with new abilities. One that ends up being pretty silly by the end is a dash that makes you invisible for four seconds every time you use it.One controversial collectible is going to be the multiplayer gear caches. The first time I went through and found these, I thought I was assembling a new armor set, but when I stopped to read the fine print, I realized I was only collecting things like coatings and trinkets, not actual armor pieces. If the campaign is hiding an actual set, I couldn\u2019t find it during my first playthrough.Halo InfiniteThe open world is only a portion of the campaign though, and a more traditional Halo experience is buried within it. Yes, there are a couple \u201cdo the things in any order you want\u201d moments as you blow up a trio of AA guns or deactivate some shield thing at separate generators, but the vast majority of campaign missions will have you going into some big enemy building or underground territory, and battling through linear rooms of enemies and the occasional boss. There are very few new enemy types here, and nearly everything is your traditional Grunt/Jackal/Brute/Elite combo, and of course, the sections with two lumbering Guardians. I did find some of the boss battles interesting, as those make very strong use of your equipment, whether it\u2019s tracking an invisible Elite with an insta-kill sword or dodging out of the way of a Gravity Hammer-wielding miniboss.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3cd9e49-3f9b-454c-ae95-9e5cef540bc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3cd9e49-3f9b-454c-ae95-9e5cef540bc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9948ddc-cb45-4994-899a-e75399a15558", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b7ecc2f309ed197cafc95c2e596e373e53e5c189f5b9c1d39fe51ced916d0a0"}, "3": {"node_id": "14c9d472-edd3-473f-8571-3d9188380f21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8994260a55d121b81388e4ede7f217597d1513b8db70ff0671baed35646b866"}}, "hash": "58afd30ee9684596de2e3251f64351bfef2c4e847d39c0d28153725a1c1a5e04", "text": "No FOB vehicles or guns to help you with them.My main problem with Halo Infinite is that the longer I played, the more things started to bother me.You will eventually realize that this Ring map is not going to have multiple biomes. If you\u2019ve seen the screenshots and preview footage of the campaign, you\u2019ve kind of seen it all, past the occasional plane graveyard. It\u2019s very green and full of those hexagonal Forerunner pillars and it never stops being that. The same can be said for a lot of the indoor mission zones which lack any real visual identity.You\u2019ll also notice I\u2019ve gotten this far without mentioning the story or the characters, and there\u2019s a reason for that. No, it\u2019s not the embargo that really does not want me to share nearly anything about the plot (we are trying to find out what happened to Cortana and remove the Banished from the Ring, is about all I can say), but rather I really, really disliked your only two allies in the game, which makes for a tough time.Halo InfiniteI do not like The Pilot, who carts you around and remains unnamed until the very end. He is constantly complaining and second-guessing Chief at every turn, even though you\u2019re the Master Chief and he is some random guy no one could care less about. He gets himself into trouble, we have to risk the mission to get him out of it, and he\u2019s still complaining most of the time.The Weapon is not much better, our new AI companion who is full of her own secrets, and yet has an exceptionally obnoxious sunny personality that will make you miss Cortana as much as actual Master Chief does. She either acts like a na\u00efve child or a petulant child, depending on the moment, and if the game is trying to forge some bonded trio of friendship between her, the pilot and Chief by the end, it simply does not work for me. The multiplayer AIs are all better than her.\u00a0Even Chief himself feels somewhat dated these days. He has some good one-liners as ever, but that\u2019s about all he has in terms of a personality. He\u2019s worse now than he\u2019s been previously without Cortana to bounce off, as like the player, he spends most of his time being annoyed by his two new companions. My favorite characters were actually the random Grunts and Brutes that would call me a coward when I showed up in a Ghost or made fun of me for running if I took cover. They had more personality than any of the main characters.Without question, my biggest disappointment was with the final third of the game and its ending. I will not spoil any plot points here, but I think the game ends on too big of a cliffhanger for its own good, and I think most players will be surprised at the point they pick to cut the story off. It makes the entire thing feel like an epilogue to Halo 5, or a prologue to Halo 6, not really its own fleshed-out story experience. I know that it will not be another 6 years until more Halo story content, and there are going to be more frequent updates with Infinite as a \u201cplatform base,\u201d but in this first chapter, I think most players will be displeased when it stops, considering we have no idea when it will pick up again.Past that, outside of the story developments, I was stunned when I realized that an entire third of the map you see from the beginning is not actually explorable. The final section, which you would assume you\u2019d unlock like you do the other areas, is\u2026nothing. It is a place where a few final linear story missions take place, but it is not an explorable zone with more bases or VIPs or FOBs or collectibles. Trying to fly over to it will get you an out of bounds message. I was shocked to realize this, and that leaves Infinite\u2019s map feeling somewhat small and unfinished in my mind.I also think Halo Infinite will be deeply hurt the lack of co-op. I can easily see how much fun it would be to pump the game up to Legendary, load up at an FOB and go tear stuff up in the world. But the inability to squad up and do that, especially when co-op is such a core part of the Halo experience, feels very bad. I suppose it\u2019s reason to return to the game in 6+ months when co-op finally does arrive, but it absolutely feels like something it should have launched with.Halo Infinite might be the best campaign 343 has done, but considering I didn\u2019t love the last two, I\u2019m not sure how much weight that carries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14c9d472-edd3-473f-8571-3d9188380f21": {"__data__": {"id_": "14c9d472-edd3-473f-8571-3d9188380f21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3cd9e49-3f9b-454c-ae95-9e5cef540bc1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "58afd30ee9684596de2e3251f64351bfef2c4e847d39c0d28153725a1c1a5e04"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd05b245-b196-4816-b869-a52363760673", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "80b968c6328941025ec9f7f3255cc71f1601b4c8f1bbd5f21663b7b7e302be36"}}, "hash": "e8994260a55d121b81388e4ede7f217597d1513b8db70ff0671baed35646b866", "text": "Halo Reach remains the gold standard for me in that department, and while I had a lot of fun here zipping around the open world, and I can see the potential of the concept, something about Infinite feels small and unfinished to me compared to both other Halo campaigns, and other open world titles.

Login NowHalo Infinite is 343 Industries' third entry in the franchise and the team manages to deliver one of the best Halo experiences to date.Halo Infinite is a crowning achievement for 343 Industries. The game manages to utilize elements from Halo 4 and Halo 5, namely the story beats and improved movement, while also digging deep into its roots to offer up an experience that feels like it belongs among the original series. Not only does the multiplayer feel like a return to form, the campaign, with its rich mysteries and tear-jerking story, stands tall as one of the best in the series. Halo Infinite is a return to greatness.To say I am a fan of the Halo franchise would be an understatement. From the launch of the original Xbox, I was standing in line at midnight for every Halo title in order to play the campaign as soon as possible. I devoured the novels and dove into the lore. Halo\u2019s story, for me, is one of the most important parts of the experience. Halo Infinite manages to connect together 20 years of history while remaining laser-focused on the present, which includes new relationships, the oppressive threat of the Banished, and the mystery of Zeta Halo.To draw a line between Halo Infinite and the previous titles, it evokes memories of Halo: Combat Evolved\u2019s mysteries and sense of discovery as you explore a Halo ring. It utilizes similar voiceover storytelling seen in Halo 3 (albeit without the groan-inducing slowdown). And it\u2019s got an emotional core that rivals Halo Reach.The narrative explores what it means to be a soldier, what it feels like to follow orders, or do what you think is right. There\u2019s an undercurrent of growth and trust, of coming to terms with who Master Chief is, not just as a soldier, but as a person who has only known one thing in life: fighting.While it does draw upon the history of the franchise, the past stories act as a foundation that also uplifts what 343 Industries has delivered; which is a masterful narrative that beautifully encapsulates the relationship between the characters. It\u2019s a heartfelt story that had me choking back tears as the credits rolled.To paint a clearer picture, Halo Infinite\u2019s story follows Master Chief, a new AI called the Weapon, and the Pilot as they try to stop the Banished from controlling and using Zeta Halo. Beyond this, they must also pursue the Harbinger to stop whatever it is she\u2019s doing, as well as work out the status of Cortana.Though the story is the thread that will pull you through the game, Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign is unique and offers more than just the narrative to keep you playing after the credits roll. The reason for this is that Halo Infinite is an open world game.When it was first hinted that Halo Infinite would be an open world game, I was nervous, having grown weary of the genre and games that tout it as a selling point. However, I am pleased to report that it just works with Halo Infinite. Part of why it works is due to the fact it\u2019s an entirely new direction the series has taken and it fits within the theme and mission parameters we\u2019ve seen in previous titles.Take for instance the second mission of Halo: Combat Evolved, called Halo. This mission has the Chief trekking across the ring, searching through Forerunner structures, and saving groups of marines. Halo Infinite does this, but on a grander scale.At one point in the campaign, I finished a mission and noticed a marker appear on my map about two kilometres away.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd05b245-b196-4816-b869-a52363760673": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd05b245-b196-4816-b869-a52363760673", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "14c9d472-edd3-473f-8571-3d9188380f21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8994260a55d121b81388e4ede7f217597d1513b8db70ff0671baed35646b866"}, "3": {"node_id": "f421bc7d-c7a4-433e-a008-eece201f4dfe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "246e60ced584b5a3917a9caf8661f3b3dffb74cf889956d6c7509ffafaa2577b"}}, "hash": "80b968c6328941025ec9f7f3255cc71f1601b4c8f1bbd5f21663b7b7e302be36", "text": "I started driving off in a Warthog that I found flipped on the side of a path, took out a group of Banished as I crossed a bridge, and then bailed out to climb up a mountain that looked enticing.As I used my grappleshot to pull myself up the rock, the Weapon (the AI that operates within Chief\u2019s suit) notified me that there was a group of marines down the hill that could use my help. So I leapt from the top of the mountain, landed on the ground (shoutout to no fall damage) and fought alongside a squad \u2013 it was basically a scene straight out of the novels.Moments like these repeated as I picked which icon on Halo Infinite\u2019s map I wanted to track down next. Some of the icons hint at the location of a collectible (like a skull or multiplayer cosmetic item), a high value target that has a modified version of a weapon you can unlock (like a rocket launcher with a tracking module), or a Banished-controlled territory you can clear out and claim. Any time you complete one of these, you will earn a bit of Valor, an XP system that ranks up your Forward Operating Bases \u2013 a great addition to the franchise.These Forward Operating Bases, or FOBs as they\u2019re called in-game, are UNSC bases that are controlled by the Banished. Once you clear out those pesky foes, it will once again be a human-occupied base that you can use as a fast travel point, to call in any human-made vehicle, or even request weapons you\u2019ve unlocked. As you earn Valor, the FOBs will improve, granting you access to bigger and better vehicles and weapons. The FOBs are also where you\u2019ll find marines (who also gain improvements) that will jump into your Warthog for missions and adventuring.Another open world mechanic featured in Halo Infinite is an upgrade system. The Master Chief now has access to four types of equipment in the campaign. There\u2019s the grappleshot that can pull you to distant locations or items to you, the portable shield known as the drop wall, thrusters that can move Chief laterally in the blink of an eye, and the threat detector which will highlight enemies within its sphere. By collecting Spartan Cores hidden around the world, you can improve these tools to offer better cooldowns or provide additional effects.I personally had a blast swapping through these on the fly with a press of the D-pad. It\u2019s exhilarating to use the grappleshot to pull a fusion coil to yourself, and then hurl it at a Grunt, only to hot-swap to the thruster to dodge out the way of a Jackal\u2019s laser sight. The equipment manages to add to the iconic Halo dance of guns, grenades, and melee without feeling overwhelming or bogging down the flow of combat.As for the weapons, Halo Infinite introduces a wealth of new additions that each serve a distinct purpose. There\u2019s the Commando that sits between the Assault Rifle and Battle Rifle in terms of rate-of-fire and range, the Skewer which can annihilate vehicles with a giant spike, and the Sidekick, one of the best Halo pistols in a long time. The game also separates these guns into damage-based categories, including kinetic, plasma, hardlight, and shock \u2013 all of which affect shields and flesh differently.Though there are some clear winners, it\u2019s never too disheartening to run out of ammo with your favorite weapon and be forced to scavenge the battlefield for a replacement. There are always plenty of weapon caches to find, so it becomes a flow of grabbing a weapon that suits your immediate needs (that might not always be the Battle Rifle) and using it until you want to try something else.But while Halo has always been about nailing the combat and experiencing exciting, thirty seconds of fun in new ways, it\u2019s also about the moments between the combat. These are reflective moments where you can catch your breath, hear some dialog, or just soak up the views.There were times between the combat and the story where I would just walk off into the wild to see what I could find. I often found myself climbing up a mountain or to the top of a Forerunner structure, only to reach the pinnacle and be standing there in awe \u2013 and then the Halo theme song would kick in. The monks would start chanting and singing, creating an almost spiritual moment as I stared out over the sweeping terrain of the broken circle of Zeta Halo.And yet, for all the enjoyment I gained from the campaign, there\u2019s a negative that cannot be overlooked; Halo Infinite will not have co-op at launch. For those that love nothing more than to play through the campaign with a friend, it\u2019s not possible on December 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f421bc7d-c7a4-433e-a008-eece201f4dfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "f421bc7d-c7a4-433e-a008-eece201f4dfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd05b245-b196-4816-b869-a52363760673", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "80b968c6328941025ec9f7f3255cc71f1601b4c8f1bbd5f21663b7b7e302be36"}, "3": {"node_id": "398a1fe1-9d09-4a5f-aebb-c06e3ab8f849", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a095ae1b88c9e5e692005fe5d11b38a4b5e46679256482b630c3468b8b41ac87"}}, "hash": "246e60ced584b5a3917a9caf8661f3b3dffb74cf889956d6c7509ffafaa2577b", "text": "343 Industries has promised this feature will arrive sometime after Season 1, which will be around May.\u00a0Adding to this is that I couldn\u2019t discern any way to replay story missions without starting a new campaign.Despite these woes, Halo Infinite\u2019s campaign is an outstanding addition to the series. It manages to cater to veterans while still offering enough hooks to reel in new players. As for the shift to an open world format, it feels like a natural progression and I\u2019m pleased to say it works well for the franchise.The build of Halo Infinite I received for review did not include a multiplayer component. The reason for this is that Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer was released early, albeit in beta format, on November 15 as part of the Xbox 20th anniversary celebration.From my understanding, the version of multiplayer available now, is the multiplayer that exists at launch. This double-edged blade means that the experience you and I have had now will remain the same at launch, provided no additional changes are made. The good side of this doubled-edged blade is that 343 Industries has been clear with its communication. The team has already provided messaging about additional multiplayer playlists and improvements to the progression rate of the Battle Pass (though issues still persist with its design, more on that below).Given the above caveat, I want to express my deep desire to continue playing more Halo Infinite multiplayer. What has been delivered is the quintessential Halo multiplayer experience. The maps are immediately worthy of fan-favorite status. The Halo dance I mentioned above? That\u2019s alive and well within this multiplayer arena.Halo has always been about map knowledge and strategy, not twitch skills, and that shines through in Halo Infinite. The game flaunts its lengthy time-to-kill like a badge of honor \u2013 and rightly so. If you walk around a corner and get shot, there\u2019s enough time for you to reposition and potentially turn the tides of that encounter. It\u2019s a refreshing change to the astonishingly quick TTKs in other shooters.While the maps that are present feel great, there is a clear lack of OG Halo map remakes. There\u2019s no Lockout or Blood Gulch, nor a Battle Creek or Zanzibar. I can only hope that these maps make their way into the game in some form, whether it\u2019s as a remake, spiritual successor, or to provide inspiration for something that works with the new movement on offer.Another drawback to the multiplayer is the lack of multiplayer playlists. Halo: The Master Chief Collection features a plethora of options and modes for players to choose from, while Halo Infinite is limited to Quick Play, Bots, Big Team Battle, and Ranked Arena. Though there is promise of more playlists coming, it\u2019s vexing that there are so few options. This is especially true when certain Challenges demand you play specific game modes, like Oddball, and yet you\u2019ve got no control over whether you get to play that mode.For what Halo Infinite gets wrong with its multiplayer, it gets so many things right. Outside of nailing the classic feel of Halo multiplayer that veterans will appreciate, it\u2019s also approachable for new players. This thanks to the valuable addition of bots, a series first. There\u2019s also the Academy, with its tutorial, weapon drills, and training mode, which provides even more ways to ease greenhorns into the fray.I can\u2019t talk about Halo Infinite\u2019s multiplayer without addressing its Battle Pass. Going from Halo: The Master Chief Collection\u2019s Season Pass to Halo Infinite\u2019s feels like a step backwards.The team at 343 Industries worked hard to make MCC\u2019s Season Pass system more approachable by allowing players to unlock rewards in any order, provided all 10 items are unlocked before progressing to the next 10. The system rewarded players with Season Points for playing games and completing challenges. It felt good to stockpile this currency and buy items you want from whichever season you wanted.In Halo Infinite, gone is the ability to unlock whichever item you want within groups of 10. Now, players must move linearly through the Battle Pass to acquire rewards. In order to make progress, players must earn XP by either playing matches or completing Challenges. The problem with the latter is that Challenges are only for multiplayer \u2013 another step back from MCC\u2019s campaign Challenges. This means players that prefer campaign can\u2019t earn rewards in the Battle Pass unless they engage with the multiplayer.\u00a0It\u2019s disappointing that the system isn\u2019t in a more user-friendly format at launch. However, Halo Infinite multiplayer is a live service, free-to-play game, and as such, will and has received changes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "398a1fe1-9d09-4a5f-aebb-c06e3ab8f849": {"__data__": {"id_": "398a1fe1-9d09-4a5f-aebb-c06e3ab8f849", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33693cb4d1f004cb57aef09949d96cb8f7361c3d2f0049f6ddea72768d324005"}, "2": {"node_id": "f421bc7d-c7a4-433e-a008-eece201f4dfe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "246e60ced584b5a3917a9caf8661f3b3dffb74cf889956d6c7509ffafaa2577b"}, "3": {"node_id": "30d27bfe-b427-4798-a971-5ba72930b71f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f91f5ba5b73fb8227f21e09e04d52ed14dc18c86f8a60befbe7304a8404ba783"}}, "hash": "a095ae1b88c9e5e692005fe5d11b38a4b5e46679256482b630c3468b8b41ac87", "text": "The team has already implemented changes to improve the game, and judging by the turnaround of MCC since its launch in 2014, it\u2019s not outrageous to assume more improvements will come.One positive of the Battle Pass that could act as an industry-changing moment is that those who purchase the premium version will not lose it when the season ends. Players can continue to unlock the rewards they paid for long after the season has finished and another one has started.Whether the Battle Pass progression and implementation bothers you will depend entirely on your concern over the look of your Spartan and your interest in unlocking cosmetic items. But these problems extend beyond the Battle Pass and into the core customization options within Halo Infinite. There are fewer options than previous titles and the Armor Core system seems needlessly restrictive. Players are unable to have finer choice over the exact coloring of their Spartan nor can the armor permutations be easily mixed and matched. In an age where player expression and customization is king, Halo Infinite is lacking. However, for those that are more concerned about enjoying the gameplay, cosmetics are just an extra treat \u2013 but more treats is always better.Beyond the story, open world design, gameplay and multiplayer, Halo Infinite gets many other things right. For starters, the art style manages to harken back to the classic Halo visuals whilst still appearing modernized.Despite pulling back the visuals to fall more in-line with games from the past, Halo Infinite is gorgeous. Running on the Xbox Series X, the level of detail and lighting was always superb, with the internal lighting of the Forerunner structures appearing vibrant while the light from the sun shifts and softens as the time of day changes.I spent a lot of time standing in fields and on rocks, admiring the picturesque scenes. I couldn\u2019t help but take screenshots of a small lake with some Forerunner artifacts jutting out of the ground, while the ring stretched up into the sky.On the audio side of the discussion, the music in Halo Infinite is perfect. There were moments during combat that were punctuated by iconic Halo pieces that tickled the part of my brain that thrives on nostalgia.While I touched on the narrative earlier, what really sells it are the performances by the talented voice actors. Steve Downes somehow makes Master Chief seem both robotic and human at the same time. Then there\u2019s Jen Taylor, who does a phenomenal job at bringing to life the Weapon. How she delivers numerous lines throughout the campaign made my heart sing but also sent ice through my veins. It was incredible to hear the subtle differences she brought to her lines in the story \u2013 a true master.Halo Infinite also has a wealth of user-friendly features including crossplay and cross-save between Steam, Windows Store, and Xbox consoles. There\u2019s even keyboard and mouse compatibility for console users.Halo Infinite is a quintessential Halo experience. 343 Industries has managed to create a Halo that harkens back to the classics while still ensuring it feels modern without muddying the iconic feel that long-time Halo fans have come to love. For those that follow the narrative closely, the story that is told in Halo Infinite is heartfelt and emotive, and may just bring you to tears. Not only does Halo Infinite offer a return to greatness, it caps off important stories while introducing new and exciting mysteries. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to experience it in co-op at launch. And even though the multiplayer has some growing pains to work through, it remains an absolute treat to play, especially with a group of friends. Hats off to 343 Industries. The whole team should feel proud because Halo Infinite is an instant classic. Halo\u2019s back, baby!This review is based on an Xbox Series X code provided by the publisher.

So yes.\r With Halo though you don't need gamepass anyway, it's free for multiplayer, I don't even think you need Xbox live, but you can use the above method for any game really.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSweet, thank you I'll try this \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo excited to play Halo! \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf only it were out today.  Two days off and it comes out right about the time I'll be going to back to work!\t\t\t\t\nhttps://twitter.com/MintBlitz/status/1467839509291167744 \n\t\t\t\t\tDoes anyone know if this game has damage falloff? If I'm able to land a pistol shot from across the map, is it the same damage as up close?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo glad they gave this another year to perfect.  Can't wait to dive in!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAwesome review Sam!  Now I want to play through a Halo campaign for the first time ever!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWow! Thanks mate. Have you really never played one? I'd love to hear your thoughts on the story as someone who hasn't played a Halo campaign before :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t[deleted]\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI think DF's technical investigations are an important aspect of understanding and critiquing games. Though I doubt the findings will ultimately affect someone's enjoyment of Halo Infinite. At most, you might go \"Huh, that's odd\" before getting pulled back into the combat and story.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t[deleted]", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"d3bf881d-fc27-4a65-9fcf-cdaae3f6f656": {"node_ids": ["9a2c9464-686a-45fd-97aa-8b46cb247723", "da353da6-884f-446c-9c3a-bf80314fbc51", "ba3cd924-bad0-4faa-b89d-ea4ee37507e8", "efa0d227-d4fa-4afd-b223-655b256225bf", "589a865c-ac2f-45c6-91a9-ef04f3220a54", "596705a0-41bd-44ad-aec3-dc9c985ee987", "1cb48eb1-4f73-4243-acf7-97b217a27222", "78420e43-8e4d-4a46-80a8-279f3072a801", "7a327c49-5096-4e66-8fb8-65e0d5d8227e", "1443bcd1-64a2-467d-be30-41b00fc9c638", "859ef64c-3eae-4a4f-800b-f29c94fa763c", "fde4edc4-c1ff-490e-8233-cce930a93918", "4344cf96-cac8-41d1-a87d-4e90de6f005f", "e1e531ae-2cea-401c-bc92-e9b4b776da9b", "294c9b69-5adf-412d-90df-0f34aa938c87", "5e27989f-6d82-48eb-8e9b-af2e95bd372e", "dbcd73c6-a224-4762-ba7e-0fe1f6665db0", "aaf9d030-858f-4572-9607-fbf459009040", "440984e4-fe0d-43a2-adfe-c8ee6a4b5eb7", "48817f20-7eb3-4bbd-b720-cc464e70b55f", "4972d748-3a2b-4379-853f-6553bd883582", "266b2859-d9ea-4ab4-bacb-cbee4327acfa", "3589a3a1-b34f-47ae-a330-f7017c14fbd1", "0dbb08a9-e9a9-485a-9efb-5236add156a7", "438985e6-5807-4354-b33d-4e359b075fc0", "5d909927-6aa2-4730-927d-d291d5ba76d6", "69578e7a-583d-460e-949f-dfceace0f036", "51ddb104-f4d5-41f4-b3c4-709c72dbf8e4", "05be36f0-45a1-45b4-855f-efcc04f911a1", "5d9239f4-17c6-4745-8d61-8a08e9a18006", "7286532f-ca4a-4c59-8513-7fccc4a15a32", "463c50a2-43b5-4fd0-aab2-f6e498e57d01", "08f12d09-cd84-494b-95b0-2585e5d057cf", "35156fb4-9275-4543-b51e-95997141ec0d", "c63c325f-3bbf-4cb1-98a1-95598c661b0b", "569082a4-e88e-43d8-9489-2a7a78593ff5", "f9948ddc-cb45-4994-899a-e75399a15558", "b3cd9e49-3f9b-454c-ae95-9e5cef540bc1", "14c9d472-edd3-473f-8571-3d9188380f21", "dd05b245-b196-4816-b869-a52363760673", "f421bc7d-c7a4-433e-a008-eece201f4dfe", "398a1fe1-9d09-4a5f-aebb-c06e3ab8f849", "30d27bfe-b427-4798-a971-5ba72930b71f"], "metadata": {}}}}
