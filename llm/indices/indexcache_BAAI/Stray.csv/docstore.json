No\nLink: Official siteThe early novelty of playing as a cat in Stray soon gives way to a striking realisation\u2014we often behave like cats in games anyway. Particularly in platform-puzzlers like this, our first inclination is to explore, looking for unorthodox routes up the sides of buildings, say, or jumping on furniture and seeing which objects we can manipulate. Stray simply makes such activities more natural, giving us the perfect form for the job.The feel of your moggy is crucial here, and it's instantly evident how much observational work has gone into her animation. The slender ginger tabby is one of a small feline colony living in a disused industrial district long since reclaimed by nature. As the game opens, your gang waits out a storm in a concrete shelter, where you can instigate a little play fighting or mutual sniffing and smearing. These interactions are full of recognisable details\u2014the way ears flick and rotate, the stretch routines\u2014and if you like cats (as I do), Stray should have you at \"meow\".Next morning you venture out with your crew, leaves still dripping from last night's downpour. You might pause to lap at pools of water, or employ a tree trunk as a handy scratch post, in between bouts of leaping up steps and across gaps. At first it seems overly prescriptive that you can only jump when a button prompt appears on a nearby ledge, box or pipe, with a successful landing guaranteed. Yet this system is ideally suited to the litheness of an animal with measured aims, who cares not for frantic hopping but scans the environment for clearly reachable surfaces. And while there are points when Stray abuses its control by refusing to let you jump on barrels and boxes merely because they aren't part of the essential path, the overall result is a slick, satisfying loop of pause, look, leap that sustains the feline illusion.Indeed, the prowl and pounce rhythm introduced in the opening minutes could have kept me entertained for some while on its own. As it happens, though, the plot soon intervenes: a rusty pipe betrays our sure-footed avatar as she vaults a chasm, snapping under her weight to send her tumbling down then down some more into darkness. She's now stuck in much less idyllic surroundings\u2014dusty, garbage-ridden ruins. Look up and you see a distant halo of light, from which mournful meows echo down. From such innocent beginnings, it's a gut punch. I don't recall the last time I cared about a game protagonist's fate so much.What follows for the rest of the game is a journey to reach the top again, revealing the fate and legacy of an extinct humanity on the way. It seems that people built the underground city you've plummeted into because the planet surface had grown toxic, only to meet their ends regardless, long before the outside bloomed once again. All that remains are their former android servants, functioning free from direction, and hordes of nasty beasties called zurks, which look like baby headcrabs from Half-life and exist merely to chew through anything that moves.At various stages of your adventure, you'll have to pass through zurk-infested territory, usually marked by a coating of unsightly, stringy goo, as if a giant pizza had exploded. At first, the only way to survive the zurks is to run for your life, sprinting into the screen while plotting paths between streams of the squeaky blobs and weaving at speed to avoid their grasps. Later, you'll find them blocking your route and have to trick them into chasing you with taunting meows\u2014a reverse game of cat and mouse\u2014to lead them astray. None of this is especially taxing, however, and while it's certainly possible to get caught, these sections mainly serve to vary the pace between more unhurried travails.You'll also soon find a friend to give you some technological guidance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f88b5f88-9873-4c91-a9ad-698b0e3159f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f88b5f88-9873-4c91-a9ad-698b0e3159f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1ea36d6-ee1e-4c52-b699-24aadd298804", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "05d0878e65836ca29554a2de83c8b222a323784d594f761ddd3e301c652944d8"}, "3": {"node_id": "b6379325-400a-41e2-b618-9c14f68a4e4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "474b9947acb7eab7feaa310ad78466e470fc9d231195a7a6626ef5bcc4a7940b"}}, "hash": "bd51fd0ee868aeeb3567b1c6777e62d84e5d9f31126055a6637f520a5b41ae7d", "text": "Hopping along the city's concrete peaks, watched by surveillance cameras, a series of neon signs seems to be directing you somewhere specific. Follow the path and you meet an AI called B-12 who wants to join you in returning to the great outdoors. It uploads itself into a tiny drone and 3D-prints a harness around the cat in which to house itself. B-12 is now your partner, the mouth and hands you'll need to converse with robots, hack doors, and store puzzle-solving items\u2014crucial in a concrete and metal conurbation where nobody thought to install cat flaps.You'll rely on your buddy most once you reach a little oasis in amongst the mess where robots have made their home. This place thrums with life, even though there's none, with haphazard streets framed by neon signs that neatly reverse edgy cyberpunk connotations, bringing a healthy glow to an enclave robbed of sunlight. Stray now gives you space to play again, as B-12 helps you seek information from the androids and aid them in return. A barter bot will trade useful bric-a-brac for energy drinks, for example, while a guitarist wants you to seek out music sheets so she can play some songs.These androids aren't merely quest givers\u2014they're an essential supporting cast. It's fascinating to see how the human-built machines have picked up on fragments of their makers' dead culture. They don items of human clothing, displaying facial expressions on monitor heads crowned by hair made from nests of wires\u2014a fashion consciousness born of half-understood mimicry that nonetheless feels authentic because it wasn't socially programmed. At the same time, they have no frame of reference when it comes to meeting a cat, thus standing idly as you jump on their tables, knocking over their cups. In other words, they're like every minor RPG NPC you've ever met, except here they make sense.It's also when you start criss-crossing this populated settlement and its interiors\u2014jumping on a bar next to a collapsed drinker, or between bookshelves in a researcher's lab\u2014that the solidity of Stray's scenery comes to the fore. 3D game worlds are often an awkward combination of items that don't budge and others that fly or break at the slightest touch, but from the perspective of a cat that's how things work. Most things are too heavy to disrupt, except those empty bottles you can scatter, or the pile of books you jump on, then send teetering to collapse as you propel yourself off again. And despite occasional visual anomalies, such as clipping or brief animation glitches, Stray creates a believable logic to the way your fun-sized tiger navigates spaces.Because of that, indulging your sense of kitty mischief and inquisitiveness becomes especially enticing. Wheelie bins and air-con units offer quick vertical ascension, and once you're up on the roof, can you resist pawing a paint can off a ledge? Or at ground level, how about entering a home and pulling down the curtains, or scratching the rugs? That's always fun. Yet rather than gratuitous, causing minor chaos seems like a side effect of natural curiosity, traversing a world that isn't built for your instincts. You aren't clumsily smashing the place up, you're expressing yourself, strongly encouraged by the game design.For the rest of its duration, Stray continues to oscillate between playfulness and danger. As your determined cat gradually rises towards the surface again, you make new robot friends, helping them to reach their goals, get into tighter scrapes, and learn more about the history of this buried city in its richly detailed ruins. Throughout the 6-8-hour run time, the objectives remain clear and simple, leaving you plenty of space to enjoy the worldbuilding and simply being a cat.\u00a0To a degree, this simplicity is a weakness, in that it feels as if there's room for Stray to stretch its systems and your skills a bit more, adding urgency to sequences of jumps, perhaps, or extra complexity to its puzzles. Because it doesn't, a few sequences get stuck in low gear, such as when you get to fight back against the zurks, a confrontation that boils down to repeated backpedalling and shooting (and places the bland digital abilities of B-12 at centre stage, rather than our fluffy hero's), or don't evolve enough to escape the sense that they lack originality, serving up tasks that follow well-rehearsed genre lines.Still, Stray compensates for such lapses by ensuring each idea makes room for the next before it leaves a stain, acting as merely one part of an ensemble.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6379325-400a-41e2-b618-9c14f68a4e4b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6379325-400a-41e2-b618-9c14f68a4e4b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f88b5f88-9873-4c91-a9ad-698b0e3159f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd51fd0ee868aeeb3567b1c6777e62d84e5d9f31126055a6637f520a5b41ae7d"}, "3": {"node_id": "81f1eda8-b94e-43e6-aa5c-95e650a179e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd8f7489ce22f7ced07d8f825dd6b1533ebacd52085f4af2b8d6aad922473aa4"}}, "hash": "474b9947acb7eab7feaa310ad78466e470fc9d231195a7a6626ef5bcc4a7940b", "text": "But more than that, it remains a revelation precisely because it takes familiar adventure game tropes and makes them purr with smoother, cleaner mechanics. Rather than provide a roughly approximated simulation of people interacting with people, it builds fleeting but impactful relationships of mutual reliance between cat and robot. Stray's commitment to this premise, packed with the nuances of both feline and android life, is a triumph.Throughout, playing a cat never stops being a joy. Perhaps the biggest endorsement I can give Stray is that even some defenceless stealth sequences in its final third are not only tolerable, but actually entertaining\u2014surely a first. Like so much in the game, the character makes them work. What it lacks in complexity, then, it more than makes up for with agility and adaptability. If only more games had such sharp instincts.Simple, polished systems allow Stray's rich fiction and charismatic star to shine.Stray is being made into an animated film that Annapurna hopes will be 'the first and greatest hopepunk movie that's ever been made'Stray's raising money for real stray catsWordle today: Hint and answer #861 for Saturday, October 28By Katie Wickens18 October 2023By Jacob Ridley17 October 2023By Noah Smith16 October 2023By Ian Evenden13 October 2023By Tom Hatfield12 October 2023By Harvey Randall12 October 2023By Rick Lane10 October 2023By Jorge Jimenez9 October 2023By Jacob Ridley5 October 2023By Phil Iwaniuk4 October 2023By Dave James4 October 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Take this feeling and now imagine you\u2019re a fluffy little being who\u2019s not only lost, but surrounded by large, two-legged, metallic creatures, none of whom are impressed when you knock something off a table, and you have something close to the dilemma faced by the poor protagonist cat of Stray.On the surface, this is a game that tells a simple science-fiction of a cat who, after falling into the city\u2019s underbelly, Lion-King-style, must escape a mysterious place with the hope of reuniting with their family. But beneath that is something more.Still, when it comes to simply recreating the experience of being a cat, developer BlueTwelve Studio has done a wonderful job; playing as a cat feels  unique, while also being surprisingly easy to master. It's all the little features, though, that truly capture a cat\u2019s essence, from knocking items off ledges to the little pawprints you leave behind after walking through wet paint, or how the controls invert when you investigate a paper bag. None of these are purely cosmetic things, either, with each screensaver-like moment coming to serve a purpose in your journey. Meowing, for example, can attract enemies so you can trap them, while scratching at a blind can reveal a window to climb through. Even sleeping goes beyond the sheer cuteness of the moment by causing the camera to zoom out, so you get a wider view of your current location.Stray is constantly encouraging you to explore like this - to discover how high the cat can climb. Helpfully, the act of navigating the city itself is also an incredible amount of fun. Your ginger paws weave across rooftops and clamber up the sides of buildings one air vent at a time, while exploring through the feline perspective emphasises just how labyrinthine the city is, with the possibility of dead ends or danger around any corner. Nearly every object you encounter can be climbed or jumped on - why take the stairs, when you can run along the handrail after all? While ziplines (you hop into a little bucket, in case you were wondering how a cat might manage that) provide a quick descent from high places, giving you a good look at your surroundings as you fall. You\u2019ll quickly learn that there are multiple ways to reach certain locations, especially in the slums where you may find yourself abandoning the alleyways in favour of the roofs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81f1eda8-b94e-43e6-aa5c-95e650a179e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "81f1eda8-b94e-43e6-aa5c-95e650a179e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6379325-400a-41e2-b618-9c14f68a4e4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "474b9947acb7eab7feaa310ad78466e470fc9d231195a7a6626ef5bcc4a7940b"}, "3": {"node_id": "9db1647f-27ed-4df9-ac02-36bdc3033e3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f4298064fe6540bfa8a2f98a1141a20631f4c719f12c6432dd5268cc54de4c2"}}, "hash": "cd8f7489ce22f7ced07d8f825dd6b1533ebacd52085f4af2b8d6aad922473aa4", "text": "As your confidence grows, you\u2019ll spend less time planning your routes, instead jumping naturally, much like how a cockey alley cat would out on the real streets of your town.The only, very small, hitch to your roleplaying is how you can\u2019t customise or change the cat\u2019s breed, but this doesn\u2019t stop you from embodying the type of cat who lives within your soul. Are you a snuggle beast always on the lookout for robots to rub against or sleep on? Perhaps you\u2019re a dedicated climber? Or maybe you\u2019re a force of chaos - prepared to scratch every wall, knock down every book pile and meow constantly through every cutscene. Aside from immersing yourself in the cat mindset, another important side to Stray is its puzzling. Traversing the city will lead you to encountering a range of environmental puzzles which are solved by using the abandoned debris; a barrel can be positioned near an out-of-reach ledge, for example, by rolling the container from the inside. Delving deeper into the cybercity will lead to puzzles where you must work alongside B-12 - the drone you befriend - by completing certain acts, like leading enemies astray, while it hacks a machine. (Though it doesn\u2019t follow the hacker tradition of \u2018green text on a black screen,\u2019 so I\u2019m a little doubtful of its skills.)While the environmental puzzles are quite short, the longer puzzle sequences involve hunting down a robot or item, therefore transforming you into a cat detective. These sequences are some of my favourite parts of Stray, because it allows you to solve certain sections before they gain plot relevance, preventing you from feeling forced along by the game\u2019s narrative. I had a poncho in my inventory for a good hour before it was actually needed - admittedly I thought I was receiving a cat sized poncho, but alas. This freedom results in very rewarding moments when you realise a small, almost random, action you completed a while ago is now the key for progression. Weaving through all this, Stray tells its story through a series of chapters, some releasing you into an open area perfect for investigation, while others focus around navigating a section of the decaying city. While the latter follows a far more linear structure, they still provide engaging challenges, especially when it comes to avoiding Zurks - the fleshy, one-eyed, grub-like creatures who will happily eat the cat if given the chance. Stray does allow you to revisit any past chapter without consequence, granting you an element of control over its linearity so you can find a missing collectible or engage in even more cat antics. There are a few diversions from Stray\u2019s main quest, with the best, and longest, tasking you to restore B-12\u2019s corrupted memories. It\u2019s reminiscent of the memory locations from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, except instead of beautiful vistas, you\u2019re given glitchy pictures of a wall, plant or hidden nook which you have to find within the city. It\u2019s another way in which Stray encourages exploration - while some are encountered by simply following the plot, the majority of the memories hide off the beaten tracks. Like any good cat would, you must slip through broken fences and lurk in alleyways to find them all. Doing so will help you piece together more of the city\u2019s history and what led to its current state. Yet, the further you roam, the more Stray reveals it is also the tale of B-12, the robots and the city itself. B-12 undertakes a journey of self-discovery, growing beyond a useful companion who carries your inventory and illuminates dark corners, by travelling alongside you. Through the robots you witness their attempts to carve out an existence, but learn their efforts are being stifled due to the actions and society structure created by the long dead. During your travels, you\u2019ll meet a group of robots called the Outsiders longing to escape the city and assist another in finding his missing father. (We\u2019re not going to tackle robot reproduction here - let\u2019s move on.) Part of the city\u2019s history is told through environmental storytelling - posters, graffiti and a recurring date all hint at what happened long ago. These different threads combine into one larger narrative about the lengths people will take to survive and how this desire can become polluted. Which thread captures you the most will differ depending on your taste - for me, it was the city.Stray\u2019s city is a claustrophobic construction of houses squeezed tightly together, minuscule safe open spaces and neon lights offering harsh comfort in the endless night.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9db1647f-27ed-4df9-ac02-36bdc3033e3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9db1647f-27ed-4df9-ac02-36bdc3033e3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "81f1eda8-b94e-43e6-aa5c-95e650a179e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd8f7489ce22f7ced07d8f825dd6b1533ebacd52085f4af2b8d6aad922473aa4"}, "3": {"node_id": "3109f1c6-5c74-4c9c-8562-cc6ea1d0e623", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "444a500c13cd134083dfe838a0351cdbb2043522a20b10e5a7fcae2ee3cdc551"}}, "hash": "9f4298064fe6540bfa8a2f98a1141a20631f4c719f12c6432dd5268cc54de4c2", "text": "The only glimpse of the outside world within its walls are repeated pictures of a tropical beach and, oddly, the occasional cow picture, which start to feel mocking as you wonder how long it\u2019s been since daylight touched the city. There are times when you truly comprehend its scale - ziplining across the skyline or simply standing above the areas you\u2019ve previously explored - and, within these moments, the city feels immense, but then you notice how the orange glow of the Zurk\u2019s flesh structures are steadily encroaching on the small spots of robot sanctuary. On your expedition through the sewers you learn, through a delicious piece of body horror, this is a fight the robots will lose. Gradually, the city reveals itself to be a prison - one where the robots are trapped at the bottom of a pit, subject to the failings of those who came before, as spotlights shine like false stars from the roof above. It's by doing this - looking at the world through feline eyes - that Stray creates a journey filled with such a sense of exploration, on top of the chance to indulge in as much cat-truction as you like. While doing so, though, it also crafts a touching story about the human desires of those who, at a glance, lack humanity - be it to reunite with a loved one, protect a community or reach the outside world. The result is a wonderful mix: a game about the longing for freedom, clever climbing mechanics, and every cat\u2019s eternal desire to knock items off shelves.\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nLottie Lynn\n\n          Guides Editor\n        Lottie Lynn is Eurogamer's Guides Editor.

There are a lot of kitties on that credit list, so it all makes sense. From the little chirp meows our nameless feline hero emits as they make a larger leap, to just the way they move around between objects and run along railings, everything has been thought about and brought to life with meticulous detail.\u00a0Release date: July 19, 2022\nPlatform(s): PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One\nDeveloper: BlueTwelve Studio\nPublisher: Annapurna InteractiveThe fact you are a cat in a world full of robots imbues everything you do with a sense of wonder. You're tiny after all, a lost stray who finds itself trapped in a locked-down city long left behind by human life. It's a place built on decades of trash, with the robots living fairly sad lives in makeshift homes. And yet, somehow it's also rather beautiful. Stray's world is a stunning place to just exist in, which feels odd to say for a trash city. Ray tracing lets you see neon lights reflected in gathered groundwater, and you can almost feel the slight smog that hangs in the air around you \u2013 Stray is able to generate atmosphere quite unlike anything else I've played this year. \u00a0\u00a0Updated on August 10 to reflect that Stray is now available on Xbox Series X and Xbox One.But, despite this being the land of robots, developer BlueTwelve Studio has made sure that every part of it feels accessible, and has designed so many elements to make being a cat within this world super rewarding. Whether you're running across piano keys, interfering with a mahjong game, typing a cluster of letters into a computer, knocking paint pots off ledges to splat onto the pavement below, walking through said paint to leave little pawprints along the street, playing with the balls on a pool table, finding various sleep spots to take a nap, or clawing at everything you possibly can. You are, after all, a playful young cat and all of that is just what cats do, something which BlueTwelve Studio captures with ease.\u00a0That playful nature also extends to the way you're able to connect with the cat under your command. You can meow on cue with a press of the Circle button, which makes the cry emit from the DualSense controller \u2013 which is later joined by the purrs of your sleeping kitty when you take a break. It's a simple but effective way to make you really feel connected to the orange tabby, and it's truly delightful.\u00a0The way the city is built really takes advantage of the way a cat can move, opening up the full vertical scale of the playable space.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae44879e-baef-47c1-8c67-9fbb1c242cb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae44879e-baef-47c1-8c67-9fbb1c242cb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "3109f1c6-5c74-4c9c-8562-cc6ea1d0e623", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "444a500c13cd134083dfe838a0351cdbb2043522a20b10e5a7fcae2ee3cdc551"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c56880d-2343-42a9-ab1e-42a73fcc3a2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0721a09a66b16a585eb983a2a9a4bdca15854d7f0e596e1513e5b714bcd25c8"}}, "hash": "76a2c227067ae1fbe0790753eccb3ffa563072f3f027bb9ee45996741926825c", "text": "You'll start seeing clear paths for smaller paws opening up the more you figure out how our hero moves and what he can do, squeezing through grates, under cars, and of course leaping from ledge to ledge. I'll admit, I was a touch nervous going into Stray that jumping was accomplished by button prompts, but in reality, it all feels incredibly natural.\u00a0The more comfortable you become with the controls over time, the more the city starts to resemble a playground. As the cat, you're always looking for your next spot to jump to. You look, you aim, you press X to leap. Holding down X and moving the camera lets you chain together jumps too, and suddenly you feel as agile as a real-life cat. Although sometimes the camera can feel awkward if you're trying to scale a particularly narrow space when looking for the next spot. But, it's a small grumble, because the majority of the time you always feel nimble and agile, and exploring is always something you're going to want to do more of.\u00a0Of course, in Stray, our feline hero can also do much more. It's not long into the story \u2013 which lasts for anywhere between 6-10 hours, depending on how much you poke your inquisitive nose into every corner \u2013 that you're joined by B-12, the tiny drone who serves as your main connection to the world. Through B-12 you can communicate with the robot civilization, spark up conversations, and search for a way back to the outside world you left behind. It's through these simple \u00a0interactions that you'll drive the narrative onwards, which is a touching tale of friendship and hardship in equal measure. (If you're anything like me and incredibly protective of the fuzzy hero, then be prepared to feel a touch emotional at points too.)While Stray's atmosphere does a great job of organically conveying the history of the city, interacting with it will peel back more of its rusted layers. Talking to the robots will give you insight into their lives, how the humans ceased to exist, and how oppressive the living conditions can be. Discovering a TV in a back alley lets you flick through channels to really immerse yourself in their weird world and culture too. I also love the smaller, totally optional, errands that bring you closer to some of the inhabitants, like collecting music sheets for a musician to play from, and then settling down next to them while they strum away on a petrol-can guitar.The mechanics involved might be limited \u2013 you are a cat after all \u2013 but being able to carry items in your mouth, scan objects and info with B-12, and jump around with ease is used in so many different ways that Stray never gets boring. There are puzzles to solve, sections of stealth, and plenty of exploring to be done, which all combine beautifully. Figuring out that clawing at a door might get someone to answer it is a lovely touch too. It helps that Stray never outstays its welcome in terms of length, of course, but I dare say I could never get bored of rubbing up against a robot's leg and watching their display change to a love heart.\u00a0What I'll never be happy with is watching our hero die. They say that curiosity killed the cat, and sadly, sometimes it does. The world isn't just lived in by robots, there are also tick-like creatures that look so much like headcrabs I feel like Valve might be having a word. Outside of the urban areas of the city, you'll have to try and outrun packs of the creatures, as they burst from gross bulb-shaped sacks and try to suck your blood. If they do get on you, you're able to shake them free, but it's easy to be overwhelmed and perish. Thankfully, this digital feline has far more than nine lives, so it's not too much of a drama to respawn, but my goodness it's not easy to watch. These more perilous sections add a brilliant balance to the calmer, more exploratory moments that make the majority of the game too.\u00a0In fact, bar some camera issues, my only frustration with Stray is something only completionists will appreciate \u2013 a lack of signposting. There are times where moving through to a new area completely locks off where you've been previously, meaning any side quests left unfinished will have to remain so until after the end credits when you can jump into previous chapters. \u00a0Regardless of whether you're a cat lover, or just fancy a brilliant little platformer to sink into, then Stray is an excellent romp. Yes, it does help if you're a cat lover because it is so beautifully animated and captures the cat's personality so perfectly, but there's so much to love here.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c56880d-2343-42a9-ab1e-42a73fcc3a2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c56880d-2343-42a9-ab1e-42a73fcc3a2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae44879e-baef-47c1-8c67-9fbb1c242cb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "76a2c227067ae1fbe0790753eccb3ffa563072f3f027bb9ee45996741926825c"}, "3": {"node_id": "1744a55e-cd05-4e63-b926-1f0f5ef1cf62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b7af13febd2e9f91c9417059aaedb449e6800b609d21f3b04f9d978d503a18c"}}, "hash": "e0721a09a66b16a585eb983a2a9a4bdca15854d7f0e596e1513e5b714bcd25c8", "text": "Between the alluring semi-post-apocalyptic story, the dense, atmospheric world, and the cast of quirky characters that inhabit it, BlueTwelve Studio has created a fantastic experience here.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, The most realistic cat ever to appear in a video game is the star of a peculiar cyberpunk style adventure in a world ruled by robots.No matter how popular they may be on YouTube, cats are always the last choice for an animal hero, whether it\u2019s movies, TV, or video games. Bubsy Bobcat, Mae from Night In The Woods, and Meowth are already scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of cat-themed protagonists and the reason for that seems obvious: as cute as they are, a cat wouldn\u2019t lift a paw to help anyone. But there\u2019s always an exception to the rule.Stray is an unusual game in a number of ways. For starters, it\u2019s an indie title that often looks better than many a full price game. Although it\u2019s actually completely free if you\u2019re a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscriber, as this is the first example of a new game being available from day one on the service. (There\u2019s also a free trial for PS Plus Premium this week, so theoretically everyone can play the game for nothing.)You play as a cat, an ordinary non-anthropomorphised cat, but in a post-apocalyptic, Blade Runner style city populated by robots and what look like the headcrabs from Half-Life. The game flits between whimsical fetch quests, such as making someone a poncho to keep them warm, to survival horror style elements accompanied by a discordant industrial soundtrack. Like we said, it\u2019s an unusual game, but rarely a dull one.Although nothing is explained in any detail, the implication is that hundreds of years ago the Earth suffered some kind of ecological breakdown, exacerbated by the creation of a special bacteria to break down waste that, by the time of the game, has evolved into the headcrab-like Zurks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1744a55e-cd05-4e63-b926-1f0f5ef1cf62": {"__data__": {"id_": "1744a55e-cd05-4e63-b926-1f0f5ef1cf62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c56880d-2343-42a9-ab1e-42a73fcc3a2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0721a09a66b16a585eb983a2a9a4bdca15854d7f0e596e1513e5b714bcd25c8"}, "3": {"node_id": "fae0b33e-c296-4543-a88c-c987d20e5d8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe0a353148621a6b5707d3d713ef9f62a117706749da9ee545cedd7c4444641a"}}, "hash": "0b7af13febd2e9f91c9417059aaedb449e6800b609d21f3b04f9d978d503a18c", "text": "At first, the cat (he doesn\u2019t have a name so we\u2019re going to call him George) knows nothing of this because he and his pals live in an area where nature has grown back, but after taking a fall George finds himself in a subterranean walled city, purposefully locked off from the rest of the world.The idea seems to have been to lock everyone inside until nature has had a chance to repair itself, but humans have long since died out and the only inhabitants of the city are robots, who also live in fear of the Zurks and have begun to believe that the outside world is just a myth. For a game about a cute furball, Stray has a peculiarly melancholy atmosphere, with the virtual immortality of the robots having forced most of them into a state of lethargic ennui.A few have rebelled though and it\u2019s these that George befriends, as he journeys through the sewer system, the dystopian Midtown, and onwards towards the city\u2019s administrative centre. There are two or three open world hub areas in the game, where you\u2019re in no danger, while the other sections are more linear but still with a few hidden secrets.Stray is essentially a puzzle platformer. There\u2019s no jump button as such but as long as you\u2019re close enough to a platform George will automatically leap there. There\u2019s some inconsistencies in terms of what surfaces are reachable but generally this works very well at maintaining the illusion you\u2019re controlling a real cat, and not a cartoon character that vaguely looks like one.We do hate to use the term, for obvious reasons, but Stray has one of the most extreme cases of ludonarrative dissonance we\u2019ve seen in a long time. That is to say, there\u2019s a major disconnect between the story and what you actually do in the gameplay. Despite George being an ordinary cat he not only seems to understand everything said to him but he happily carries around things like buckets and power supplies in his mouth, to solve physics based puzzles like an ordinary video game character.Obviously, he\u2019s doing that because you\u2019re controlling him, but in the context of the story itself it makes no sense. Indeed, the fact that he\u2019s a cat has no real bearing on anything, other than the fact that he\u2019s good at jumping. It doesn\u2019t have to, in order to be a good game, but something along the lines of Untitled Goose Game seems a much better template for a cat simulator than Super Cyberpunk Bros.As it is, early on in the game you meet a little drone who attaches a backpack to George and helps by translating the robots and acting as a gun to deal with the Zurks (they don\u2019t like ultraviolet light). The Zurks only seem to lurk in the sewers though and once you\u2019re through to Midtown they\u2019re completely forgotten about and instead the threat becomes overzealous security robots.Midtown looks absolutely amazing, like the best Blade Runner adaptation never made, but there\u2019s less to do in it than the opening hub area and the whole surveillance society angle is severely undercooked, with no indication of who\u2019s in charge or what they actually believe.It does provide the opportunity for some perfectly enjoyable stealth elements, which involve such stalwarts as staying outside of an enemy\u2019s zone of vision and hiding in boxes. Although the tone is odd, especially the creepier stuff with the Zurks, the game seems to be aimed primarily at casual gamers and as such it\u2019s a good primer for many common elements, including platforming, shooting, stealth, and fetch quests.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationEven with the, often literal, signposting It\u2019s not patronisingly easy but you\u2019ll speed through it in six hours or so and while you\u2019ll probably miss some collectables there\u2019s not really much incentive to play any of it again. At normal price we\u2019d struggle to recommend the game but since it is free with PS Plus Extra, and that\u2019s how most people are going to play it, this is an agreeably undemanding adventure.Whether it will inspire others to give cats more starring roles we\u2019ll have to wait and see but if nothing else this is the most realistic portrayal of the feline form ever seen in a video game. Saying it\u2019s not something you\u2019d necessarily want to pay for sounds like a damning indictment, but it shouldn\u2019t be taken that way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fae0b33e-c296-4543-a88c-c987d20e5d8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fae0b33e-c296-4543-a88c-c987d20e5d8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "1744a55e-cd05-4e63-b926-1f0f5ef1cf62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b7af13febd2e9f91c9417059aaedb449e6800b609d21f3b04f9d978d503a18c"}, "3": {"node_id": "845aebae-779c-4632-b34d-fe55c8bfba44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3410c6e34045f1a3b3b428fe8a7d3c36eebc4d841a2c36cf04cf41b22ce862d0"}}, "hash": "fe0a353148621a6b5707d3d713ef9f62a117706749da9ee545cedd7c4444641a", "text": "This is a perfect introduction to traditional video games, for those that don\u2019t usually play them, and a fun diversion, that doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome, for those that do.In Short: A peculiar mix of cyberpunk dystopia and whimsical platformer that is just about held together by some excellent visuals and a very cute cat.Pros: The platforming, puzzle-solving, stealth, and gunplay all work well and are very accessible for casual gamers.

You see, explore, and mess with the world in the ways only they can. Because you're doing so in one of the more densely-packed video game worlds in recent memory, there's plenty of room for kitty antics. Luckily, Stray wastes no moment letting you fulfill any feline aspirations you may have.\u00a0After being separated from their furry friends, the unnamed cat (we'll call \"Stray\") finds itself deep in an underground city walled off from the outside by a giant dome. Befriending a small drone named B12, Stray sets out to open the city, the wish of many of its android citizens, who have heard rumors but never once seen the sun, clouds, and the like.\u00a0Stray makes excellent use of the fact you play as a cat. Because you're such a small, agile creature, you must rethink platforming. A tiny inaccessible ledge in another video game becomes a critical path. A gate might stand in front of your objective, but because you're so tiny, you just slip through its grates. The animation throughout is fantastic, feeling believable to the minute movements cats make \u2013 so much so that my dog growled at my computer when I first started playing. Stray constantly finds new opportunities to play with its character \u2013 in both significant and minor ways, like pushing things off tables and scratching at doors \u2013 and I had a lot of fun discovering these unique interactions while exploring the world.\u00a0Inspired by Hong Kong's now-demolished real-life Kowloon Walled City \u2013 notable for its strikingly dense architecture and population \u2013 Stray's world is artistically fantastic. The underground city is constantly impressive and a joy to explore, from underground sewers to cluttered cityscapes full of neon, from highly-detailed apartments to lonely rooftops. Because it's so densely packed, levels often feel like mazes, and I loved learning my way around their labyrinthian streets.You spend Stray's four-hour runtime exploring the various districts, meeting citizens, and performing tasks. Stray is apparently the most brilliant cat to ever live, able to solve logic puzzles, understand language, and run hyper-specific errands, and I loved this loop. I was excited every time I entered a new district, knowing a new set of puzzles and conversations awaited me. I enjoyed the occasional dips into combat, stealth, and evasion far less as they never did much interesting with the cat. You more or less just run or hide in a corner or shine a light at enemies until they blow up and call it a day. Luckily these were few and far between, but any time they did pop up, it was monotonous.\u00a0\u00a0While its story is simple, never going beyond surface explorations of the relationships between humans and cities, it's affecting. As I met more citizens, each wrestling with what it means to be alive despite being robots (think Nier: Automata, which the game references), I became invested in the overall world. I also enjoyed the funny and touching relationship between B12 and Stray, who form a solid partnership where the drone helps the cat navigate and understand the world around it.\u00a0Stray is, more than anything, a charming game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "845aebae-779c-4632-b34d-fe55c8bfba44": {"__data__": {"id_": "845aebae-779c-4632-b34d-fe55c8bfba44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "fae0b33e-c296-4543-a88c-c987d20e5d8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fe0a353148621a6b5707d3d713ef9f62a117706749da9ee545cedd7c4444641a"}, "3": {"node_id": "8eed07d3-6728-4e9e-a2b5-2a1c10fe9663", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2399a0ac1d8e9b15915fd33952254ac1f0dbbc6ccecdb86cda270f0e0a11420e"}}, "hash": "3410c6e34045f1a3b3b428fe8a7d3c36eebc4d841a2c36cf04cf41b22ce862d0", "text": "Stray is, more than anything, a charming game.

My soft, limp body was overwhelmed by a swarm of vicious creatures that scurry around in herds. The screen flashed red and encouraged me to \u201cretry,\u201d but the message was clear: You Died. The first time this happened, I clung to the belief that my tiny kitty protagonist was just unconscious. Surely, I thought, this adorable game wouldn\u2019t actually let me die. Eventually, my delusion was shattered: I learned that these creatures, Zurks, evolved from experimental bacteria and eat anything and everything, including metal. I glanced at my real-life orange boy, Oni, who\u2019d been yelling at me through this whole sequence of events, drawn to the sound effects and frenzied Zurks.

It\u2019s not quite the same premise, but the same strain of emotional anguish watching sweet animals brave treacherous circumstances. (Thank you for your service as Sassy, Sally Field.) I\u2019m reluctantly conscious of the fact that the constant presence of Oni, a tender little coward who wouldn\u2019t last five minutes outside, informs my perception of Stray\u2019s protagonist; I suspect that many cat owners \u2014 bless toxoplasmosis \u2014 will form a similar connection. Most people don\u2019t like to see animals get hurt, so there\u2019s an instant sense of emotional and psychological investment, compounded by a default instinct to protect the baby. The game opens with a family of cats living in lush, green, sunlit ruins. I\u2019m just a tiny orange guy, and life is good \u2014 full of playing, sleeping, and exploring. It\u2019s a short tutorial area where I play around with the cats\u2019 lifelike movements and vocalizations. Stray is mostly a straightforward platforming game with some puzzles sprinkled in; in lieu of combat, there\u2019s a focus on the catlike ability to sneak, evade, and escape. My peaceful existence shatters when I miss a routine jump off a pipe and find myself plummeting to my doom. My loved ones watch helplessly as I vanish into darkness. I land in a heap, crumpled but unbroken, in the garbage-strewn bowels of a forgotten city. There is no grass, and there is no light. I\u2019m alone, and it\u2019s devastating. Stray\u2019s premise is simple: Get home or die trying. (Sometimes literally; at other times, I get tased.) In the Dead City, I befriend a flying drone called B12, who gives me a cat-sized backpack to help recharge its battery and store key items (thanks to unspecified technology, B12 can dematerialize objects like bottles and notes and remake them on demand). It can also help me hack into simple door panels and communicate with others. We meet a community of robots \u2014 \u201cCompanions\u201d who once served now-extinct humans and continue to go through the motions of humanlike life. Among them are Outsiders, a small minority that believes in the myth of a blue sky. Soon, my small personal goal to escape folds into a bigger narrative about survival in a police state, under a conspiratorial veil about whether \u201cOutside\u201d even exists.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8eed07d3-6728-4e9e-a2b5-2a1c10fe9663": {"__data__": {"id_": "8eed07d3-6728-4e9e-a2b5-2a1c10fe9663", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "845aebae-779c-4632-b34d-fe55c8bfba44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3410c6e34045f1a3b3b428fe8a7d3c36eebc4d841a2c36cf04cf41b22ce862d0"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e12272c-615a-464f-b600-33f299e21bda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac86ba7429d46cd4363b66cc14fb90f9b1d3e409a5befa93b656127af10bc404"}}, "hash": "2399a0ac1d8e9b15915fd33952254ac1f0dbbc6ccecdb86cda270f0e0a11420e", "text": "Besides the Zurks, there are cops, perilous sections of cat parkour, ominous organic growths all over the city, and a strange new horror in the sewers. Movement is pretty familiar if you\u2019ve ever watched a cat: acrobatic leaps from perch to perch, the butt-waggling low crawl, and a couple of occasions for a back-arching yowl and hiss. There are a few cozy spots to sleep, including a nice warm robot belly, and I deeply enjoy rubbing up against strangers\u2019 legs and watching their little face-screens blip out a heart in response. I can push objects off of shelves, scratch on doors to be let in, carry items in my mouth, and trip over unsuspecting robots. The inherent catness of my behavior is a constant delight, and feeds back into my unwavering devotion to my little guy\u2019s safety, like an unmoored eye of Sauron watching for danger around every corner. There are several running gauntlets where I have to flee waves of Zurks, which is upsetting for me as a human, but prime movie time for Oni, who is unrepentantly vocal about his small pixelated doppelganger and the chittering creatures surrounding it. I\u2019m playing on PC with a Nintendo Switch Pro controller, which robs me of the PlayStation rumble function for purrs and meows, but on the other hand, probably saves me from having to constantly dislodge Oni from my hands.In Stray, much like real cat thinking, there\u2019s nowhere to go but up. The city is structured as a vertical dystopia \u2014 a widespread sci-fi concept in pop culture from J.G. Ballard to Gurren Lagann. The lowest tiers are poor and disenfranchised, while those living higher up exist in a bougie haze of consumerism. Whoever\u2019s in control lives at the top. Later, I find a Metro map that delineates the Lower Town, Upper Town (\u201cMidtown\u201d), and the uppermost Exit. The cyberpunk influences are obvious, with neon signs, narrow alleys, and incredibly dense, haphazard architecture \u00e0 la the Kowloon Walled City. From the tong lau-style tenements to the ubiquitous flyposting with local eight-digit phone numbers, there\u2019s an undeniable sense of Hong Kongness here, which isn\u2019t surprising, given that Stray\u2019s working title was \u201cHK project.\u201d (BlueTwelve\u2019s website still uses the domain hk-devblog.com).I coast through Stray believing in both this Hong Kong identity and authorship, reading into every bit of flavor text about small, everyday forms of resistance against state oppression, and the importance of art in \u201cdesperate situations.\u201d These aren\u2019t unique to Hong Kong \u2014 resistance art in particular has been a core part of political expression for centuries. The city\u2019s struggle to maintain autonomy within the limits of its special administrative region status under the Chinese government has inspired people all over the world with its \u201cbe water\u201d protest tactics to repel police tear gas and move as one. For several years, Hong Kong police brutality was a common motif in international news, until finally, student protesters and resistance figureheads were publicly persecuted, vilified, and imprisoned. Upon reaching Midtown in Stray, all of these threads come together when I see civilian robots being hassled by \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d cops. My knee-jerk expectation is some kind of dramatic showdown with the pigs, but Stray isn\u2019t that sort of game \u2014 it\u2019s about staying small, unseen, and alive.Until the credits rolled, I assumed Stray was made by a Hong Kong developer. (I prefer to know as little as possible about a game before I play it.) So I was surprised to learn that BlueTwelve Studio is French, run by an enigmatic duo from Montpellier. Apparently, this early Hong Kong-centric branding created a common enough misconception that the studio made an FAQ-style post to explain its origins and inspiration. The developers said that they wanted their own unique flavor of dystopia, but that\u2019s hard to fully do when Western cyberpunk relies on such a fixed set of uniquely East Asian visuals. This isn\u2019t to say that Stray fails at creating an evocative, familiar world \u2014 BlueTwelve\u2019s tribute to Hong Kong is well executed and full of detail. But it does make me wonder when the games industry will bestow the same kind of Annapurna-level attention on projects made by actual Hongkongers that invoke the Hong Kong identity in deeper, more personal ways (like the currently-in-development Name of the Will).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e12272c-615a-464f-b600-33f299e21bda": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e12272c-615a-464f-b600-33f299e21bda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "8eed07d3-6728-4e9e-a2b5-2a1c10fe9663", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2399a0ac1d8e9b15915fd33952254ac1f0dbbc6ccecdb86cda270f0e0a11420e"}, "3": {"node_id": "51098e33-233d-433c-872f-6e9ed713de17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "86229b362cb8f12c809bfd26d756f3ad2086835aa11b0eb550bd6e1a996e0812"}}, "hash": "ac86ba7429d46cd4363b66cc14fb90f9b1d3e409a5befa93b656127af10bc404", "text": "Thankfully, Stray\u2019s uniqueness doesn\u2019t hinge on its cyberpunk setting. I\u2019ve written at length about this before, but cyberpunk has largely been exhausted as a vehicle for critique, and in many cases, it\u2019s used mostly to convey an instantly recognizable idea of modern dystopia. Frankly, BlueTwelve could have set this in a Victorian steampunk slum and it still would\u2019ve had the same effect: constant care and concern for our little orange friend. The game\u2019s most expressive settings are hidden behind the city\u2019s drab gray walls \u2014 charming, rundown residential interiors with CRT monitors, portable radios, and shades of 1970s oranges and greens. This lends a much-needed sense of temporal depth to the game\u2019s unspecified future setting. My favorite scene is a Nam June Paik-style jumble of old TVs tuned to a twinkling starlit sky \u2014 a chaotic altar to technology with a curious sense of spirituality. Finally, we come to mortality and endings \u2014 a wretched inevitability that all pet owners dread. There\u2019s a bittersweet inversion of this notion at the end, with an inevitable goodbye (no, it\u2019s not what you think) that compels me to try and hug Oni, who squirms away from my grotesque display of maudlin human emotion. Stray ends on a vague but hopeful note, which felt immediately unacceptable to me, a petty person who hates ambiguity when it comes to cute animals. It takes me a second to step back, after the credits, to gather my thoughts and mentally vacate the role of \u201ccat protector.\u201d I realize I have drunk deep from the well of kitty Kool-Aid, and I\u2019d do it again. Stray doesn\u2019t do anything new. But through strategic manipulation of our love for cats, it does give me a profoundly sentimental window into my relationship with Oni \u2014 my first cat, with whom I am admittedly obsessed. I started projecting him onto the protagonist from the get-go, and his constant presence as I played made for a strange meta experience of Stray\u2019s emotional design. It\u2019s a markedly different journey from cultivating care for a character in a typical role-playing game, whose quirks and lovable characteristics must be learned over time, through dialogue and gameplay and storytelling. Every small detail in Stray was a reminder of my finite time with both my on- and off-screen companions; once the game was over, I reached out to Oni, full of gooey feelings, and as expected, he yelled at me and ran off. BlueTwelve knew exactly what it was doing, spending so much time and care modeling real cat movements and behavior, but having a real cat at hand was a fitting jolt back to reality. Stray is truly (and perhaps fittingly) the work of sly cat people. And for this reason alone, it\u2019s a triumph. Stray will be released on July 19 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC.

Stray, an adventure-puzzle game where you play as a cat, manages not only to delight in its presentation but also in the many ways it eschews common puzzle mechanics to focus on the abilities and limitations of its protagonist. It's a consistently satisfying adventure with a charming story about companionship that rarely misses a beat across its well-paced runtime.You play as a stray cat that is quickly thrust into an entirely world underneath your own after a mishap that occurs in the opening minutes of the story.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51098e33-233d-433c-872f-6e9ed713de17": {"__data__": {"id_": "51098e33-233d-433c-872f-6e9ed713de17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e12272c-615a-464f-b600-33f299e21bda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ac86ba7429d46cd4363b66cc14fb90f9b1d3e409a5befa93b656127af10bc404"}, "3": {"node_id": "7cd6ffc3-80d0-4ec5-bde5-2f9965dc450b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6231089c0edb9fa9b7c440eed205eeb73a24437596e4a2022572df7366779d9"}}, "hash": "86229b362cb8f12c809bfd26d756f3ad2086835aa11b0eb550bd6e1a996e0812", "text": "Alone in this neon-soaked city that's beneath a giant, unmoving dome, you quickly befriend a small drone that becomes a trusted companion throughout your adventure, and a vital translator for all the other sentient robots that inhabit the handful of regions you'll visit. This drone, called B-12, also gives you more options to interact with the world around you, such as being able to hack doors to open them, kill dangerous flesh-eating aliens with a beam of purple light, or illuminate dark and dreary avenues as you explore them.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Stray Video ReviewOutside of the assistance from B-12, however, Stray fully embodies the abilities that being a cat would afford you in this situation. You've got a lot of mobility to get around, with contextual button presses on reachable surfaces letting you effortlessly jump up, down, and around pretty much anywhere you'd like. This approach allows each leap to look incredibly good, too, with detailed animation work making your movements look as natural and ballet-like as most cats do when navigating their environment.You can chain together these actions which makes platforming feel fast and fluid, providing a nice rush of momentum as you hold down the jump button and rotate the camera around to guide yourself along a string of leaps. There are rare instances where you can accidentally jump away from where you initially intended, and others where coming down from a high perch can be a bit more troublesome than getting up because of how you need to rotate the camera to see a platform to jump to. These moments, however, are fleeting enough that it hardly breaks up the thrill of being able to so easily get around.Throughout Stray you'll alternate between small hub areas that you're free to explore and more linear, focused portions, and both highlight your abilities in different ways. The verticality of the hubs help you understand the limits of how high and how far you can jump, while also offering neat secrets to find as you start exploring small routes that only a cat would likely be able to navigate. Linear portions are usually focused on speed, requiring you to start chaining together jumps while also challenging your understanding of what is and what isn't feasible given your small size. The ebb and flow between these two types of play gives Stray a delicately balanced pacing that allows it to introduce new tools for B-12 or new enemies to circumvent while never letting either overstay their welcome, as well as letting you enjoy the freedom of moving around its world at your leisure when things simmer down.Your mobility is key to solving Stray's many puzzles. Most of them rely on identifying a path to an objective, either through a series of jumps or constructing a path with the jumps by moving various elements around the world to create one. In other instances, you need to find objects to wedge into the blades of fans so you can pass through or use your claws to pull down parts of the environment to expose a new pathway to platform up. Most of Stray's puzzles are contained within small areas, which makes finding the solution relatively straightforward. They're never too challenging, but also not trivial, so solving them is consistently satisfying. In later stages, more complex scenarios involve some light stealth and dexterous movements around a space, which come at the right time as by then you'll have a firm grasp of how you're allowed to move about Stray's world.There are a handful of set pieces that aren't as enjoyable, however. These mostly occur in the first half of Stray's adventure, and usually involve having to circumvent groups of enemies that quickly jump and latch onto you in numbers to bring you down. It's not so much that the puzzles involved with these creatures are poorly designed, but rather that they often require you to run around awkwardly avoiding these enemies, rather than giving you strategic ways to deal with them. This is compounded by the fact that these enemies sometimes can jump far higher than you were previously led to believe, making the safety of vertical perches feel inconsistent. There's only a handful of these sections, but there's no doubt that they're the weakest in the journey.Stray's distinct hubs are usually introduced after these disappointing sections, with each one packed with rich detail despite their relatively small sizes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cd6ffc3-80d0-4ec5-bde5-2f9965dc450b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cd6ffc3-80d0-4ec5-bde5-2f9965dc450b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "51098e33-233d-433c-872f-6e9ed713de17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "86229b362cb8f12c809bfd26d756f3ad2086835aa11b0eb550bd6e1a996e0812"}, "3": {"node_id": "af883c87-f45d-4c1b-a1c3-4bb7ac24844e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a58b237ff3d32c9d917236d5dd23b871f08212b7e79a85acfaf898eb2d19eaa7"}}, "hash": "b6231089c0edb9fa9b7c440eed205eeb73a24437596e4a2022572df7366779d9", "text": "There are numerous robotic inhabitants to chat to (if only by proxy through your drone companion) and smaller side stories to uncover, many of which fill in the gaps of the core narrative concerning a world that has not seen humans for thousands of years. Touching moments between several characters do a great job of supplementing the core theme of companionship through the lens of these sentient AI discovering familial traits all on their own, while also dissecting the lack of empathy their makers must have had to let things get to the state in which you find them. It's delicately told and culminates in a satisfying conclusion that doesn't leave any questions lingering, but instead lets you reflect on the relationships you made along the way with warm fondness.The hubs themselves are also visually striking, with a high level of detail packed into their construction. The neon signage that punches through the darkness illuminates every crevice with bright, colorful lighting, accentuated by eye-catching reflections bounced by puddles on the streets. Shops and stalls all have distinct designs that you can pick apart by navigating around them, whether it's simply from the low angle of the diminutive feline protagonist, or atop shelves where there are many obstacles to push out of your way onto the floor. Outside of the city districts, cold and damp sewers are appropriately unwelcoming and off-putting, with some surprising elements that sometimes make Stray feel like it's bordering on becoming a horror game. Each new area you are introduced to is immediately captivating to wander around in, and I enjoyed spending a long time picking them apart.Stray's ultimate strength is how well its overall design embodies the unique perspective and capabilities of its protagonist, but it also doesn't rely on this to be the only distinguishing feature of the entire adventure. A lot of the enjoyment throughout Stray's runtime comes from how well each scenario is designed for the abilities of its feline hero, and how empowering it is to be able to navigate its gorgeous hubs and derelict cities with the additional agility on offer. Its puzzles are routinely satisfying to solve and all work in service of a charming story with a satisfying conclusion, with the pacing only knocked slightly off by some slightly less than stellar combat scenarios in the first half. Thankfully, they're not prevalent enough to detract from the otherwise captivating adventure that Stray is, and that it tells a tale that will likely linger with you after the game's credits have rolled.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nKotaku, \u201c\\\\csyu?zqdsctotpaplt\\\\kk\u201d\u201c\\\\kk.erjlmmmmmmmmmmm\u201dThose are some lines of dialogue from the purrtagonist (sorry) in Stray, a puzzle-platformer you may have colloquially referred to these past few years as The Cat Game. See, Stray isn\u2019t just a game about a cat. It\u2019s a game that casts you as a cat\u2014and, as such, very convincingly replicates feline behavior.Case in point: You, as the cat, can haphazardly waltz across a computer keyboard found in one of the game\u2019s early chapters. The computer\u2019s monitor will populate with an erratic string of letters, numbers, and symbols. It is, to you or me, incoherent, though I\u2019m sure the cat is very proud of his work. Good job, bud.That\u2019s just one instance of finger-wagging behavior that\u2019ll be immediately recognizable to anyone who\u2019s owned a cat. You can push a beer bottle off a counter or topple a pile of meticulously stacked books. You can shred couches and carpets and closed doors with your claws. In one genuinely hilarious gag, you can get your head stuck in a paper bag. Tilt the thumbstick as you normally would to move, and you\u2019ll instead head in a random direction. Mind, these aren\u2019t just sight gags; they\u2019re legitimate tools for making your way through Stray.Stray, published by Annapurna Interactive and out tomorrow for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC, is the debut game from French development studio BlueTwelve. (Update 08/10/2023: As of today Stray is available on Xbox Series S/X and Xbox One, too.) First announced during the 2020 PS5 reveal event, Stray immediately went viral due to its core gimmick: y\u2019know, that whole \u201cyou play as a cat\u201d thing. I can\u2019t deny getting swept away by the trailer, nor can I deny feeling some level of apprehension. Would the joke translate from the marketing to the real thing?

You can immediately tell these cats are all best friends, spending their days gallivanting around derelict concrete structures, evidently free from human masters who didn\u2019t give them nearly enough canned tuna, probably, the jerks. It\u2019s not long, though, until the cat you control is separated from the pack. It is a heartbreaking moment, seeing this small creature\u2014who does not have a name but is modeled after one of the studio head\u2019s own pets\u2014convey a look of despondent shock upon realizing he\u2019s about to lose his pack. The thrust of the game then becomes bracingly clear: You will do everything in your power to see him reunited with his friends.In Stray\u2019s case, \u201ceverything in your power\u201d more or less means \u201cgetting lost in a sumptuously rendered city\u201d and \u201csolving rudimentary environmental puzzles.\u201dAfter the intro, you wake up in the doldrums of a cyberpunk city. There are no humans anywhere. Instead, the city is populated by robots called Companions, who live in sequestered areas to hide away from a roving scourge of cyclops-eyed rodents who can, and will, consume any sentient life on sight. There are moments of Stray that involve escaping this threat. In some cases, that means galloping your way down an abandoned tunnel to safety. But sometimes it means thinking cleverly, like an actual cat. You can, for instance, meow on command. Doing so will summon the scourge toward you, and if you do it while standing on a ledge (the rodents can\u2019t jump that high), you\u2019ll have a chance to give them the runaround.For most of Stray, you\u2019re accompanied by B12, a sentient drone. B12 can perform many helpful actions the cat cannot\u2014like opening and closing electronic gates, which you can use to trap rodents, allowing you to pass. (Later on, B12 gets a headlight that can incinerate any rodents who walk into its violet glow, though it\u2019s tied to a cooldown.) This contrasting set of talents forms an inextricable bond between B12 and the cat. What starts as a partnership of convenience quickly becomes a true friendship. They need each other.B12\u2019s most invaluable skill is something the cat clearly has no grasp of: language. The linear levels, the stages where you\u2019re running for your life from flesh-eating one-eyed rodents, punctuate stress-free segments where you can explore a neighborhood of the city. B12 can talk to Companions; conversations fill in the blanks of Stray\u2019s sci-fi canon, but also masquerade as instruction.For instance, in one of the game\u2019s (many) bars, I found a sleeping Companion. I knew I needed this robot to wake up. I didn\u2019t know how to make it happen. Later on, while tackling a totally unrelated task, a different Companion mentioned something offhand about how their sleeping friend would only wake up from a big blow to the head. Putting my Clever Cat Powers into overdrive, I went back to the bar, climbed into its rafters, and pushed a crate of bottles onto the sleeping Companion\u2019s head. Voila! Awake.The smartest puzzle games have you banging your head against a desk until, eventually, you crack the solution and feel like a genius. Stray never made me feel like a genius.

Every building is replete with pipes, ledges, fire escapes, jutting A/C units, and other geometry that allows you to scale all the way to the rooftops, giving a true sense of verticality.But it\u2019s not just that. So often, hub areas in games feel like empty pit stops, set dressing for the ultimate\u2014but ultimately banal\u2014goal of increasing your attack stat by 0.05% or whatever. You could reduce them to a series of menus and not lose much.You could not do this to Stray, not without nixing what makes the game so special. Despite not featuring a single human, Stray\u2019s city is one of the most human spaces I\u2019ve ever traversed in a video game.This is almost entirely due to the Companions. Despite very obviously not being human, they act a lot like you and me and everyone we know. They play pool in neon-lit bars and tease each other\u2019s fashion sense. They love music. (Stray\u2019s score, composed by Yann van der Cruyssen, is deliciously jazzy.) I met one who wanted to become a great guitarist but didn\u2019t have the sheet music to do so. I could\u2019ve gone ahead on the main story, but I decided to search around for some sheet music. Every time I found one, the Companion would play me a song. I didn\u2019t get anything from this quest; I don\u2019t even think it increased my \u201cpercentage complete\u201d stat in the game\u2019s progress tracker. It was just\u2026a lovely thing I did for someone else, for someone who sure seemed to act like a human to me.I went into Stray expecting a platformer about a cat. I did not expect a deeply profound meditation on what it means to be alive. Stray adroitly points out how blurry the line is between artificial and natural intelligence, and then runs with that thought experiment all the way to the horizon. Are humans defined by flesh and bones? Thoughts and feelings? The ability to use thumbs and solve problems? It\u2019s gotta be love, right? Can a computer feel love? But wait, what is the human brain if not a series of electronic signals and computations firing away at all times?Unlike its big-budget peers, Stray doesn\u2019t deign to answer these questions, at least not explicitly. But I like to think Stray\u2019s main character actually keyed me into some insight hours earlier, in an early level with a computer and a keyboard: \u201c\\\\setwjhdoixdiwvo%pydjgt.\u201dOh, wait, nope.

But the game\u2019s surprisingly endearing robot companions, and strange, decaying yet vibrant city they inhabit, are also high points. I didn\u2019t expect the setting to draw me in and capture my imagination this much.If you like the sound of a puzzle-adventure game that rewards curiosity and stays fresh the whole way through with a wonderfully fleshed-out world, you\u2019ve gotta play Stray.Stray (PC, PS4, PS5 [reviewed]) Developer: BlueTwelve Studio Publisher: Annapurna Interactive Released: July 19, 2022 MSRP: $29.99Just as a general concept, I was afraid Stray would end up feeling too one-note \u2014 anyone else? Coming into this review, I feel like that\u2019s one of the main questions to answer.It\u2019s something we\u2019ve seen before with games that capture the wider internet\u2019s attention with a flashy idea. And as a fan of more simulation-minded games that try to nail a specific animal\u2019s vibe while still being fun to play, I\u2019ve been burned before, definitely.Stray pulls off the balancing act, though \u2014 it\u2019s inherently engaging to explore as a cat, and the ruined city is a perfect playground. There\u2019s so much space to explore vertically as a nimble cat, yet the \u201cway forward\u201d is never overwhelming or obtuse.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5f02c84-edf4-4381-88ec-0f6e4c0d3e09": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5f02c84-edf4-4381-88ec-0f6e4c0d3e09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee0bcafd-19c5-4d8b-aee5-c903f5eaa7f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4531ceac3154511eed620ecd09e51fae30a6371899c854998fee23b12c48da31"}, "3": {"node_id": "706d011c-ac79-4b87-9508-e491a1157d16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "11efc1d8c5c4b10e33915775898646a7b8d0ca6c7e1ac77b922cdcfbf594a28c"}}, "hash": "2eeb5904302b20b5386d237282c0515fd50ea891b8ce7af9fbb58c09e585a641", "text": "In less capable hands, this game wouldn\u2019t have nearly as much flow, and I think that\u2019s the crucial ingredient.In Stray, if it looks like the cat can leap onto a surface, chances are, it can. And to keep things moving along, instead of manually jumping and landing like in a 3D platformer, you\u2019ll just tap \u201cjump\u201d when you see a visual \u201cland here\u201d prompt. The result is a game about mentally charting a path ahead, rather than one where you need to make meticulous precision jumps. You\u2019ll never worry about falling off, and it all feels believable enough.Early on, in the first of two major hub-like chunks of the city, I spent so much time leaping on pipes, air conditioners, walls, roofs, you name it \u2014 all sorts of stuff that would just be a background detail in any other game. I was determined to find energy drinks to trade with a merchant, sheet music to give to a musician, and collectible \u201cmemories\u201d for my little drone companion, B-12, who is the guiding force for this great-escape story.I didn\u2019t *need* to comb over the Slums to the point of memorization, but I was so absorbed in finding every tucked-away nook and cranny, I didn\u2019t mind \u2014 I was having a blast, and the effort wasn\u2019t wasted. The same can be said for a hustling, bustling later area, Midtown, with a couple of tricky critical-path puzzles to think through. The challenge felt right to me. When in doubt, ask around, and let the neon lights draw your gaze.With your drone\u2019s help, you can communicate with the city\u2019s robots, and easily store puzzle-solving items, presenting them to characters mid-conversation when the situation calls for it. It\u2019s a really streamlined system \u2014 you\u2019re never juggling too many items or worrying about inventory space \u2014 and the NPC chatter is concise, yet personable.The screen-headed bots all have names, and you\u2019ll likely remember them, too; they leave a lasting impression. Grandma, a knitting fiend, is a personal favorite. (Detail-wise, it feels like there\u2019s a reason everything is the way that it is, including the robots\u2019 clothing.)In between the larger zones, you\u2019ll push forward in linear sequences, some of which are hectic chases. The main threat? A ravenous horde of leaping Zurks that even the robots fear \u2014 one of a few elements in Stray that reminds me of the all-time-great Half-Life 2.At first, you don\u2019t have any real recourse other than to run \u2014 or mash a button to shake off the Zurks if they leap on you. Later though, you\u2019ll get a weaponized light to zap \u2019em.Thankfully, in both cases, the developers don\u2019t overdo it with this creepy crawly horde. The Zurks raise the early stakes, for sure, and the action sits nicely alongside the stress-free exploration. But Stray has more up its sleeve in the later chapters. I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s \u201ccombat,\u201d and even if I did, it\u2019s very limited. So if that was a concern (same!), don\u2019t worry.Further in, you\u2019ll need to be sneaky, and I appreciated all the room for stealth slip-ups. If you\u2019re spotted, there\u2019s a chance to leap in a cardboard box. You know, cat stuff.I have to commend the pacing, too. I ended up (happily) finishing Stray in one sitting.That said, the game is longer than I expected \u2014 it took me a good five to six hours. I searched thoroughly in most areas but still came up short on several collectibles.If you know precisely where to go, you could speedrun this game in a couple of hours (there\u2019s a trophy, in fact), but that\u2019s not indicative of a first-time playthrough. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll take me a few more hours to find my missing secrets, and thankfully, there\u2019s a chapter select option after clearing the game, so you can mop up without needing to start over.All around, the scope feels spot-on \u2014 Stray will likely be more expansive than first impressions suggest, but it doesn\u2019t keep tacking on new problems to solve for the sake of it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "706d011c-ac79-4b87-9508-e491a1157d16": {"__data__": {"id_": "706d011c-ac79-4b87-9508-e491a1157d16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "a5f02c84-edf4-4381-88ec-0f6e4c0d3e09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2eeb5904302b20b5386d237282c0515fd50ea891b8ce7af9fbb58c09e585a641"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e12bafd-33bf-4cc4-9f05-daa592a33bff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fd79c4d3b41993ad05210bded39f05392d364da08d64de17c9ee640ecd77003"}}, "hash": "11efc1d8c5c4b10e33915775898646a7b8d0ca6c7e1ac77b922cdcfbf594a28c", "text": "Toward the end, you\u2019ll know when the final moments are near; they arrive right on cue.To really drive it all home, I think Stray would be worth talking about even if you didn\u2019t play as a cat. But because you do \u2014 and because the cat looks and feels and acts exactly as it should \u2014 the game ends up hitting that much harder. At times, it can be emotional without saying a word. The little behavioral details in the animation go so far.Again, you don\u2019t have to be a \u201ccat person\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s a lot to appreciate about this post-human cybercity setting, which feels appropriately lived-in (and doubles as a fun vertical play space). You can tell the creators know the full picture of this universe, but they leave room for our imaginations to fill in certain gaps. Stray ends up feeling complete.This ruined yet hopeful sci-fi world is built in an authentic, thought-through way, and throwing in a normal cat \u2014 who likes to shred couches, knock over paint buckets, and snuggle up in the most random cozy spots \u2014 is such great foil. Playful mischief and other cat tendencies won\u2019t get in the way of you, a human player, feeling like you\u2019re \u201cin control.\u201dStray\u2018s expressive art direction, curious music, stop-and-snap-a-pic lighting, and thoughtful level design coalesce into one of my favorite gaming experiences of the year.I\u2019m so happy Stray exists and that BlueTwelve Studio stuck the landing.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

But Stray doesn\u2019t just let you take control of a character who\u00a0looks\u00a0like a cat\u00a0\u2014 it authentically replicates the dexterity and adorableness of one, too. As you\u00a0nimbly explore its cyberpunk city from his unique point-of-view, you\u2019ll meow, you\u2019ll lovingly cuddle up against NPCs, and you\u2019ll occasionally get your head stuck in a paper bag. It\u2019s all very cute \u2014 that is until the alien headcrabs latch onto your furry skull and suffocate you to death.Stray contrasts its adorable hero with a world that has a disturbing edge. After falling into an underground neon-lit cybercity populated by sentient robots, your quest is to return the cat back to his family on \u201cthe outside,\u201d\u00a0formerly inhabited by extinct humans and now an overgrown wasteland. The aforementioned headcrabs\u00a0\u2014 sorry, \u2018Zurks\u2019\u00a0\u2014 surround the city, as do the mysterious Sentinels, both of which prevent the robots from exploring further. They\u2019re trapped in the world, and now you are, too.Returning to your family requires you to make use of your abilities as a cat, leaping between buildings, crawling into tight spaces, and sneaking by enemies or suspicious citizens.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e12bafd-33bf-4cc4-9f05-daa592a33bff": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e12bafd-33bf-4cc4-9f05-daa592a33bff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "706d011c-ac79-4b87-9508-e491a1157d16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "11efc1d8c5c4b10e33915775898646a7b8d0ca6c7e1ac77b922cdcfbf594a28c"}, "3": {"node_id": "82d6d271-9562-4f11-b627-5b7db3508a35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "10ffadae1903b91d2460e8d6fa72906d7422715553dcbf39d425f372680e4697"}}, "hash": "2fd79c4d3b41993ad05210bded39f05392d364da08d64de17c9ee640ecd77003", "text": "Developer BlueTwelve Studio replicates a cat\u2019s deliberate actions by not letting you freely jump\u00a0\u2014 instead, you\u2019ll be able to reach a ledge when a button prompt appears above it. This might not sound great on paper, but it makes movement feel more considered and, by extension, more cat-like. When you\u2019re closed into a tight corridor that button prompt can have you jumping places you don\u2019t want to, but for the most part, it works as a method of placing you in the cat\u2019s furry paws.For the bigger tasks that would typically require the use of thumbs, you have B-12, a friendly floating droid who accompanies you on your adventure. B-12 proves useful in not only explaining what the hell is going on\u00a0\u2014 the robots communicate in their own language\u00a0\u2014 but also in helping out with things the cat can\u2019t do. He\u2019ll pick up items for you, equip a weapon to use against the Zurks, and generally provide a bit of color commentary as you navigate the world. B-12\u2019s relationship with the cat is sweet, as both work together in their own unique way to solve puzzles and learn more of the strange world they\u2019re thrust into.Puzzles mostly revolve around doing something for a robot civilian in order for them to give you something you need, whether that\u2019s an item or information. These requests can be occasionally obtuse, as they usually require you to go around and talk to many NPCs who may be able to help you out. Often, they can be resolved by using common sense\u00a0\u2014 if you\u2019re asked to find certain items of clothing, then go to the clothes shops and see if you can get them there\u00a0\u2014 but sometimes it can be a guessing game as to how to progress. One such example involving a music tape had me scouring the city for the answer, only for it to be in a place I\u2019d have never guessed.Though its puzzles are on the rudimentary side, they do encourage exploration of your surroundings\u00a0\u2014 and this is where Stray is at its best. Its cybercity is dank and grungy, with impressive moody lighting and a combination of decaying greenery and futuristic tech. Replacing humans with sentient robots was a masterstroke, with them not having seen a cat before and therefore treating him like a friendly alien beamed into their world. They\u2019re unintelligible, so panels on their face reflect their emotions, so when you curl up on one\u2019s chest to join in on their nap, love hearts will appear signifying their affection for you.If bounding between rooftops and snuggling up with robots isn\u2019t cat-like enough for you, then BlueTwelve has added a dedicated meow button and the ability to scratch up carpets and the arms of chairs, should you feel inclined to do so. These are occasionally used for puzzles, but they\u2019re mostly used to simply make you feel more like a cat.\u00a0It works.But it\u2019s not all cute. That Stray begins with the cat falling into the city, being knocked unconscious before limping back to life is a signal of intent. Confrontations with the Zurks and the Sentinels may be infrequent, but when they do happen, the cat can most certainly die \u2014 not a gory death, but a death nonetheless. This, coupled with a story about a parasitic infestation wiping out humankind, means that despite its cuddly hero Stray isn\u2019t exactly for the kids.While it\u2019s good while it lasts, it is all over a little\u00a0too quickly. With a story that can be completed in just under five hours\u00a0\u2014 excluding the extra completionist stuff like collectibles\u00a0\u2014 there are more than a few stones left unturned when it comes to its intriguing world. Though I\u2019m an advocate for games that cut out unnecessary padding, the finale continued to raise questions that I would have liked to explore.When you consider a game that lets you play as a cat, chances are you wouldn\u2019t imagine that game then taking place in a cyberpunk city overrun with headcrabs where humanity has been eradicated and replaced with friendly robots. BlueTwelve has provided a gorgeous and unique setting to match its unique protagonist, and although its action and puzzle-solving may be too simple for some tastes, it excels where it matters\u00a0\u2014 and what matters is making you\u00a0feel\u00a0like a cat.8Paul Tamburro is Editorial Manager at Evolve Media and an Editor-in-Chief of GameRevolution, ComingSoon, PlayStation LifeStyle, and SuperHeroHype.Share article\nShacknews, New to Shacknews?

Login NowStray pounces onto the scene and is good enough to satisfy even the pickiest feline.Going into Stray, my biggest concern was whether the team at BlueTwelve Studio could nail the movement of a cat. As someone who has three, I\u2019m a self-proclaimed expert in not only cat parkour, but also cat behavior. If jumping, walking, or running as a feline were off even a little, I was going to notice, and it was going to annoy me. Stray not only sticks the landing with the movement and mannerisms, but it also successfully immerses you in the role of being a cat in a neon-lit cyberpunk world that transitions from inviting to hostile in the blink of an eye.Stray begins with a tutorial level, teaching you the basic controls as you follow your AI cat friends on an adventure. When a bad fall lands you in the slums of a forgotten city locked away from the rest of the world, you must work to escape and get back to your cat companions. This involves helping a group of robots who are trying to do the exact same thing.By your side \u2013 technically on your back \u2013 throughout your adventures in Stray is a companion called B-12. B-12 acts as a translator since you don\u2019t speak robot and robots don\u2019t speak cat, but can also help with hacking, collecting items, or zapping Zurks, which are annoying little blobs that try to cramp a cat\u2019s style. The two of you will become quite the team, with most gameplay tasks requiring both the skills of a feline and the technological prowess of an AI companion to overcome.You\u2019ll meet B-12 early, and the opening hour or two of Stray is rather calm, with most of it taking place in the slums. This zone is mostly friendly and serves as a location to help you gain allies and get the story moving. Much like the rest of the game, you can sprint through with only objectives on your mind or you can take your time and indulge your cat curiosity. Stray does a fantastic job of allowing you to fully immerse yourself in being a cat and this is never on display more than in its non-hostile zones. You\u2019ll have ample opportunities to sharpen your claws on furniture, drink from puddles, knock over bottles, curl up and nap, or get your head stuck in a bag, which makes navigation complicated.It may sound like normal cat nonsense, but that\u2019s the biggest compliment I can give Stray; there was never a point when I felt like my cat immersion was broken. I constantly noted examples of how the developers nailed everything about cats, including when I told myself to put my tail down as I was proudly displaying my ass for the world to see.Perhaps most impressive was how Stray controlled when one of my nine lives was on the line. There are frantic moments where you must sprint through levels, ducking and dodging Zurks, and others where you\u2019ll sneak by patrolling drones or solve puzzles. No matter what situation I found myself in, behaving like a cat was normally the key to success. I was able to maintain a low profile to sneak by enemies, and I finally understand the power my two-year-old cat must feel when she runs away from me, fully confident that I couldn\u2019t ever catch her. I felt that same arrogance with the Zurks, although I maintain that Zurks are jerks.Because Stray is so good at capturing what cats are like, there were a few emotional moments. One of my cats recently had a health scare, and whenever my virtual feline would get hurt or find itself in a bad situation, I just wanted to scoop it up to protect and cuddle it. The need to protect Stray\u2019s loveable orange tabby is strong.Of course, cats can also be annoying, and in Stray that can occasionally be demonstrated with the jumping, which there is a lot of. You can\u2019t try to jump on just anything. Every object and surface in the world can be valid or invalid in terms of whether you can interact with it. When you\u2019re trying to find a clever way to get from one point to another, this can be frustrating. You might see a pipe you want to jump to, but instead of letting you try and fall, the game just won\u2019t let you try. In that way, Stray most definitely has a formula to it. You can often do things in whatever order you wish so long as you check all the boxes to progress forward.What may fly under the radar for Stray is just how much the entire experience feels hand crafted.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93839d3f-0091-499d-99d9-d40736f33da5": {"__data__": {"id_": "93839d3f-0091-499d-99d9-d40736f33da5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "82d6d271-9562-4f11-b627-5b7db3508a35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "10ffadae1903b91d2460e8d6fa72906d7422715553dcbf39d425f372680e4697"}, "3": {"node_id": "826ce35e-f47e-49b6-a20c-2ac4949db465", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d3526515c5f034da0045e5c8adb745ebed2272ed414c6ad743039e9af4ceab4"}}, "hash": "6cd170b0558f9b7ddef2135d01b661abd9fb12c3237f5e27a4843d5d3af39890", "text": "The more I played, the more I realized that BlueTwelve Studio created a core identity and then remained true to it for every detail that fills Stray\u2019s world.

I found the background music so chill I had to turn it off before it put me to sleep, but Stray\u2019s world is full of music. There\u2019s always someone jamming on the street or a radio that you can switch on with your paw. When you blend it all together to take in the sights and sounds, Stray feels like a living world with interesting places and personalities.If I have a few small gripes about Stray, it\u2019s in the graphics options. I did feel a bit nauseous in my first hour and was bummed to realize that I couldn\u2019t expand the FOV or crank the FPS above 60. I don\u2019t know what was causing me to feel that way but tweaking the FPS and FOV are two good starting points. If you\u2019re going to release a game on PC, unleash it. If I were to do it all again, I\u2019d probably grab Stray on PS5 since I don\u2019t see any huge advantages to playing on PC. Although, I did play on the highest settings and in 1440p, so there is that.When I watched the reveal trailer for Stray, I was expecting it to be fun to run around as a cat, and it is. What caught me off guard is just how detailed and thoughtful the experience was from start to finish. This game is both cute and entertaining, but there is real detail and passion on display that makes it so much more. Stray is a must-play for cat lovers, or anyone who just appreciates a stellar game.This Stray review is based on a Steam key provided by the publisher.

To progress, I must interact with my fellow feline friends, giving them a groom or play fighting with them, before we all curl up together for a catnap. It becomes apparent, very quickly, that these felines are my family.Stray fades to black after this short, but powerful, opening scene. Sure enough, there are tears in my eyes already. You may be thinking that I should get a grip, but I\u2019m a cat person through and through. I haven\u2019t had cats for a few years, but Stray has a funny way of reminding you of every cat you may have ever encountered, past and present, and just how impactful these creatures are on our lives.But this adventure isn\u2019t about me, or any of the cats that I\u2019ve been lucky to care for. Stray is all about the Outsider (our furball), Momo and the Companions, Seamus and his father, and perhaps \u2013 most importantly \u2013 B-12.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "826ce35e-f47e-49b6-a20c-2ac4949db465": {"__data__": {"id_": "826ce35e-f47e-49b6-a20c-2ac4949db465", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "93839d3f-0091-499d-99d9-d40736f33da5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cd170b0558f9b7ddef2135d01b661abd9fb12c3237f5e27a4843d5d3af39890"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e96035a-344e-44b1-ade7-6930dad9c4b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a225aecbfd0a5560f561611355e130571661cfed5cf6f9c2b2e480b0c2013dfb"}}, "hash": "3d3526515c5f034da0045e5c8adb745ebed2272ed414c6ad743039e9af4ceab4", "text": "Stray is a touching tale of loss, loneliness, environmental destruction, and what it means to be human. But Stray is also a story of hope and meaningful connections, and just how important these are to our survival. Whether you\u2019re a cat or not.Once our furry friend parts ways with their family after an unfortunate fall down into Dead City, the real adventure begins \u2013 and what a beautiful journey it is that we end up embarking on. As the first hour or two unfolds, you\u2019re truly whiskered away into the life of roaming around, four-legged, and the immersion at play is exceptional. Especially given that it\u2019s the role of a cat that you\u2019re stepping into, and not \u2013 yet another \u2013 human being.While making progress through The Flat and The Slums, you\u2019ll meet an array of vibrant characters that take the form of robots, and you\u2019ll begin to unravel their individual stories and work out how they fit into the wider narrative. What happened here? Why is the city like this? As you start to paw the narrative threads apart, however, you\u2019re constantly reminded that your protagonist is a cat: knocking over pots of paint, scratching doors or carpets, and nuzzling up to Grandma are just a few of the cat activities that our Outsider can engage in. These can be done standalone, although there are many instances in which they\u2019ll be needed at the height of the action, too.There is a constant reliance on the Outsider\u2019s agility and dexterity, which is needed to progress, and it\u2019s refreshing to see how deeply embedded the abilities of a cat are into the game's mechanics, as well as the environmental design.Producer Swann Martin-Raget described the world as being the \u2018purr-fect playground\u2019 for a cat in our preview. Now, just a few weeks later, I can see exactly what they mean by this sentiment. From The Slums, to Midtown, and all the way to the Prison, Stray\u2019s environment is not only visually stunning, but it\u2019s scattered with platforms and items for our Outsider to take advantage of. Curtains, bins, towers of books. You name it, our cat can probably climb atop it. Or knock it over.Not only do you navigate each chapter by naturally dashing through tiny gaps, jumping elegantly from platform to platform, or leaping across rooftops \u2013 as cats often do \u2013 but the responsibility is often put to you by others that you encounter across The Slums, Midtown, and beyond. These (mostly\u2026) lovely robots that inhabit The Slums, Ant Village, and Midtown will help you on your mission to return home \u2013 but you must help them, too. This means navigating sewers and all other kinds of small and finicky areas that your standard robot wouldn\u2019t be able to get through, and every action feels so valuable and so worthwhile. It almost feels as though your impact on these characters is more important than the real task at hand \u2013 making it back home \u2013 as the automata become so grateful for all that you, a sleek ginger kitty, can do for them.The friendships that unfold as a result of your efforts are incredibly emotive and will stir up something in your soul. Without giving away too much of the tale, you\u2019re not the only one who longs to be back at home with their family and out of The Slums. It appears that everyone here is lonely, at a loss, and longing for some sort of purpose \u2013 a purpose that lies with the outside world. An outside world which everyone has been locked off from, one in which most of our friends didn\u2019t think existed or was safe any more.So, when our Outsider lands in this unfamiliar world, its inhabitants see him as a sign of hope. For many, that\u2019s what our pets are; they\u2019re so much more than four-legged friends and familiars. Animals are family, and for many, they are symbolic of home and safety, too. In Stray, our four-legged Outsider symbolises just that, so there\u2019s no turning back now \u2013 not just for them, but for everyone else we meet along the way too.I mentioned the environment being ideal for a cat, but what I didn\u2019t mention was how detailed it all was. Each chapter of Stray has its own designated zone, and none of them are any less beautiful or inviting than the last. The neon-drenched landscape is littered with platforms, artwork, signs, and even friendly robots. Not only is every alleyway or abandoned home designed for our cat to waltz around in, but they tell their own stories, too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e96035a-344e-44b1-ade7-6930dad9c4b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e96035a-344e-44b1-ade7-6930dad9c4b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "826ce35e-f47e-49b6-a20c-2ac4949db465", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d3526515c5f034da0045e5c8adb745ebed2272ed414c6ad743039e9af4ceab4"}, "3": {"node_id": "68179632-a1c8-4a05-8a36-673894e7685c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "368dafd3738b313186049723f19aa08746db2ad3ea1f1025ed24d0d7686b839f"}}, "hash": "a225aecbfd0a5560f561611355e130571661cfed5cf6f9c2b2e480b0c2013dfb", "text": "When you eventually tire of meowing at security cameras which nod back at you, or have had enough of curling up with Morusque as he plays the sheet music you\u2019ve found for him, you\u2019ll eventually find Momo residing in The Rooftops. Momo and his crew of Outsiders welcome our cute, agile Outsider with open arms once they realise what the adventurous kitty is capable of. Previously committed to finding a way outside, before they eventually gave up, the Outsider provides Momo with a glimmer of hope to keep on going. Here comes our first example of environmental storytelling at its finest.You\u2019ll be tasked with finding some books for Momo sooner or later, and you must visit a few abandoned flats to do so. While prowling each flat, and just about every other area in the game, you can piece together details to work out what happened and who lived there; you don\u2019t need to do this, but as you attempt to find items and make it to the next chapter, you\u2019ll find yourself often entranced by the environment, and doing so anyway. Let\u2019s not forget to mention the fact that many of these flats are littered with mugs to knock over, keyboards to run across, and cow pictures for your viewing pleasure.Exploration is further enhanced by B-12. B-12 is a little droid we find early on in Stray, and he becomes our companion throughout. The bot tracks your objectives, stores items, translates for you, and much more. By the end of the game, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s your best and closest companion. During the main show, B-12 also has us find memories. Who\u2019s memories? I can\u2019t say, but most of these are hidden away in areas you\u2019ll only find by going off the beaten path and exploring, thus encouraging you to spend more time really analysing the environment and just how detailed it is from a cat\u2019s-eye view.Mechanics like this are incredibly important to telling the whole story of Stray, but also so important for encouraging players to look a little harder. To really appreciate the beautiful setting at play and take in the wonderful accompanying synthy soundscape, I\u2019d say it\u2019s critical you go off the critical path \u2013 and often, too. You\u2019ll be so pleasantly surprised and incredibly touched by the details of this strange world and its inhabitants that you can unveil.How long can a game about a cat stay fresh for? Well, I prepared myself for the game to become repetitive, but Stray remains magical. Although, how much can one cat really do? Stray knocked this assumption on its head completely. Even as you advance into the later game, the puzzles and platforming remain fresh as you encounter new environments, new enemies, and new situations to get yourself out of. By the time you\u2019re in The Sewers, pots of paint and scratching doors to get by are a thing of the past, and everything becomes all the more intense. That doesn\u2019t mean our adventure becomes any less about being a cat, though; every challenge is one that only our Outsider could do, and nobody else, and Stray does not let itself down by repeating anything. Everywhere you go, there\u2019s detail to bask in, and new playfully cat-sized tasks to complete. Considering I\u2019ve been catless for a while now, the game was a distinct reminder of just how capable these animals are. They\u2019ll simply never fail to find something to knock over or break, that\u2019s for sure.Stray is a real testament to the passion and dedication of developer, BlueTwelve, and its love for cats. An indie studio founded by two cat-lovers that left Ubisoft to pursue a new project, Stray took seven years to develop and is the studio\u2019s first game \u2013 and I sincerely hope it won\u2019t be their last. It has been wonderful to delve into the life of a cat in such an impeccable environment, and even more charming to get to know every character along the way. The game feels so far from mechanical and is bursting at the seams with love and life, even in a world that seems so far removed from that at times. It\u2019s been a pleasure to be reminded of just how powerful and important animals are to people. The inhabitants of Midtown and below will never forget our Outsider, and yes, I\u2019ll be naming my next cat after Momo.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68179632-a1c8-4a05-8a36-673894e7685c": {"__data__": {"id_": "68179632-a1c8-4a05-8a36-673894e7685c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6aa1aab8-99bd-40b0-964c-d32a033444a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41f28854111461b2a62d2e44a7caa08e4855620a34e08bcd692937e83cc83aa7"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e96035a-344e-44b1-ade7-6930dad9c4b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a225aecbfd0a5560f561611355e130571661cfed5cf6f9c2b2e480b0c2013dfb"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4d84d66-68df-4ec2-ba41-2f27df295985", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a8a08bd3a83ca96b5c5553c1767fbccc8bcd94d9715c43f054e8245d184bba1"}}, "hash": "368dafd3738b313186049723f19aa08746db2ad3ea1f1025ed24d0d7686b839f", "text": "Watch this space.Stray might ultimately be indie in size, but it\u2019s triple-A in quality, and while it may only last eight to 10 hours, it\u2019s a game that has touched me for a lifetime.

We've loved pantomiming as the following: hellraising goats, car-driving bears, and (if you'll allow it into the genre) bendy, walking slices of bread.But three years ago, Untitled Goose Game propelled the genre to its zenith. Its production values, accessibility, and uniquely dry sense of humor were a noticeable step up from the genre's typical \"glitching barnyard animal\" gimmick, and the result was a breakout hit. At that point, I quietly wondered: Where else can video games featuring unexpected animal heroes go?The answer, delivered by this week's Stray, is quite compelling. This brief yet memorable adventure is a refined take on the concept, as if it were made by an arthouse film studio. It lands somewhere\u00a0between the eerie, atmospheric exploration of the first Half-Life and the childlike whimsy of a classic Studio Ghibli film. And it stars a cat: not an unrealistic\u00a0talking cat with bulging eyes and Acme-brand hammers, but a puzzle-solving, nap-taking, tiny-hole-exploring cat who scurries on four paws and pretty much always lands on its feet.Crucially, the developers at the new studio BlueTwelve nail an important contrast. The developer's realistic take on a domesticated virtual cat, as much in its aesthetic as its controls, somehow fits perfectly in a surreal underground world full of robots, neon lights, and mysteries. In fact, this contrast helps the game draw out humor one moment and kindness the next\u2014which is one of many reasons I recommend playing Stray right meow.I'll admit, I've been tempted to unleash all of my favorite cat puns on this review, but that would betray the game's earnestness. Stray aspires to be more than the kind of meme explosion you might expect from \"video game starring a housecat,\" though if it makes you feel any better, the names of the game's achievements and trophies are utter groaners. (When your unnamed cat gets trapped at one point, an achievement lights up with the phrase \"Al-Cat-Traz.\")Stray's zero-dialogue introduction suggests that players are in for an isolated experience, one where you\u2014and your dedicated \"meow\" button\u2014traverse an empty world with little response. Fortunately, the game changes up its scenery, and you eventually land (yes, on all fours) in a world with its own language and social norms.Conveniently, one of its residents takes a liking to you, then figures out that it can open up communication between you and everyone else... if it slips a high-tech harness over your body. As a cat, you immediately\u00a0hate\u00a0this thing, and you visibly struggle, the way you'd expect from any cat being forced by an owner to, say, dress up like a character from Firefly. (\"Who's my little Meow-colm Reynolds? You are!\") But after some squirming, you make peace with the device since it opens up your ability to understand what's going on. The harness doesn't convert your noises into words, however. This thing only offers one-way communication. That's one way to stick to a Gordon Freeman archetype.Your appearance suggests to everyone that there may be an escape from this sunless, underground world\u2014as you're somehow able to evade certain nasty monsters found between the environment's outposts. \"Can you help us?\" becomes a common refrain among the people you chat with. As a cat, you can get into places that the people you meet cannot, so you're often asked to slink around and find lost items or occasionally examine the world around you to solve puzzles like deciphering a code for a safe.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.
