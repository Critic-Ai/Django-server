Taking place some 15 years after Techland's parkour-fuelled 2015 open world original, it's set against a world completely ravaged by the viral outbreak that began back in Harran, where disputes are solved with a rusty iron pipe to the head and the people holed up in the small number of mediaeval settlements barricaded against the breakout are well beyond hope (this is a grimly prescient thing in more ways than one). With its streets lined by crumbled concrete, patrolled by renegades in hockey masks and spiked leather jackets and where the surly survivor's wardrobes seems to come entirely from Wickes, Dying Light 2 has an aesthetic that's straight out of a second tier Xbox 360 game. It's light on innovation but Dying Light 2 has the scope and breadth of your modern triple-A, rippling with systems and overwhelming in size. It looks and feels like the most ambitious Xbox 360 game ever made, and I'm fairly certain I mean that as high praise.Coming seven years after the original game and now armed with a new and often outrageous scope, it's a modern blockbuster in more ways than one, complete with a bulging grab bag of systems lifted from triple-A successes of recent years and like too many other modern blockbusters it comes with a turbulent development mired by high profile departures and reports of dire management. This is a broad, brutal thing, occasionally rough-edged, yet for all its stumbles it is massively entertaining. Put a lot of that down to the fundamentals of the original, which provide the foundation and are here newly finessed. Underpinning Dying Light 2 is the same heavily pronounced day/night cycle: under sunlight the streets are speckled with the stumbling infected, while building interiors are awash with them; by night they come out and those streets are more ferocious still, and mere survival until sunrise becomes your priority, with safe houses and spots doused in UV light acting as respite.These mad dashes to safety in the midnight hours are where Dying Light 2's systems come into focus, and indeed where Dying Light 2 is at its best. The first-person parkour is simply brilliant, its integration into a vast, dense open world simply astonishing, and the act of getting from A to B is an absolute thrill. As in the original, the parkour moveset is slow to build momentum with the bulk of abilities unlocked via a skill tree - it took about 20 hours for me to unlock the simple slide that allowed me to scoot through small spaces, and another dozen or so to have the full suite of wall-running skills - but by the end you're pouncing from wall to wall like a panther, tying together dazzling runs from rooftop to rooftop. It's sublime. This is a stubbly Mirror's Edge with knuckledusters on, and it's to Techland's credit that they've managed to serve that moveset so well with its open world - something DICE sadly stumbled at itself with Catalyst. Get stuck in the quagmire of the streets and you might trigger off a chase that escalates in stages, GTA-style, where you'll bound from car bonnet to a fire escape before scuttling away to the rooftops in one swift succession. The amount of traversal options available to you at any one time is simply staggering, and that it holds together at all feels like an outstanding achievement in itself. As a first-person platformer, it's hard to think of anything that can match what Dying Light 2 achieves (though there'll always be a place in my heart for the OG, the PlayStation's dear Jumping Flash). At various points in the campaign there might be windmills to climb to unlock new safe zones, or TV towers to ascend, and they provide platform challenges that unfold gratifyingly. Yes, someone's been kind enough to paint every ledge you might be able to latch onto in bright yellow, yet there's still some thought that needs to be put into planning the path upwards, the best challenges and parkour runs putting to mind the fleet-footed Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.It's not flawless, with a persistent stickiness to ziplines and fuzziness to movements that can sap some of that momentum. There's the sense, too, that the ambition isn't always matched by the execution - there's a light Metroidvania touch in Dying Light 2, amongst its myriad other influences, as you collect Inhibitors ferreted around the map to unlock more health or stamina so that you can perform greater feats of athleticism and scale buildings that bit easier, but it's something only ever gestured towards rather than fully realised. The deftness of traversal is in bold contrast to the clumsy ferocity - intentional, that is - of Dying Light 2's combat.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34dba128-add9-4fb1-9bcf-8a1a95a03f59": {"__data__": {"id_": "34dba128-add9-4fb1-9bcf-8a1a95a03f59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "3da57aa9-864b-4d63-b19d-e8ef50e93413", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "de1f1a3d4d1c0b148edb26e89329efba96865f7faf181c0aa7dee184053ec947"}, "3": {"node_id": "d71d921d-6a20-4b46-be4b-e8d8ad7ba3ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef1f0b6a7593fc90457aea8cbb4d59683822dccd6822244721cb3b51856fd7e5"}}, "hash": "302be6ca7daacc141279dd7de0988840d353fcaecf88f3ea331225548633642e", "text": "This is a game pointedly without guns, excused in the narrative by a world that's lost the expertise to craft weapons, which means to get things done in Dying Light 2 you'll have to get your hands dirty. Which is just as satisfying, in its own way, as the parkour; there's a cathartic crunch to melee battle, given a fierce edge by the weapons which can be modded out via blueprints. Because in this game there are hatchets, and then there are hatchets with fizzing shock mods in the shaft and spitting flames at the edges. Combat is served by its own skill tree, with the same slow trickle of new movesets unlocked by the combination of specific XP and how much health you've available. There are deliberate choices to be made in how you build your own character, pushing them towards either athleticism or bare-knuckled brutishness, and it's a choice that even extends to the open world itself. Within Dying Light 2 there are factions you can ally yourself with, the city changing in tune to those choices. Pick one side and they might strengthen up the defences on the infected-infested lower levels; pick another and you'll unlock more options up on the rooftops, with parkour equipment being put in place or putting big yellow trampolines on the streets that propel you skywards (why you wouldn't opt for the trampolines is beyond me). Choice is something paramount to the story, with main character Aiden Caldwell's underlying quest to find his sister Mia providing the main thread, out of which Dying Light 2 spins so much. It's a story told predominantly in shades of grey, presumably to give space for your own input, though sadly the results tend towards incoherence more than moral ambiguity. Caldwell himself is a non-entity - again, presumably by design - though that's more on the writers than voice actor Jonah Scott. There's too much grit and never enough character for Dying Light 2's story moments - of which there are many - to land, but what's there does at least give the sprawl of Dying Light 2 a human heart, kept pumping along by standout turns from Jonathan Forbes' Hakon and Rosario Dawson's Lawan. There are big story choices that have big consequences - with branching dialogue moments upon which your own plot line will pivot even if it still feels like it funnels towards the same endpoint. It's bluntly done but impactful nevertheless, the overall effect like a Fallout-lite.Away from the main quest line, there's plenty to do. I guess the measure of an open world is how easy it is to get distracted within it, and Dying Light 2 excels here. Some of the best evenings I've had with it have been idly running through the city at night, rescuing stragglers and raiding night stores while occasionally picking up a side story thread to pick at, or simply ticking off the numerous parkour challenges. Here's a blockbuster, also, that only blossoms if you persevere. The prologue is a little overlong, the first area that houses the first dozen hours or so is a little dreary, but push through some leaden pacing and Dying Light 2 brightens at its core. In the vaster map around The City's centre there's variety and colour in abundance. It's a post-apocalypse that's told in the same lushness of The Last of Us, and can even be a quite pretty thing.There are stumbles here and there - including infrequent technical issues, which again seem synonymous with the territory of a game of this scope, with models infrequently popping awkwardly into each other or levitating a few feet from the ground - but they're infrequent enough to be overpowered by the ambition of everything else that's in play. Dying Light 2 is not exactly an innovative game, but it's one that throws so much together with an enthusiasm that is, if you'll pardon the pun, infectious. Even more commendably, for the most part it sticks. I can't pretend to be an expert in big blockbuster games - the bloat and overstated breadth isn't exactly to my taste - but Dying Light 2, with its varied systems lifted wholesale from elsewhere, is a welcome reminder of how hugely entertaining they can be. There's a brutality to its breadth, to the vastness of its world - this is the triple-A experience served up with the subtlety and grace of a modified hammer to the head. It's rarely elegant, but it is most definitely enjoyable. \n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d71d921d-6a20-4b46-be4b-e8d8ad7ba3ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "d71d921d-6a20-4b46-be4b-e8d8ad7ba3ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "34dba128-add9-4fb1-9bcf-8a1a95a03f59", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "302be6ca7daacc141279dd7de0988840d353fcaecf88f3ea331225548633642e"}, "3": {"node_id": "457c4450-18ac-4a74-b81a-8e1215360a04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "11bbed56debbaaaa726187976449dc283be91f276cefa0ae1c7993957fdb8a85"}}, "hash": "ef1f0b6a7593fc90457aea8cbb4d59683822dccd6822244721cb3b51856fd7e5", "text": "Find out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nMartin Robinson\n\n          Contributor\n        Martin worked at Eurogamer from 2011 to 2023.

A first-person open world parkour action game set in the zombie apocalypse.\nExpect to pay: $60/\u00a354.99\nDeveloper: Techland\nPublisher: Techland\nReviewed on: RTX 2080, Intel i7-9700K , 16GB RAM\nMultiplayer: Co-opI land a flying two-footed kick into a bandit and send him screaming off the edge of a roof and onto the zombie-filled streets below. Over the past 50 hours of Dying Light 2, this has become my singular goal: kick dudes off roofs. The city is in peril from far more than just zombies, I have a half-dozen unfinished side-quests in my journal, and my map is littered with icons imploring me to scavenge resources, discover new locations, and undertake parkour challenges.\u00a0Sorry. Can't do any of that right now. Somewhere in the city another bandit is standing too close to the edge of another rooftop.And reaching that rooftop is just as much fun as kicking someone off it. To get there I slide down ziplines and bounce off jump-pads, swing like Spider-Man from the rope of my grappling hook, sail through the air with my fold-up paraglider\u2014or I just climb, clamber, wall-run, and ledge-grab my way there. Dying Light 2 is a huge and exhilarating playground for crunchy, kinetic, two-footed combat and satisfying first-person parkour. It doesn't start out like that\u2014there's a few long hours before the game really opens up and gets fun, and there's a lot of not-so-great storytelling along the way. But it's worth it.Welcome to the European city of Villedor, a sprawling mess of decaying and crumbling buildings with scores of zombies shambling through the streets and pockets of survivors camped out in barricaded safe zones. As Aiden, a travelling do-gooder (called a pilgrim), I've arrived in search of my long-lost sister, Mia, following several convenient flashbacks that show we were the victims of medical experiments as children before being separated. After discovering a vaccine for the original zombie virus, scientists continued messing around until they goofed big-time and unleashed an even deadlier version of the disease upon the world. One particularly evil scientist, a man named Waltz, may hold the key to finding my long-lost sister and my long-delayed revenge.To find Waltz, I need to ingratiate myself with the locals, who are distrustful of outsiders and only give out information in exchange for favors, though thankfully those favors often involve kicking jerks off rooftops. There are two main factions in Villedor\u2014the Survivors, a grubby yet hearty clan who build little farms and safe zones on the rooftops, and the Peacekeepers, who dress in blue combat gear and act like the cops of the apocalypse. When Aiden arrives the two groups are at odds owing to the recent unsolved murder of a Peacekeeper commander, and it's not long before Aiden's eager-to-help attitude gets him wrapped up in the drama between the factions.I'm not yet a dynamo of flying kicks and fluid parkour when I arrive in Villedor. I'm a complete klutz, a disgrace to the art of climbing walls and running on rooftops. The first few hours of Dying Light 2's feel shaky, slow, and clumsy\u2014I miss my jumps frequently, hesitate at the ledge of every building before leaping, frequently run out of stamina while climbing, and hammer away at zombies with ineffectual weapons like table legs and baseball bats. Progression is slow: every enemy I kill and wall I climb sends a trickle of combat and parkour XP into my bank, and only once I've leveled up those talents am I given a single point to unlock a new move from the two skill trees.Whereas a game like Far Cry 6 would have thrown loads of exciting weapons and skills at me immediately, in my first 10 hours of Dying Light 2 I'd only added a couple of extra moves to my arsenal. But I'm kind of into that. It makes progress feel earned, something I really have to struggle to accomplish, and it makes deliberating over which skill to pick feel important. Each time I had a point to spend, I really had to consider what would have helped the most while I was getting my ass kicked for the past few hours. And most skills are distinct and useful enough to change the way I approach both fights and parkour.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "076b6bf2-4d9a-4d5b-8c88-26ac13c561de": {"__data__": {"id_": "076b6bf2-4d9a-4d5b-8c88-26ac13c561de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "457c4450-18ac-4a74-b81a-8e1215360a04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "11bbed56debbaaaa726187976449dc283be91f276cefa0ae1c7993957fdb8a85"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb0a8218-8682-40f2-b9eb-e13cc70607dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a61aeaeb5eaedb650421ec61e8584d406434836aa1033f2c423e0715e4bed5d"}}, "hash": "272209d64ec222bebfb14464f42c1b0f00630ba0adc6dda9b69a42c769dd536d", "text": "Along with my beloved flying two-footed kick, there's more fun foot-related skills: a vault kick, which lets me use a stunned foe as a springboard to launch myself, boots-first, into his comrade (and if my kick stuns him I can simply turn around and springboard back to deliver another kick to the first guy). An air kick lets me target a foe from above, leap down, and drive my foot into his face in glorious slow motion. There's a satisfying headstomp for mashing a fallen enemy's brains into goo, and even a move that lets me run right into a dude, knock him off a roof, and ride his body all the way to the ground, smashing his skull into the pavement. I know, it's not a kick, but it's still an awesome (and hilarious) finisher and a stylish way to get down to street level.You don't have to kick everyone to death: there's a steady supply of sharp, rusty, and spiky melee weapons to collect along with bows and throwing knives for ranged attacks, and explosives like mines and grenades. I grew pretty attached to my gleaming two-handed axe called the Heavy Duty, not just because it could hew off arms, legs, and heads while providing me with a stamina regeneration bonus and a damage bonus when I was at low health, but because it had three sockets I filled with craftable weapon mods that did electrical and toxic damage, turning critical hits into gloriously gory and effective strikes. I liked it so much I installed a third mod that increased its durability.\u00a0You can't repair weapons in Dying Light 2, but I never had one break\u2014by the time my favorite weapons were degrading from use there were newer, deadlier ones to buy or find. I replaced the Heavy Duty in favor of the Bad Gal, a katana that did bonus damage at night and even more bonus damage during the day. I crafted another mod that meant crits would set an enemy on fire, which could spread to an entire mob. Kicking bandits off a roof is even more fun when they're bleeding and on fire.There are also great single-use \"opportunity weapons\" scattered around enemy encounters, like spears that can be snatched from corpses and quickly flung into an enemy for a one-hit kill, or bottles and bricks that can be grabbed and thrown to stun or stagger someone, giving big brawls a fun, improvised feel. And weirdly, my favorite weapon turned out to be the only gun in the game, called the Boomstick. It's only useful for a single shot and costs so much scrap metal to craft that I didn't fire it for hours\u2014until a ridiculous bandit boss wearing a bird costume sucker punched me. It barely hurt him, but after hours spent hitting people with clubs and hatchets it felt great to blast him right in the beak.A slick, unbroken run across a district's rooftops makes me feel almost superhuman.Parkour progression doesn't feel quite as great as adding new combat skills or weapons\u2014at first. It focuses on more practical needs like being able to roll after hitting the ground, or popping back up immediately after landing, or skills that let you leap a bit further or climb a bit quicker. But those skills add up and eventually make movement much more fluid, which gives me plenty of confidence. Being able to slide through a low gap instead of ducking and walking under it never saved my life, but it sure as hell feels good. The city eventually begins to feel less like a bunch of obstacles and more like a jungle gym, and a slick, unbroken run across a district's rooftops makes me feel almost superhuman.There are more tools to navigate the city that only arrive about halfway through the main story quests, like the paraglider I can use to sail over rooftops, steering into updrafts from air vents to extend my flight and open up an exciting new avenue of travel. It's also the perfect way to escape clawing zombie mobs. Eventually I get a grappling hook, too, not a Just Cause-type for yanking myself through the air but one I can sink into an object above me and swing across gaps with like Indiana Jones. With all of these tools in play Villedor becomes a brilliant playground, a massive, zombie-filled puzzle I can solve by climbing, leaping, gliding, and swinging, whether I'm on a quest or just exploring.I haven't really mentioned the zombies much because, well, they're a bit boring and fighting them isn't nearly as much fun as mixing it up with living humans.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb0a8218-8682-40f2-b9eb-e13cc70607dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb0a8218-8682-40f2-b9eb-e13cc70607dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "076b6bf2-4d9a-4d5b-8c88-26ac13c561de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "272209d64ec222bebfb14464f42c1b0f00630ba0adc6dda9b69a42c769dd536d"}, "3": {"node_id": "3ed2620b-4b14-4c21-879e-68e80055c17f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7084ff86cde6492ad9f33b98d0a7bc690f2347b6ffb89249929183757b0f73c0"}}, "hash": "6a61aeaeb5eaedb650421ec61e8584d406434836aa1033f2c423e0715e4bed5d", "text": "Some zombies shamble slowly, some swarm quickly, and there are zombie specials, like howlers who attract mobs, spitters who pelt with ranged attacks, lurching blobby ones who explode, and enormous, slow-moving tanks that ground-pound and windmill with giant fists. In the daytime they rarely feel like much of a threat once I've gotten good at parkour, but as in the original Dying Light, nighttime changes everything.When night falls traversing the city becomes incredibly dangerous as all the zombies who avoid daylight head out onto the streets, much meaner and faster than their daytime counterparts. But night also means the interiors of buildings are easier to navigate since most of the hordes are outside. Nighttime activities reward you with more loot and increased XP, so it's a real risk-vs-reward prospect. It's also a fantastic way to add tension. Creeping past slumbering zombies who might wake up at any moment or scuttling across rooftops hoping I don't do anything to make noise and alert the mob always has me holding my breath. And finishing up a long mission and realizing night has nearly fallen is a real oh-shit moment, followed by a mad dash to a safe zone as warning bells sound across the city and the howls of the undead begin rising in my ears. Parkour while panicking is the true test of your skills.Along with the tools to navigate the city, there's a system to change it as well. Throughout Villedor's many districts are buildings to conquer like water towers and electrical substations. These buildings form excellent parkour puzzles, especially in the electrical buildings, where you have to connect cables between a series of transformers. The cables have a fixed length, so simply winding them through corridors and up ladders won't reach. Instead, you have to find the most efficient parkour route from the cable's source to its correct transformer. Some of these puzzles are pretty intricate, and after vaulting and climbing and swinging around it's a great feeling to finally plug in that final cable and complete the puzzle.These choices are about getting to shape the city into the type of playground you want.Then you'll have to decide if you want to give control of the building to the Peacekeepers or the Survivors. Each building you turn over to the Peacekeepers will add something to turn the city streets into a playground of traps\u2014car bombs you can detonate, turrets that fling sawblades, exploding lanterns, electrical and pendulum traps\u2014all great if you love dramatically wiping out mobs of zombies on street level. If you're more into parkouring far above the zeds, giving control to the Survivors means there will be more ziplines, jump pads you can bounce up to the roofs with, airbags you can grab and ride to the ground, extra air vents for your glider, and other parkour-related features which make navigating the city quicker and easier. This system completely undercuts any character drama you've been involved in\u2014if you hate the Peacekeepers it may feel strange to hand over control of a building to them. But these choices are about getting to shape the city into the type of playground you want, and that's honestly more important (at least to me) than which side you align with.Dying Light 2 co-op: How to play with friends\nDying Light 2 skills: Which to choose\nDying Light 2 tips: Outrun the zombie apocalypse\nDying Light 2 Inhibitors: Boost your stamina and health\nDying Light 2 safe codes: Don't miss any lootSpeaking of character drama, there's a boatload of it. The story quests will take you back and forth through the city, bookended by lengthy cutscenes as you help out the Survivors and Peacekeepers and occasionally choose which side to favor. The writing isn't the worst I've seen by a long shot, but it's not particularly good, either. It's about the quality of a typical zombie film, really, so maybe that's fitting. On the plus side, Dying Light 2 is refreshingly okay with killing off its characters, even many of the main ones. There was a guy who was constantly an utter dick to me and I fully expected to have to win him over at some point, just because he was part of the faction I was helping. Nope! I got to kill him myself. Avoiding a redemptive story arc for this creep was an absolute treat.There are a handful of characters I enjoyed. I met a big, bearded, hulking peacekeeper who looked like he'd be a mindless brute but was actually quite thoughtful and clever. There's a lieutenant who seems like he'd be a real hardass but eventually shows a bit of humor and fondness for his troops.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ed2620b-4b14-4c21-879e-68e80055c17f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ed2620b-4b14-4c21-879e-68e80055c17f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb0a8218-8682-40f2-b9eb-e13cc70607dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a61aeaeb5eaedb650421ec61e8584d406434836aa1033f2c423e0715e4bed5d"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ec931f0-818a-496e-b860-6fcaae6622b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "da7c6981859bf1c4d6187b5cadae146c2db84b35bef00665c943df37e6aba14f"}}, "hash": "7084ff86cde6492ad9f33b98d0a7bc690f2347b6ffb89249929183757b0f73c0", "text": "Rosario Dawson stands out as the character of Lawan, basically the Alyx Vance of Villedor in that she seems oddly untouched by the apocalypse, upbeat and charming, a nice change from the overly gruff soldiers and gloomy survivors. And there are a few surprises I didn't see coming, both in side-quests and the main story.I got a strong performance with my RTX 2080 and 16GB RAM, running Dying Light 2 with a solid 80-90 fps all over the city on high settings. Unfortunately I wasn't playing the final version of the game: the build was patched twice during the week I played and I expect there will be a Day One patch as well. One story quest in particular was bugged for me: a character needed to complete an optional task was stuck in the wrong location and non-responsive, which meant having to advance a side-quest before he'd return to his correct position for the main quest. Instead of pop-in, I weirdly had some pop-out: sometimes zombies would simply disappear from exterior locations. At times icons for locations I'd discovered on the map would vanish, and one utility building I'd cleared wouldn't register as completed, but overall there was little in the way of bugs that really disrupted my experience.A few other issues: UI like menus and inventory are clearly built with consoles in mind and are weirdly laid out, and while many controls are remappable on the keyboard, a few important ones are not\u2014I can middle-mouse to use my grappling hook, but it's also bound to Alt which there's no option to change.Before launch developer Techland said Dying Light 2 would take players 500 hours to fully complete, not just the main story quests but sidequests, challenges, activities, secrets, etc. After playing I almost believe it. Dying Light 2 is a big game, y'all. The city is simply massive, filled with activities and random encounters and rooftop skirmishes, and even with a glider and other parkour toys just crossing a single district takes a good long time. Villedor is even bigger than a cursory glance of the map suggests because there are regions that sprawl well outside the borders. After finishing the story I ran along the edge of a district and discovered there's a whole underwater portion of the city I didn't even know existed. This game is huge.After the 50 hours it took me to complete the main quest, about a dozen sidequests, and a bunch of other activities, I still have plenty to do in Dying Light 2, and I'm keen to keep playing. Hell, even after wrapping up the story there are still a bunch of skills I haven't unlocked, quests I haven't begun, and large sections of the city I've barely set foot in\u2014not to mention plenty of bandits I've yet to set foot on.A underwhelming story but a massive, exciting sandbox of parkour and kinetic combat.Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

It\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t come out two years ago, because it does feel very much like a last gen game, no matter what you play it on, but the massive game world and an ambitious use of branching narrative offers an additional layer of freedom in a genre that is beginning to feel increasingly stale and predictable.Dying Light 2 does reuse plenty of tropes from Ubisoft style open world games, including a map (and HUD) littered with icons of nearby points of interest, while the zombie setting is by now painfully overused. This sequel does its best to compensate for those problems, but the irony is it still needed a little more time in the oven.The original Dying Light barely had a story, but in the sequel you play as a \u2018Pilgrim\u2019, essentially an on-foot courier who delivers items between the few stable settlements left in the wake of a global zombie pandemic. The opening hour of the game takes place outside the largest remaining city (vaguely implied to be somewhere in Eastern Europe) as the game teaches you the basics of the controls and you end up being bitten by a zombie during your attempt to get in.This is not the life-ending problem you would imagine though, as everyone in Villedor is bitten and has a device on their wrist to indicate whether they\u2019re about to turn or not, which can be prevented by exposing yourself to UV light.You play as one Aiden Caldwell (so there\u2019s no character customisation) who has been experimented on by a comically evil scientist and is trying to find his sister, who he was separated from while they were both young. Despite all the different people that have worked on it though the script still feels very stodgy and inorganic, with much of the voice-acting being similarly unrefined.That\u2019s the set-up though and if you\u2019re familiar with the previous game, or Techland\u2019s work on Dead Island, you\u2019ll be able to imagine that it involves an awful lot of fetch quests carried out on the behalf of complete strangers. There is an obvious attempt to increase the mission variety but nevertheless a lot of it involves being told to go to a certain location and retrieve a piece of loot, or dispatch a human or zombie enemy.Thankfully, the processes for doing so are much more interesting than the contrivances for why you\u2019d ever be wandering about after dark, which is when the zombies begin to swarm. They\u2019re still out and about in daylight (you would\u2019ve thought there\u2019d been ample opportunity to wipe them all out by the time the story begins, but apparently not) but at night you\u2019ll end up being chased by hordes of the creatures, including several specialist types that are faster, stronger, or which act as beacons to call others.You can defend yourself, primarily with melee weapons that can be modified with gadgets to make them electrified or shoot flames, but in most cases there\u2019s too many to comfortably deal with and running is the only option. That\u2019s a good thing though as the chases are by far the most thrilling part of the game, as you leg it towards a safe house with a hundred zombies at your back.Parkour seems to have fallen out of fashion lately but, thanks to the delays, it\u2019s front and centre in Dying Light 2. It works very well too, despite this being a first person game (the strange flailing of your arms, just at the edge of the screen, can look very silly at times). There\u2019s enough leeway to the jumps that you\u2019ll be sprinting and leaping across the rooftops within just a few minutes, plus you can also fight using parkour moves \u2013 using enemies as launch pads to attack others with powerful kicks and other unlockable abilities.Although it borrows a lot from Bethesda games like Fallout and Skyrim, including some offputtingly weird facial animation, Dying Light 2 isn\u2019t really an action role-playing game, because you have no stats.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5a9da1ea-9a15-483f-ae69-c933fc636d5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5a9da1ea-9a15-483f-ae69-c933fc636d5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ec931f0-818a-496e-b860-6fcaae6622b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "da7c6981859bf1c4d6187b5cadae146c2db84b35bef00665c943df37e6aba14f"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab079bc9-f6a0-4920-98dc-8de896e71167", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b04b9513f2add0d741503f4c71b5db84c2330ce2153d2519746e23a9d2c763e"}}, "hash": "6dc0bf57a133384b285e24d17e37ef03b51ba8d78b3b948c0fa3624ae6d9b356", "text": "However, you do level up as you unlock more combat and parkour abilities, with the level of enemies clearly indicated on-screen, so that you know whether you have a chance against them or not.Mechanically speaking, Dying Light 2 is competent but not in a way that fully justifies a 30+ hour game (Techland initially boasted it would take over 500 hours to see everything, until they quickly realised that put off more people than it attracted, given how much bloat it implies). The combat is fine, and the parkour works well, but the stealth is so simplistic it often breaks your suspension of disbelief.It\u2019s the chases and the fact that, at night, you often have a clock ticking down until you become fully infected that brings the game to life. That tension is probably going to be somewhat lost when you\u2019re playing in co-op, but that option wasn\u2019t available to test pre-launch.The game\u2019s final trump card is the way your story decisions affect the plot and the world around you. There are several different factions vying for control of the city and while you can play them all against each other, inevitability you\u2019ll end up coming down on the side of one or another.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationYour decisions affect not just who\u2019s in control but the lives of non-player characters and what parts of the city remain inaccessible or not. Although this is undermined by the fact that it\u2019s hard to care about most of the characters thanks to the clunky dialogue and tonal inconsistencies, which veer from deadly serious to goofy and silly at a moment\u2019s notice.The script really could\u2019ve done with more more work but while that\u2019s unlikely to happen there will have to be a lot of patches to fix all the game\u2019s bugs. We\u2019ve seen a lot worse pre-launch but it\u2019s still common for characters to glitch in and out of existence or story missions to not start or complete as they should.Dying Light 2 is too long, and its action elements and atmosphere can be very one-note, but if you\u2019ve been waiting this long for the game you\u2019re unlikely to be disappointed with the results. Despite the storytelling improvements the game still needs a better script, and if you\u2019re worried you\u2019re bored of zombies this will do little to restore your enthusiasm for them, but it does succeed in achieving something at least a little different with its well-worn premise.In Short: A little rough around the edges, especially in terms of the storytelling, but the interminable wait for this open world zombie sequel has been worth it.Pros: Parkour, including parkour combat, is a lot of fun and the branching narrative works very well. The chases and failing immunity at night are great at creating tension.Cons: A lot of busywork and repetitive missions, and while the combat is good the enemies are rarely very interesting. Weak script and unremarkable art design. Undercooked stealth and lots of bugs.Score: 7/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed), Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and PCPrice: \u00a354.99Publisher: TechlandDeveloper: TechlandRelease Date: 4th February 2022 (Switch TBA)Age Rating: 18Email\u00a0gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and\u00a0follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : Dying Light 2 offers free next gen upgrade but no console cross-play\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Dying Light 2 goes gold \u2013 will absolutely launch in February\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Dying Light 2 is really only 20 hours long insist Techland as fans complain of bloat\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and email us at\u00a0gamecentral@metro.co.ukFor more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGamesRadar+, When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

So, yeah, it's big. Techland may have panicked at the bad reaction to their promise of 500 hours to 100% everything but it's absolutely that game. The studio quickly backtracked, saying you could clear the story and side missions in about 80 hours, which matches my final completion time for the campaign and a range of side stuff. Even completing it with a varied chunk of stuff under my belt, and having seen plenty, I still feel like I barely dented it in places. As I continue to mop up and explore, there are bits of foggy map I've barely touched.\u00a0Release date: February 4, 2022\nPlatform: PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series 1, PC\nDeveloper: Techland\nPublisher: TechlandIt's a big game then and, for the most part, a good one. There are some issues I'll get to later but nothing that puts me off recommending it. It's an enjoyable open world zombie game that realises that core fantasy well as you try to survive its corpse infested city: exploring, seeing what you can find, picking up missions at random, and - when all hell breaks loose - making split second fight or flight decisions as you run through streets full of undead. When the tools and skills you unlock click you can enter a total flow state - pivoting on a footfall to avoid danger or leaping from rooftops without looking down, confident you can fix the issue before it's too late. Things like a paraglider let you soar across buildings, while a grapple hook can be flung out in a heartbeat to swing across gaps with barely a thought. When it all falls into place you can just sort of wake up blinking at the end of a mission not entirely sure how you got through it.\u00a0Combat can have moments like these too, especially when you nail dodges and blocks. But the system is muddied in the mid-to-late story by too many enemies layering too many attacks. At the start it's all about using blocks to stun opponents and vault over them to unleash a devastating two-footed kick that gives Deathloop some competition - enemies crunch into walls or fly from rooftops, to soar for a few beautiful parabolic seconds until the ground gets involved. The entire first half's fighting is shaped by waiting for the perfect moment to hoof enemies into oblivion. Later, though, human opponents increase in numbers and they start to feint attacks, add in unblockable strikes, and attack at range with bows. These layers quickly overwhelm in larger encounters and the beautiful precision of \u00a0smaller street scuffles becomes more of a desperate mash to gain control. Where your increasing freerunning skills constantly feel more empowering, I oddly found combat against the living frustrating the further I got in, despite growing power and skills.\u00a0Overall, though, day to day existence in the world is good, with plenty to discover throughout the map. However the story, characters and your ability to impact any of it is less impressive. Only a few people have any memorable presence or charisma, for example, while the writing is all over the place in terms of quality (possibly due to the removal of a big name writer after harassment accusations). There are plenty of questionable performances, especially with side quest characters delivering lines that appear to never have been read out loud until they were recorded - odd phrases and vocabulary choices that probably looked fine in print but sound weird and unnatural off the tongue. (Both \"dying light\" and \"stay human\" are worked into conversation at one point for fans of 'people saying the title of the thing'.)A lot of character interaction feels disconnected from the game as well, or unaware of what might be on the screen when it was said - confirming things verbally rather than visually. When asking to help a woman she immediately replies \"To help with what? My poverty? My drinking problem?\". There are a lot of strange moments like this where characters clumsily lever unprovoked backstory into a simple fetch request. I can't tell if it was rushed or written around elements of the game that couldn't be changed. It's far from ruinous but can break immersion and often feels like you're meeting theme park performers reciting lines to keep the show moving rather than real people living in a world.\u00a0There's also a scattering of odd semi-misogynistic, sexist dialogue; just really weird stuff that feels like no women were present for a sense check. Someone calls a female character a \"Vagina dentata\" as an insult at one point, displaying a spectacular lack of understanding of the phrase.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad631f53-d784-4240-a41d-4c13ebdb3f9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad631f53-d784-4240-a41d-4c13ebdb3f9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab079bc9-f6a0-4920-98dc-8de896e71167", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b04b9513f2add0d741503f4c71b5db84c2330ce2153d2519746e23a9d2c763e"}, "3": {"node_id": "76f4d02f-0d7d-40b0-b901-5eb3a30bff6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5aa6335b0cd59592f18232d1e5ea4f7910fbd13c166d3091b03a1f2b8c275532"}}, "hash": "866bed580eb3a59a1f0a4412c4be1a642542b4231116ca5c98059a9fd8df421b", "text": "Unrelated, but there's also a full on stereotype voodoo priestess character, with the face paint and accent, for no clear reason.\u00a0It's also quite disappointing to discover that your choices and actions really have very little impact. The original pitch was that everything you did would have ramifications - the world would grow and change radically according to what you did in it. What actually happens boils down to unlocking regional facilities like water towers or electrical substations and choosing who gets them in return for upgrades. Give stuff to the Police, called Peacekeepers, and you'll add traps and weapons to the streets, while the ordinary survivors add parkour aids like ziplines and jump pads.From comparing notes with other players there only seems to be a handful of slightly different outcomes - there's where no 'wait you did what?!' moments, bar one exception. A few early minor side missions play out differently and give the impression of meaningful options, and some characters occasionally reappear to show they're alive or tell you how totally different things are now, but, for the most part, there's no big changes that will see people picking apart what they did differently. You can't really play off factions or make enemies, and sometimes characters just straight up tell you to do the other thing if you try pick an option that isn't allowed.\u00a0There's basically two main plot tracks and only a couple of junction points in the whole game where yes/no decisions switches between them.\u00a0The one opportunity you have to make a big world change is tied to one of these paths as well, meaning it can be locked in or blocked out potentially hours before it happens. Aside from this one big option, missions are often the same whichever track you're on, just framed differently, with a few surface variations. One major decision is decided by choices you make long before you know what's coming as well, which left me feeling cheated as it unfurled: helping a single person at a certain point will, later down the line, see you locked into committing full on war crimes and being instrumental in mass murder with no way of knowing at the time. When I found out I desperately waited for an option to say 'no' that never came. Not that it mattered, though, because when I moved to a new area, a convenient communication blackout meant the faction I'd just slaughtered a huge number of didn't know about it and we were all still friends.\u00a0The main story is fairly unfocused throughout this: you're looking for the sister you lost as a child, and the scientist who tortured you both. The only reason you're in the city, or aiding any of the people you meet, is because they can help with that. It sort of works as motivation but does little to meaningfully invest you in, or tie you to, the world emotionally. The two factions are fighting to survive, society is on the brink of collapse, and you're risking life and limb to get involved in what's tantamount to civil war purely because someone might know someone that heard something about the bad guy. Everyone is basically helping a stranger find another stranger. It's more justification than motivation. The ending feels very tacked on as well, again having very little connection to anything you've done. The epilogue even throws in a few 'Poochie died on the way to his home planet' style captions to tie up loose ends, before a weird conclusion doesn't so much put a bow on things, as wrestle all the plot threads to the floor and hogtie them. Almost all the narrative feels more like a fix than intention. \u00a0It's a good job, then, that everything just carries on after the credits like nothing happened, leaving you free to wander around and enjoy the world. I know I've hammered the story and choices, but this is still a game that's great to play moment to moment. It just doesn't hold up if you stop to think about why almost any of it is happening. Simply careening around getting into zombie fights, uncovering things, picking up missions and activities is endlessly entertaining and it's almost a relief after the story's done to not worry about justifying any of it. The world, and the things you can do in it, provide huge amounts of entertainment and there's plenty here I'm still going back to revisit. The undead fantasy is strong, even if the writing and characters don't always entice you to care too much about the living.\u00a0Reviewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher.\u00a0I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

And humanity is fighting back. Within strongholds scattered across The City, technological breakthroughs are born, and the tide of war is changing to favor the living. An electronic wristband keeps people from turning after a zombie bite, and even the most aggressive monster variants don\u2019t stand a chance against the latest weapon innovations. But all is not well beyond these walls. Darkness lies within, and humanity\u2019s most significant threat for survival is itself. Greed, lust, betrayal, and arcane politics could ultimately lead to its downfall.Dying Light 2 Stay Human blends the terrors of the dead with the strife of life to create one of the most entertaining RPGs I\u2019ve ever played. It is a triumph of storytelling, player choice, open-world design, cooperative play, character customization, and perhaps most importantly, dropkicking zombies off skyscrapers. It\u2019s everything a sequel should be, growing the core formula in significant ways to make high-flying, zombie-slaying sizzle again.During the 50-plus hours I invested in this fantastic game, I often thought about playing The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for the first time, feeling overwhelmed by its wealth of content and not knowing if I screwed something up with a hasty decision. Dying Light 2 is drawn from that same breath, blending a rich world of discovery with choices galore. It\u2019s an experience you can lose yourself in, and almost all of the content you unearth is significant to evolving both the story and your character.Our guide into this wasteland is Aiden Caldwell, a survivor haunted by ghosts of his past who re-enters society at a tipping point. Aiden is a likable lead who is defined mainly by his choices. He lords over the city like an apocalyptic judge, often determining who lives, who dies, and which factions gain wealth and power. Most of his choices carry weight and bring closure or new beginnings for many of the characters he meets along the way. I often had to stop to think about the benefits and ramifications of a decision. Techland sometimes forces your hand in these moments by putting a timer on the more pressing matters to heighten their impact. And it works.When Aiden heads out on a mission, the player is in for a real treat. Not only are the objectives well written, but they unfold dynamically and almost always push Aiden to bound across rooftops. Dying Light 2\u2019s parkour system is a work of art set within a beautiful, sprawling city that doubles as an architectural playground. Clear pathways are littered across the environments, allowing Aiden to keep momentum and reach almost any location by just running, jumping, and using some of the game\u2019s awesome gadgets. I won\u2019t go into what they are as discovering them is part of the fun, but they all enhance the locomotion and are a blast to use. All told, this is one of the most satisfying and nicely designed traversal systems in FPS gaming. It feels better than the original game, is much more forgiving in reading jump intent, and reaches new heights through The City's soaring verticality.Choice is even intertwined in a clever way for traversal. Depending on which factions you distribute wealth to, new interactive elements and other handy tools unlock in areas of the city. As I learned, sometimes Aiden's personal gains outweigh the needs of the people. These choices don't make you feel good, but they can make traversal and combat easier and should pay off in the long run.Aiden\u2019s missions offer plenty of variety, and sew puzzles and combat into most objectives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0d9a369-8ad9-4d06-bf47-881e1c462f4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0d9a369-8ad9-4d06-bf47-881e1c462f4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "76f4d02f-0d7d-40b0-b901-5eb3a30bff6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5aa6335b0cd59592f18232d1e5ea4f7910fbd13c166d3091b03a1f2b8c275532"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ef42d89-e312-4960-888c-faee866d3885", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5817b02ba92b0887d051150fb4ce1489988bc5a0fb04d313f80e3d5a50b81501"}}, "hash": "c544f19a2193afb4f7ad940a647789e78617adb84d898fa4feae2f59c5e96214", "text": "I was impressed by how varied, well-written, and dynamically composed the missions are. The critical path delivers the big set-piece moments, but the side material is vital to the overall narrative and is often lengthy. Nothing in this game feels tacked on \u2013 it\u2019s all worth investigating. And it\u2019s all made better through cooperative play, as you and three of your friends can team up or divide and conquer to claim territories, clear out dangerous dark hallows, and find valuable loot (like inhibitor boxes that raise your stamina and health). The dark hallows make it worth the risk of going out at night when the zombies are more aggressive.Combat is the one area that takes a bit of a backseat to the other great content. It\u2019s a huge part of the experience, and it's a heck of a lot of fun to eviscerate Biters, but the melee isn\u2019t as advanced as the other parts of the game, and it doesn\u2019t evolve much, either. Regardless, crafting blades that cough fire and electrocute zombies is satisfying, and that dropkick I mentioned is worth using as much as you can. Boss battles and swarm battles are made better through cooperative play as the difficulty (and hit points) scale up and create more dynamic encounters.One fight against a titan pushed my group of four players to unload everything they had \u2013 Molotov cocktails, arrows, and carefully timed sword combos \u2013 before it finally dropped. The rewards that came after were well worth the effort. Mastering parry timing against human foes \u2013 who are as abundant as zombies \u2013 is tricky but not something you have to rely on as more combat moves unlock.Dying Light 2 is an engaging journey of discovery and gaining power. Almost everything you do embraces those dynamics. In evolving beyond the first game's offerings, putting a stronger emphasis on the characters helps shape the world in meaningful ways. Some of Aiden\u2019s choices are difficult, especially those surrounding a character named Lawan \u2013 who is given a hell of a pulse by Rosario Dawson. I can\u2019t say enough great things where his and her stories go. I adored almost every second of this game and see myself often revisiting it, as Techland has announced at least five years of DLC is on the way. That\u2019s a wonderful promise to hear when starting a new game that has turned out this well.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer. All Rights Reserved.\nGameSpot, Techland's undead sequel improves upon the strongest element of its predecessor, but things like story and characters drag it down.By \n    Mark Delaney\n   on February 8, 2022 at 3:09PM PSTWhen developer Techland added the subtitle \"Stay Human\" to Dying Light 2, it seemed to signal the team's intentions to rediscover (and showcase) the humanity nestled at the core of the story. Since 2018, the team has made promises about the numerous narrative branches Dying Light 2 players would find in the game. Those branches are there, and they are indeed plentiful, but experiencing them felt equivalent to falling out of a tree and hitting my face on every branch on the way down. While Dying Light 2's most crucial element, first-person parkour, is certainly better than it's ever been in this massive sequel, much of the rest of the game fails to keep up.Dying Light 2 is set in the fictional Villedor, a new city in the story, and features a fresh, grizzled hero central to its conflict. As a \"pilgrim,\" an outsider perceived as dangerous to the few remaining safe zones in the world, Aiden Caldwell ventures into Villedor in search of his sister Mia, whom he last saw years ago when they were both kids. Through hazy flashbacks that aren't clear enough for even Aiden to rely on, his and Mia's story is poorly delivered early and often. It feels as though simply telling players that Aiden and Mia are siblings is meant to be enough for the player to care about their hopeful reunion, but Techland struggles to show why anyone should be invested in Mia beyond the familial connection. She becomes a living Macguffin, meant to justify Aiden's video gamey escapades as a side-questing superstar leaping across tall buildings in a single bound.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ef42d89-e312-4960-888c-faee866d3885": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ef42d89-e312-4960-888c-faee866d3885", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0d9a369-8ad9-4d06-bf47-881e1c462f4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c544f19a2193afb4f7ad940a647789e78617adb84d898fa4feae2f59c5e96214"}, "3": {"node_id": "f0bd10c1-7097-4fe2-9112-9c29b7fcb8d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4c6244a77a15b0b11a288c54f20b934fb32cce36e4f537cf84be5923f6091fa"}}, "hash": "5817b02ba92b0887d051150fb4ce1489988bc5a0fb04d313f80e3d5a50b81501", "text": "By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Dying Light 2 Stay Human Video ReviewSurrounding Aiden is a wide cast of characters who can sometimes be diverse and interesting, but ultimately share one thing in common: poor voice acting. While Aiden's actor, Jonah Scott, does well, and Rosario Dawson deserves some credit for her role as his part-time ally, Lewan, that's about it in terms of voice talent. Other characters try and fail to pull on heartstrings, in part because of the subpar acting, and the less important the quest is, the worse the acting tends to be too. Sometimes the only thing more awkward than how a character said a particular line is that they said it at all. The writing routinely misses the mark.It doesn't help that the game's tone shifts so frequently that players might experience emotional whiplash. When accepting a wildly silly or deadly serious character for who they are, it's a constant struggle to feel invested in what they're asking of Aiden because they so often come off as wooden and disjointed. It can be difficult to account for precisely how a conversation will be heard in a finished game with so many branching paths, and that can lead to line delivery issues, but Dying Light 2 seems to sidestep the years of progress made in RPGs to address this particular hurdle much to every character's detriment. There was no one I cared to spend time with other than Aiden himself, because he's nearly the only character who sounds like a real person.Dying Light 2's bad story manages to get even worse by its end, when a final act and frustrating final boss upend any possibility that there would be something to salvage by the game's 50th hour. This is a game that was billed as offering 500 hours of content, largely due to its number of quests and branching paths, but if my job didn't require it, I'd have skipped every cutscene and dialogue option after the first hour or so.Should you decide to play that way, you'll very likely enjoy your time in Villedor more than I did. That's because, for all of its story woes, the open world and how you explore it are genuinely fun. First-person platforming is a tricky feat, but Techland flexes its muscles and improves on something that was already very good. After a few upgrades, it becomes clear that Aiden is faster and more impressive than Kyle Crane ever was in the first game. Aiden is better equipped too, with sandbox staples like a grappling hook and glider to further enhance his travels.In some ways, this core strength makes Dying Light 2 work where so many other open-world games don't; rather than players focusing on the major beats\u2013the main quests and most exciting side missions\u2013and leaving a lot of the so-called filler untouched, here those peripheral activities represent the game's finest work. Parkour time trials or even just scaling some of the game's biggest skyscrapers is quality, repeatable fun. Tightrope-walking a mile above the city while the wind threatens to leave you splattered below provides an immersive guttural sense of dread. Meanwhile, exploring abandoned stores for valuables while the undead sleep hunched over like something out of a horror movie puts the emphasis on scares in a way I wish there was more of.This is aided by a skill tree that has very few undesirable perks. Each time I could acquire a new skill, I had to pause and really consider what I'd want\u2013need, really\u2013next for Aiden. These skills are broken into combat and parkour, so I farmed XP pretty reliably just by doing the things I wanted to do better anyway. Armor and gear perks add an additional role-playing wrinkle that had me feeling less like a hoarder, but rather, smarter for keeping different outfits as builds for the anti-hero.The combat doesn't shine as brightly as the parkour, but it's not the game's darkest blemish. When faced with hordes of infected, including many new special types such as Howlers that signal a mass of monsters, and Anomalies, grotesque mini-bosses waiting in arenas at night, the combat is at its best. Managing a crowd when different types of monsters are slow or fast, tank-like, or agile, makes for the good kind of stress this game was always meant to have.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0bd10c1-7097-4fe2-9112-9c29b7fcb8d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0bd10c1-7097-4fe2-9112-9c29b7fcb8d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ef42d89-e312-4960-888c-faee866d3885", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5817b02ba92b0887d051150fb4ce1489988bc5a0fb04d313f80e3d5a50b81501"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5fdd263-27d1-42da-8654-703927b8a640", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9a99dcab33999ce9967f4fd25221750f2a4e1a55d365b9bfd3d861c7bbb4e5b"}}, "hash": "f4c6244a77a15b0b11a288c54f20b934fb32cce36e4f537cf84be5923f6091fa", "text": "Even after 50 hours, it's difficult to control a crowd of zombies without working up a good sweat in the process.Combat with humans, most often the tropey Renegades who dress like Legion of Doom superfans, is less enjoyable because it regularly comes down to performing the same small moveset on every crowd of bad guys: dodge, slash, and slash. There's room for doing some cooler moves, like a vaulting ability that lets you catapult off one enemy onto another, but rarely is there incentive to be so stylish. I eventually ditched a lot of this fluff in favor of the dropkick that sends villains satisfyingly flailing off of rooftops. That one truly never gets old.Stealth mechanics are such an afterthought that it's hard to rationalize why they're involved at all. Infiltrating enemy bases and taking them out quietly is the sort of fun Far Cry has been driven by for a decade, but Dying Light's intent to mimic it fails because there are so few tall grass areas in the world, which is about the only way to hide from human enemies. Dashing across rooftops while the infected lurk in the streets at night has a more enjoyable feeling to it, but even then, going to street level even for a moment can prove frustrating because Howlers spot Aiden so quickly. This reimagining of the series' night cycle basically turns every touch of the sidewalk into a run for your life. I found myself wishing for the original game's vision cones at times. At least that way made a bit more sense from the player's point of view.No matter what you're doing\u2013be it chasing down a story lead, parkouring for the fun of it, or running for your life, the soundtrack masterfully reacts to every step in a way I've not seen done in games before. The dynamic music composed by industry titan Olivier Deriviere shifts from story to side mission to open-world exploration without missing a beat, even going so far as to let the air out of the soundtrack whenever you take a jump, helping to give you that rollercoaster-like sense of weightlessness. Strangely enough, the music ends up creating a much stronger sense of atmosphere and consequences within Dying Light 2 than its story.Despite all the time in the figurative oven, Dying Light 2 still feels a bit unpolished too. Bugs weren't at the forefront of my bad times with the game\u2013usually\u2013but I witnessed things like sandbox activities being broken, a windmill puzzle that refused to be climbed, and a particular river that, when I fell in, would often not let me climb back onto land. Most often seen was an issue with the game's geometry, where I'd get stuck on some objects for reasons I couldn't understand. Thankfully a bit of button-mashing usually fixed those hiccups, and bugs rarely affected any of the game's best bits: the first-person parkour.Playing co-op in Dying Light 2 does make the experience a bit more fun. Bringing friends to activities like military convoys, bandit camps, and GRE anomalies makes them all a lot more manageable, and with the exception of the prologue, you can play the entire game in co-op, right down to its lackluster final boss. I've seen my co-op sessions disconnect several times already, which is frustrating, but if there's any saving grace, it's that frequent auto-saves mean I'm not losing much but a few minutes to reboot the session each time.Though you can complete missions, side missions, and even earn achievements or trophies in co-op, every box is checked according to the host's instance of the world. I took weapons and XP back to my own save file, but my map was still disappointingly full of things I'd already done in co-op. This limitation ultimately leaves me feeling like co-op is a fun distraction--and best in the endgame--but not how I'd play the full experience.If all of this sounds rather inconsistent, it's meant to. Dying Light 2 is a perplexing game. Its story and characters are headache-inducing, and it appears to lack polish in many areas. But even a dozen hours after I rolled credits, I've found myself going back to the game to do another parkour challenge, rummage through another abandoned science lab, or just see if I can get from Point A to Point B without ever hitting the ground.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5fdd263-27d1-42da-8654-703927b8a640": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5fdd263-27d1-42da-8654-703927b8a640", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0bd10c1-7097-4fe2-9112-9c29b7fcb8d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4c6244a77a15b0b11a288c54f20b934fb32cce36e4f537cf84be5923f6091fa"}, "3": {"node_id": "8dcf4b86-7798-4740-a1cd-75e432bae570", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "52b2c2aeea4125124268969bcf6b8127b109aee8411ccfaa9a978769d52e23f2"}}, "hash": "e9a99dcab33999ce9967f4fd25221750f2a4e1a55d365b9bfd3d861c7bbb4e5b", "text": "It's rough around the edges and it asks players to invest a lot in its weakest element, but once you realize the story, like gravity, is only going to pull you down, you can begin to defy it and enjoy the things Dying Light 2 actually does well.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nKotaku, The idea of being excited about yet another zombie video game in this, the year of our lord two-thousand and twenty-two, might seem ridiculous to some. Even I, a die-hard fan of the undead, understand how tired people are of zombies. They really are everywhere, from Back 4 Blood to Project Zomboid. But Dying Light 2 isn\u2019t just another zombie game\u2013a category that takes many forms, but rarely makes the act of moving around in the world exhilarating. Here, I\u2019m reminded of games like Spider-Man and Crackdown, in which simply getting around the open world is as enjoyable as anything else they have to offer. And while it tries and fails to make its complicated branching narrative compelling, Dying Light 2 is still a game that I could see myself sinking 500 hours into, because the running, jumping, and undead-kicking is just so damn good and satisfying.Developed by Techland, Dying Light 2 is an open-world first-person action-platformer with RPG elements and a whole lotta zombies to kill. It\u2019s the follow-up to 2015\u2019s Dying Light, though you don\u2019t really need to have played that game to get what\u2019s going on in this sequel.In the first game, a horrible disease led to people dying and coming back as mutated, deadly zombies. In the years since then, that disease has spread to most of the world, and now communities are isolated and dependent on pilgrims\u2013people who run from place to place through the harsh, zombie-filled world, delivering messages and supplies. You play as Aiden, one of these pilgrims, who has a strange past involving experiments and the undead. As a kid, Aiden and his sister were unwilling test subjects for horrible experiments. Aiden eventually escaped, but his sister Mia didn\u2019t. Now, Aiden finds himself in the last large city on Earth, Villedor, on the hunt for Mia and the man responsible for the terrible tests.This main narrative thread works fine as a way to propel Aiden through all the nonsense and violence found in Villedor, but it never really evolves into anything meaningful, mainly because the game spins its wheels for so long before it actually starts to reveal anything about Mia\u2019s fate, or that of anyone else involved. By the end, I wasn\u2019t even sure what the main villain wanted, which does not make for a very involving conflict or satisfying resolution. I won\u2019t spoil anything here, but if you prefer games with well-written and cohesive narratives, Dying Light 2 ain\u2019t that.So, what is Dying Light 2? Well, it\u2019s a giant, beautiful sandbox filled with zombies that you get to explore using some of the best traversal gameplay I\u2019ve experienced. As a pilgrim, Aiden is very good at running, jumping, sliding, and climbing. And nearly every inch of the game\u2019s large open world is covered in things to grab, climb, swing off of, and land on. The first game had similar parkour controls and level design, but Dying Light 2 feels as if Techland realized how the first game\u2019s movement made it stand out from so many other zombie games, and focused on building it up more. The end result is one of the best parkour systems I\u2019ve ever seen in a game.When I encountered barriers in Dying Light 2, I would get excited, enjoying the process of scanning nearby walls and buildings for ways to get up and over the obstacle in my path. A tall wall with no obvious way to surmount it? No problem. I just wall run a bit, leap to and grab a nearby light post, spin off of that, land on a balcony of a shorter building across the street, then sprint and leap across the road back toward the top of that first tall wall, overcoming it and feeling like a champion in the process. All of this takes just a few seconds, is silky smooth and feels amazing.And you get to repeat this process hundreds of times, often facing new obstacles and having to come up with parkour solutions on the fly. Add in some hungry zombies and these moments quickly become not just satisfying environmental puzzles, but tense moments of survival. Plus, unlike the climbing in so many other games that make it difficult or impossible for you to fall or fail, here you can and will screw up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8dcf4b86-7798-4740-a1cd-75e432bae570": {"__data__": {"id_": "8dcf4b86-7798-4740-a1cd-75e432bae570", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5fdd263-27d1-42da-8654-703927b8a640", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9a99dcab33999ce9967f4fd25221750f2a4e1a55d365b9bfd3d861c7bbb4e5b"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa858af5-3cdf-45f4-a32b-593e68aec459", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "36c291ee5cd6b93aae531e0d0d225d7697193f9e06bf3610ca3c610e6723650a"}}, "hash": "52b2c2aeea4125124268969bcf6b8127b109aee8411ccfaa9a978769d52e23f2", "text": "The fact that missing a landing or not thinking ahead enough could lead to danger or death makes the parkour all the more tense and thrilling.As you level up and unlock more parkour moves (as well as naturally get better with the controls over time), you quickly build up a large library of techniques that can be combined into long chains that elegantly flow together. I rarely fast-traveled in Dying Light 2 because, like Spider-Man on PS4, moving around the city is way too much fun to just warp to the next quest.Eventually, Dying Light 2 does give you access to a paraglider and grappling hook, but these don\u2019t detract from the fun of parkouring (is that a word?) around the city. Instead, they elevate that part of the game. Now you can paraglide up to the very top of skyscrapers in a few seconds, then use your parkour skills and grappling hook to swing and jump around inside and outside the structure searching for collectibles. I say this with no exaggeration: Moving around this world is some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in a game in some time.Of course, it\u2019s not all running and jumping in Dying Light 2. There are also zombies and humans to kill. But while Dying Light 2 is presented in a first-person perspective, this isn\u2019t an FPS. As far as I can tell after nearly 45 hours of playtime, there appear to be no guns in Dying Light 2. There are some bows and crossbows, but firearms seem nowhere to be found. (This is explained in some of the game\u2019s lore, if you care about that kind of thing.) This isn\u2019t surprising considering how rare guns were in the first game and how bad they felt to use once you got them. Leaving them out of the equation was the right call, and Techland has instead focused combat around close-quarters melee action.\u201cParkour! Parkour! Parkour!\u201dZombie infested first-person open-world parkour/action RPG Great movement controls, satisfying combat, gorgeous visuals, meaningful day/night cycleCrafting system is a chore, main quest is a dud, some filler content, complex controlsTechlandPS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC (Played)February 4, 2022Played about 45 hours alone. Completed the main questline, maxed out character skills, crafted dozens of weapons, and finished a large chunk of the game\u2019s side content and quests.If you\u2019ve ever played a first-person action game with melee combat, you\u2019ll get the basics right away. Swinging, blocking, and dodging are your fundamentals, each mapped to a different button. But as you unlock better skills and find new weapons, the combat evolves into something much better than Skyrim with zombies.Combat in Dying Light 2 feels both heavy and responsive. You can quickly swing away with a small pipe or use bigger weapons, like two-handed hammers, to slowly do damage in larger, heftier swings. But all of the combat feels tight. There isn\u2019t that sense of floatiness that so many other first-person games with melee combat suffer from. This is thanks to how you subtly and automatically lock on to enemies as you attack them, while never being directly connected to any one specific bad guy or zombie during a fight. It leads to combat scenarios in which you\u2019re diving around enemies, getting in a few good whacks, and then hopping over someone nearby to escape a follow-up attack. A ballet of blood, if you will. Some might find the controls for all of this too complex, but I found that with a few hours of practice, I was a smooth murder machine.Contributing to the excitement of combat is your ability to modify weapons, adding extra blades to deal more damage, or electric batteries to shock and stun foes during critical hits. Unfortunately, the crafting and blueprint system in Dying Light 2 is a grind, requiring far too many resources to fully upgrade any of your weapons. Still, even a barely upgraded electric ax covered in flames is deadly and fun to use.Like the original game, Dying Light 2 features a day/night cycle. And also like the last game, Dying Light 2 depicts night as a more dangerous time to go out. However, in the original, the threat of night was largely empty because you had plenty of resources and could easily defeat the tougher enemies that spawned at night. In the sequel, Techland better succeeds at making night feel harrowing. The streets become covered with zombies, and that includes all the nasty special infected variants that have become mandatory in any modern zombie game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa858af5-3cdf-45f4-a32b-593e68aec459": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa858af5-3cdf-45f4-a32b-593e68aec459", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dcf4b86-7798-4740-a1cd-75e432bae570", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "52b2c2aeea4125124268969bcf6b8127b109aee8411ccfaa9a978769d52e23f2"}, "3": {"node_id": "2ff9a369-610f-4084-918b-2ccc58326026", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb1f46429eee35b54b2c38d0d15c45b716032a9f0e07f3b2ac24cd9dce9ebd90"}}, "hash": "36c291ee5cd6b93aae531e0d0d225d7697193f9e06bf3610ca3c610e6723650a", "text": "Yes, there is a zombie in Dying Light 2 that spits, another one that blows up, and a huge, hulking one that moves slowly but packs a real punch if it catches you. But at night, there are so many zombies around that alerting just one of them leads to a frantic situation where fast-moving zombies, who co-exist alongside the more traditional walkers in this universe, relentlessly chase you until you die or find a safe place to hide.Of course, there are rewards for those who venture out into the night, including better loot, fewer zombies in buildings, and the ability to earn XP at a faster rate. Eventually, by around the 30-hour mark or so, I felt powerful enough to handle most of what the night threw at me, but before that, it was a scary experience. Even after I grew stronger and had better weapons, I still found myself being more cautious at night, with the contrast between night and day almost making it feel like I was playing two different, but equally fun open-world zombie games.In the lead-up to Dying Light 2\u2019s release, Techland talked a lot about how the game\u2019s story and its world would react to your decisions. But based on the fact that this review is nearing the end and I still haven\u2019t talked much about any of that, you can probably guess that this isn\u2019t really the case. While there are big decisions to make, like who gets the water supply or control of electricity in a certain area, the ramifications of these choices are small. Sure, I screwed over the quasi-military Peacekeepers faction multiple times, outright lying to them a few times even, and worse. But they still let me hang out with them. I could still do quests for them and freely visit their faction bases and trade with them. The only major thing that seemed to change based on my decisions was whether the city was filled with traps or parkour tools. That and which minor, mostly mundane fetch quests were available to me. It\u2019s a shame, because when I first played the game in a preview event last year, I was excited by the idea of a large open world reacting to my choices. Unfortunately, the end result is barely worth mentioning alongside other features.Instead, the best character and story moments happen outside of the main narrative and the big decisions you make. Dying Light 2 has some great side quests. One standout involves a man trying to set up a dating service for survivors using cards and bulletin boards. Another had me helping someone create a perfume that reminded them of the old world. (It turned out to be New Car Smell, funnily enough.) Some of these small quests even feature their own choices, like having to decide whether to help someone escape the city, at the cost of their loved one losing them forever. While none of these choices have larger consequences on how the story plays out, they stuck with me, unlike the bigger, more heavily promoted choices Techland wanted me to care about.Dying Light 2 doesn\u2019t tell a great or original zombie story, and it features a lot of big choices that mostly amount to nothing. But that\u2019s fine, because where Dying Light 2 succeeds is in the smaller moments between the big ones. A fight against a horde of undead that you hadn\u2019t planned on and might not survive. Escaping a tough enemy using all the parkour moves at your disposal. Barely surviving a nighttime excursion gone wrong and breaking your last good sword in the process. Or just swinging around, looking for the next place to explore but getting too distracted by how much fun it is to move around this place that you just\u2026don\u2019t stop.Maybe the world doesn\u2019t need another zombie game in 2022, but I\u2019m happy we got one, and I\u2019m happy it\u2019s the wickedly fun sandbox of Dying Light 2.\u00a0\nDestructoid, darkHold out your hands in front of you like Giorgio A.

It\u2019s simply a bit all over the place, trying to balance both the personal plight of our hero Aiden, and the lore of the world (chiefly the city of Villedor): it gets about halfway there on both. This story is set two decades after the original, taking place in the 2030s, and things are a bit different now in terms of zombie world tech.It\u2019s all serviceable. While I would have preferred another hero entirely and more detail on some specific elements of the lore, this is far from a cringe-worthy zombie tale, which is so easy to ease into these days. Characters are generally lively with their performances, especially in the more intimate moments of the story.That aforementioned familiarity comes into play in several respects. Dying Light 2 has a detective vision mechanic. There\u2019s crafting and lockpicking. And radio towers (windmills). There\u2019s also crafting and gathering, and even the materials are going to elicit memories of trouncing around Techland\u2019s own open-world romps. But once you actually play it, a lot of what the game is trying to do comes together.The parkour system really is the highlight of Dying Light 2, and carried the game across the finish line: I can\u2019t stress that enough. If the narrative is on a downbeat, a bug pops up, or a mission is too generic, my blank stare is replaced with a smile right after doing a bit of platforming. The way everything flows \u2014 and how the parkour upgrades slot into one another \u2014 is a treat. Successfully running and chaining together spots feels like the best moments of a Tony Hawk game, especially when you\u2019re creating \u201clines\u201d in the moment as you\u2019re moving.It\u2019s all facilitated through leveling up, which follows the \u201cyou gain experience when you actually do something\u201d design philosophy. Big fan! Having two trees branching off of combat and parkour keeps things wonderfully simple, which are communicated with on-screen \u201cyou got [this much XP]\u201d prompts. Both work in tandem with one another and open up combo actions, which are some of the strongest parts of the game.The ability to riposte a melee attack, then jump on someone\u2019s head, then do a 360-degree windmill turn off of a roof and grab an open window ledge is silly, in a real good way. Movement gets cleaner and crazier the more you play too, including wall-running shenanigans. We need more games that riff on Mirror\u2019s Edge, and I\u2019ll take it where I can get it. The gamification of these skills works to its benefit, especially when they come out naturally during some intense chases; because it\u2019s easy for Dying Light 2 to take itself way too seriously.Picturesque areas, set to the backdrop of trees and mountains, are stunning on a current-generation machine. Performance was not an issue for me on PS5, and as clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I stopped to admire the scenery several times in\u00a0Dying Light 2 \u2014 especially in the opening hour before you get to the city. The day and night cycle, which impacts how zombies and the player character interact, is smart, and done better than many other games that waste it.For the sake of transparency, there was one game-breaking issue with a quest that was patched during the review period (that I did not encounter), and one very unclear questline that did impact me (a main story quest that asks you to simply visit a settlement and chat with the inhabitants, but it didn\u2019t pop for me until I finished multiple seemingly optional sidequests). I also got stuck in a wall several times and had to load an autosave. Part of the issue is that there seems to be only one autosave in total: so if you encounter a glitch, you can\u2019t rewind to a previous state on console by default.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a700a2f7-2f73-492c-9f38-e0d86af9a513": {"__data__": {"id_": "a700a2f7-2f73-492c-9f38-e0d86af9a513", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ff9a369-610f-4084-918b-2ccc58326026", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bb1f46429eee35b54b2c38d0d15c45b716032a9f0e07f3b2ac24cd9dce9ebd90"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e91e0bd-fae5-42a8-a398-aa09c7d13162", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3bc880a83541ef2714e300c67b24b4ad59a1ed1b330c798db4a4bbd49c397920"}}, "hash": "4c7d7d208baf32d5dc9d10430c58de93962f02c6c5ccd933d50c4c874abd2d3e", "text": "I wouldn\u2019t call Dying Light 2 \u201cmessy\u201d or \u201cunpolished\u201d by any means, but it has your bog-standard open-world baggage.Dying Light 2 is safe in some respects, and bold in others; like its propensity to lean into some arcadey notions. The sandbox is the true heart of Dying Light 2. Not the characters, or the story, but the mere act of running around like an idiot, whether you\u2019re doing errands or not. Whether it keeps you busy for \u201c500 hours\u201d or 20, open-world fanatics will probably find a lot to love here.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.

Looking past the pre-launch drama to the game itself, does this follow-up to 2015\u2019s parkour-fuelled zombie survival title do enough to push the series forward in terms of story and gameplay, while also leveraging the power of the new-gen systems? Not quite.Dying Light 2\u2019s narrative is a marked improvement over the original, with a more interesting protagonist leading the fight in a world that is almost totally taken over by the infected. It\u2019s a predictable plot, but there are enough curious questions that need answers to push players forward. Main man Aiden Caldwell is played well by voice actor Jonah Scott and he\u2019s joined by a few standout allies, with Rosario Dawson\u2019s Lawan being the main highlight.Beyond the primary cast, however, other characters are either totally forgettable or memorable only for their obnoxious qualities. Thankfully, the devs at Techland have implemented a \u201cSkip Dialogue\u201d button that I ended up using for all but the main missions.In Dying Light 2, players can choose to side with a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d faction. I started out by siding with the goodies, but quickly became bored at how the story was developing, and so ended up on the dark side. Honestly, the \u201cmelee first, ask questions never\u201d is a much more enjoyable way to play, though many characters will hate you for it. Fortunately, they\u2019re so unimpactful that I\u2019ve already forgotten their names, so it hardly matters.Dying Light 2 tackles many heavy topics, but the poor writing ruins any chance of emotional impact. Some seriously messed up stuff happens, but it\u2019s tough to care about it with dialogue and characters this bland.The power of the PS5 results in Dying Light 2\u2019s wonderfully fluid gameplay. Though there\u2019s the option to prioritize resolution over frame rate, I can\u2019t see why anyone would opt for that.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e91e0bd-fae5-42a8-a398-aa09c7d13162": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e91e0bd-fae5-42a8-a398-aa09c7d13162", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "a700a2f7-2f73-492c-9f38-e0d86af9a513", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c7d7d208baf32d5dc9d10430c58de93962f02c6c5ccd933d50c4c874abd2d3e"}, "3": {"node_id": "3af70024-a38a-4b17-80aa-cc33d59be075", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce161e582db866696baa8a5b6f0a02582a8b65dd9ec9c50c8f019f4c91717388"}}, "hash": "3bc880a83541ef2714e300c67b24b4ad59a1ed1b330c798db4a4bbd49c397920", "text": "60 FPS makes everything just so much smoother and also makes inputs feel more responsive.My only issues with performance are the forced motion blur and occasionally blurry landscapes, the latter of which becomes an issue as you climb higher. Other than that, Dying Light 2 looks pretty damn good, despite the push for 60 FPS.Unfortunately, a number of bugs have plagued my review experience. From falling through the ground to dialogue being automatically skipped, it\u2019s been a bit of a nightmare. The good news is that the devs have been rolling out patches throughout the review period, so it seems like they are on the ball. At the time of publishing this review, however, I\u2019m still skeptical of a totally polished game being ready for launch.As with the first game, Dying Light 2 shines brightest when it comes to traversing the environment and fighting zombies. Luckily, this is exactly what players are encouraged to do for the majority of the experience.The fun, brutal combat has been made even better. Firearms that made encounters a simple matter of peppering a trigger are now almost totally removed. Instead, there\u2019s a bolstered melee arsenal and a vast number of modifiers that add elemental damage, buff stats, and more.As for traversal, parkour is back again and Aiden has even more tricks up his sleeves than previous protagonist Kyle Crane. However, these do have to be unlocked over time, which is a shame to see. When I first started the game, I was confused at why I couldn\u2019t slide, before realizing I\u2019d have to work to unlock that basic maneuver. Initial skills are too limited and I don\u2019t think it would have been overwhelming to give players a little more to play with. It sucks when games hold the good stuff for 10+ hours in.When players aren\u2019t going hand-to-hand with a variety of undead and soon-to-be-dead enemies, or running from rooftop to rooftop before deploying the new glider to sail to the next objective, they are looting.Dying Light 2 has a lot of loot, from crafting materials to temporary buffs. Lucky players will find a high-level weapon with a ton of mod potential and this is where the true dopamine hit lies. Finding a nasty new melee weapon and trying it out on zombies is the key gameplay loop that I just couldn\u2019t stop chasing. However, the sheer number of zombies that are lootable but then end up \u201cEmpty\u201d is maddening. Why make bodies lootable if they have no loot?!On a more positive note, the nighttime expeditions also make a return, as do the buffed rewards given to those braving the night and its unique, highly lethal Volatile monsters. This time around, however, playing during the night is now not as optional. There are nighttime missions that players will need to get through if they hope to get some unique rewards and progress side-mission content. I personally love this, as nighttime turns everything up to 11, with combat made much more intense and chase sequences being outright terrifying. I did everything I could at night, as that extra layer helped rescue the otherwise uninspired mission design.Played alone, the nighttime events may be too much for some. Thankfully, co-op once again makes a return. Up to four players can join a game and fight together. This is great to see, as my fondest memories of the original game took place in co-op. However, Dying Light 2\u2019s mission structure is clearly built around a solo player, so it can make it awkward to suddenly have three more people shoved into the experience.I feel like Techland could have focused on the co-op implementation a little more, to build upon what made the first game so much fun with friends (and strangers). Hopefully we\u2019ll see the multiplayer experience expanded upon in post-launch content, which the devs have been good for in the past.While Dying Light 2 does a lot right with its gameplay and new-gen presentation, it\u2019s still a far cry from zombie gaming greatness. The weak story, uninspired mission design, limitations on initial player skills, and bugs let it down in a big way. Sure, a lot of this will be easy to ignore when fighting the undead as a four-man squad, but \u201cit\u2019s fun with friends\u201d is an excuse that can only get you so far.Dying Light 2 was reviewed on PS5 with code provided by the publisher.7Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

But does the sequel provide a better experience than the original?Back in 2015, the world was treated to Dying Light, a game that was critiqued heavily by the industry but found a cult following with fans of zombie titles. Now, almost a decade later, Techland has a sequel for players to sink their teeth into: Dying Light 2 Stay Human. This entry in the franchise looks to dive back into the infected-filled world, albeit with a different protagonist and in a different location.A lot of what made the original game so popular returns, from the parkour, freerunning and melee-based combat to the huge open world full of quests, crafting, and exploration. Unfortunately, though Dying Light 2 Stay Human reaches out to grasp at greatness, it too often stumbles, the opportunity slipping through its fingers.The story of Dying Light 2 takes place 15 years after the events of the first game and follows Aiden as he tries to find his long-lost sister. Aiden isn\u2019t just your every-day survivor either, he\u2019s a Pilgrim, a sort of social outcast who moves between settlements to deliver information and other important things. The start of the game finds him in a walled-off city called Villedor, where two factions wrestle for control, as the infected and marauders bite at their heels and bash at their doors.As far as the narrative goes, there\u2019s plenty of intrigue to propel the story along, as you work to not only find your sister but uncover the mystery of why Aiden and her were being experimented on as children. Beyond this overarching plotline, the feud between the scrappy Survivors and the militia-like Peacekeepers works to enrich the world of Dying Light 2.Part of the appeal of the game\u2019s story is player agency whereby, at certain moments in the plot, the decision you make will affect the path you take. Siding with the Survivors or the Peacekeepers each has its own benefit and effect on the general course of the campaign.Despite the narrative offering some interesting story beats, there are elements that are predictable, which can lead to moments of frustration where the player has to watch Aiden expertly fail to put 2-and-2 together.There was another thorn in my side when it comes to the narrative in Dying Light 2, and it has less to do with the plot and more to do with the construction. Because this is an open world game, quests can often take players to far-flung corners of the map. This is a great way to get players to explore and find new encounters, but it made many of the main missions \u2013 and side quests \u2013 feel more like fetch quests than something that actually propels the narrative along.When Dying Light 2 Stay Human finally eases up on the fetch quests and instead lets you loose in one of its epic set piece moments, it starts to feel quite good. Scaling a huge windmill, sprinting away from infected in a darkened subway, and ascending the biggest building in the city made me forget for just a moment that I\u2019m basically this city\u2019s errand boy with another handful of delivery missions ahead of me.The problem of almost reaching greatness can be best summarized with the aforementioned ascension of the game\u2019s biggest building. After being given a parachute, taught how to use it, and told to climb the largest building, I excitedly began the task thinking I would get the chance to dive off the top and glide down. Just as I was getting ready for my moment, Dying Light 2 took it away from me, and instead made me watch a cutscene of Aiden gliding down to the second tallest building, where I promptly regained control.Where Dying Light 2 Stay Human starts to shine is with its gameplay. The game is at its best when you\u2019re bounding across rooftops, stringing together a variety of parkour moves like wallrunning and vaulting over objects, and even paragliding between buildings as you use air vents to send you higher.Beyond this, after spending a few points to unlock new moves, the combat starts to feel more robust than just mashing the melee button until everything dies. You\u2019ll be able to use enemies as objects to jump over and even start doing some mid-air moves to handle the foes. In saying this, the block and parry system is sluggish and it can often feel more efficient to just mash the attack button until you whittle a foe\u2019s health down.When these elements do gel together is when Dying Light 2 feels good, but too often the fluidity of movement and combat slams into a wall.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a40e348-0c8a-4b2a-a825-14db4078f66a": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a40e348-0c8a-4b2a-a825-14db4078f66a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "3af70024-a38a-4b17-80aa-cc33d59be075", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce161e582db866696baa8a5b6f0a02582a8b65dd9ec9c50c8f019f4c91717388"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d5bb984-4d85-44a2-b741-bf75faaeeb16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "adfc899ce2827d76b6271ead6caa81d30d496acf030887544b22aef73f77dd5f"}}, "hash": "7087b18c1b7ee0434a84b99a3fdfbc78dc5f067c8f618a1a53dfcdc131e8e101", "text": "It felt like a coin toss as to whether Aiden would move through the environment in a predictable manner or come to a complete stop as a doorframe or the lip of a ledge slightly obstructed his pathing.Mechanics like parkour elements and combat maneuvers should become second nature, fading into the background as muscle memory kicks in. However, I was constantly wrestling with the controls, taking me out of the moment and leading to quite a lot of frustration.In the times where the movement worked well, exploring the city of Villedor was a treat. The level design on offer here is rather impressive. There are an almost overwhelming number of avenues available to the player as they traverse the city. Ziplines connect distant rooftops, launch pads and vents propel Aiden into the air, while walls, railings, ledges and scaffolding grant access to an intricately layered city.But again, the sense of speed and freedom comes to a shuddering stop whenever the player needs to start searching for materials for upgrading, adding mods to weapons, or for trading. Containers must be opened by holding a button, while each individual item must be looked at and picked up, and both of these have their own animation of Aiden reaching out to interact with the item. It\u2019s slow going and feels at odds with the game\u2019s speed.Where this slow and methodical approach does work is in Dying Light 2\u2019s stealth moments. Players are encouraged to get out and explore the city at night, despite the infected being more numerous and stronger. Nighttime means being able to access special buildings that hold valuable resources, and also means using stealth to slink by sleeping infected.To add to the tension of these moments in the darkness is Aiden\u2019s own infection. He can only be in the dark so long before he turns into one of the infected. This means players will need to manage this ever-ticking clock, consuming mushrooms to increase the time they can linger in the dark or stepping into UV light to stave off the effects of the infection. It\u2019s an element that felt like more of a nuisance to deal with than an interesting constraint, and that\u2019s coming from someone who actively enjoyed Dead Rising\u2019s ticking clock. Plus, Aiden can eventually use a UV flashlight, which he is unable to use on himself when in the dark.On the point of UV light keeping the infection at bay, there are also windmills to climb and claim that turn into little safe zones. At night, these are lit up with UV lamps, preventing the infected from chasing you. The windmills are one of the many side activities that fill the city of Villedor. There are also Dark Hollows and Forbidden Stores that yield high level rewards but can only be explored at night along with Evacuation Convoys, Military Airdrops and a ton of quests to aid the citizens of the city.The other major facet in Dying Light 2\u2019s design is its crafting systems. Weapons can have attachments added to them, increasing their killing potential and even extending their life just a bit longer. However, like the previous titles in Techland\u2019s catalogue, these weapons will inevitably break, forcing you to keep looking for the next pointy stick to use against your enemies.As for the upgrades and blueprints, these must be found or purchased and then crafted using the various items you\u2019ll scavenge throughout the city. Some also require trophies from special infected or military-grade electronics from side quests and hard-to-reach locations.Visually, Dying Light 2 is a gorgeous game to look at. The rooftops are lush and overgrown with green vegetation and flowers while the buildings and people take on an almost medieval flourish, with striking colors and clothing designs.Contrasting this are the streets of Villedor. Much like the lower levels of some futuristic dystopian city, the alleyways and roads are clogged with grime and mucky colors. If the infected weren\u2019t reason enough, the soiled environment is sure to encourage you back to the rooftops. It\u2019s also a neat visual storytelling moment, showcasing that humanity is surviving, albeit on the fringe of the world.The dizzying highs and breath-holding intense stealth moments are punctuated by a soundtrack that is an immediate classic. There were pieces that reminded me of the sombre moments from 28 Days Later and even electrical tunes that got the adrenaline pumping as I hacked and slashed through a building full of marauders.While the gameplay has a lot of rough edges, these are easier to ignore thanks to the inclusion of co-op. During my time with the game, I was lucky enough to get into a co-op session with the Techland developers in Poland, as well as a lovely bloke from Canada.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d5bb984-4d85-44a2-b741-bf75faaeeb16": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d5bb984-4d85-44a2-b741-bf75faaeeb16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a40e348-0c8a-4b2a-a825-14db4078f66a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7087b18c1b7ee0434a84b99a3fdfbc78dc5f067c8f618a1a53dfcdc131e8e101"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a0ed33e-70b5-461a-a0d8-821e62b737dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8430fdb5ace39eb1193b45ec13e62a151102860ae3788370c00565eced66bfa7"}}, "hash": "adfc899ce2827d76b6271ead6caa81d30d496acf030887544b22aef73f77dd5f", "text": "The four of us adventured through the city, took down infected, sneaked through enemy-filled buildings, and generally enjoyed the freedom Dying Light 2 provides its players. We even engaged in some friendly competition with the game\u2019s challenges: a checkpoint time trial and one that had us using an automatic crossbow to defeat as many enemies as possible within the time limit.One massive grievance I have with Dying Light 2 is the lack of controller customization options. Though players have gotten somewhat used to it with the original Dying Light and the likes of Mirror\u2019s Edge, having jump tied to the right bumper and no means of changing this on my controller is frustrating.Another critical mechanic in the game is Aiden\u2019s Survivor Sense, which pulses out and highlights items within a few feet around him. When using a controller, this is activated by holding the right thumbstick. This is dreadfully cumbersome and made worse by the fact it has a hidden cooldown.The game is also full of jarring sequence breaks when talking with characters. Sometimes they\u2019ll end a conversation, walk out of shot, and when you regain control of Aiden and turn to see where they went, they\u2019ve disappeared. At one particularly egregious point, Aiden was talking with a character on a rooftop, turned, and spoke to another. He asked where the first person went and this new character pointed to a rooftop 100 feet away. Moments like these are just strange and ultimately break the immersion.There\u2019s a lot going on in Dying Light 2 Stay Human. The story that\u2019s presented is moreish, despite having predictable beats and clich\u00e9s. Its movement is sleek and fast when it\u2019s working but often stumbles over itself. The combat has glimpses of greatness but can wind up feeling a bit average. Overall, each element taken by itself has potential but when mixed together dilutes what could be a rich experience. Though there are moments of joy to be found, they\u2019re punctuated by fetch quests and odd collision detection. Fans of the original will no doubt find fun in a return to the world, but for everyone else, you might want to wait a bit longer before you take a bite.This review is based on a Steam code provided by the publisher.

The problem is if they would of made the sites/journalist wait for the day 1 patch the majority would of said they are doing some sort of funny business.\r My HOT take, they 100% should of delayed the launch by a week and gave all the reviewers access to the game only when the day 1 patch was completed.\r It's a shame companies rush games and potentially cause issues for no reason?? I guess the bottom line is that Elden Ring comes out on the 24th(and some others) so they want to push the game out as soon as possible. Also I guess the fact is the majority don't buy games off reviews anyways so again it doesn't really matter.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe should have waited for the day 1 patch?

People are dumb. The game is getting 75%+ on aggregate. Clearly it's not a bad game. Sadly scores would probably be in the 80s if Techland had not put it out before that patch. I think it's like valcan said, February has some major games coming and they clearly tried to beat Horizon and Elden Ring out the door. Luckily I bought those too lol. The only part of your review I find questionable is meh combat when every other review I've read says meh story, good to great combat. Not sure what's going on there. Anyway you don't have to justify a 7/10.  That's a good review. It's weird that people think that is a shitty review these days.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI suppose that's kind of the problem. A 7/10 isn't inherently bad, in fact (depending on your perception of grading which is based on where you grew up), a 7 is good! \r I personally find the melee-based combat to be a chore, and although there are a bunch of different moves to liven up the fighting, you're really only going to be dealing reasonable damage when you're smashing a zombie or human with a scarp object. The combat just doesn't resonate with me, but I can see how people like it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDid you get all the skills or just do story only? I imagine the more skills you have the more open ended the combat becomes, at least that's how the first worked. It was very slow starting in that game too. I suppose you have to rush to get review out. The first game was divisive too. I wish more people stuck with it because it was buggy on release too and I think a bunch of people dropped it but the dev still supporting it 6 years after release with free content. It's a sandbox rpg with zombies and parkour. Mostly melee oriented though but the first did have viable gunplay late game. Maybe this one does too. I know I will love it and I wish more people gave it a chance.

Because of this, you wind up wailing on foes with your weapons. Yes, I could string together a bunch of cool-looking moves, but after fighting the 30th human, you kind of just want to kill 'em and keep going.\r You're correct in that it's slow at the beginning. What really threw me was that Aiden is supposed to be this seasoned traveller and fighting but he only just starts learning this fighting moves when he reaches the city? There's just a disconnect between a bunch of the elements.\r But I've said to a few people, if you liked the first one and were looking forward to Dying Light 2, I doubt that these problems will negatively impact your opinion and experience, especially if you play with friends.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnticipation diminished.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHey!

Also I may be misremembering but I thought the first Dying Light had a lot more body degradation with bits and chunks coming off, while in 2 it seems like only limbs come off (mostly heads, though) or armor pieces.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShack review is first one I've seen bag on combat.

He needs to prove his worth as a craftsman\u2019s apprentice and has settled on a foolproof plan: using electrical fencing to stimulate the neighborhood\u2019s goats into producing more milk. A few misadventures and one fatally overstimulated goat later, you hold in your hand the resulting creation: something messy, but still close to brilliant.\r\nDying Light 2 is much the same. Techland improved on the original Dying Light in almost every way, with a more thoughtful scenario that distinguishes it as more than just a parkour twist on the zombie genre. It also fries some of its goats along the way, with unclear vision and a reluctance to let its unique traits shine.\r\nKyle Crane saved the city of Harran in Dying Light, and you quickly learn that amounts to nothing. The Global Relief Effort (GRE) \u2013 Dying Light\u2019s callous group of researchers ostensibly trying to find a cure for the zombie infection \u2013 succumbed to the temptation of power and plunged the world into another outbreak. The fortunate cities, such as Villedor, suffered chemical bombings and a descent into anarchy, as first one governing body then another disbanded and left everyone else scrambling to survive.\r\nThe GRE\u2019s downfall is a well-worn zombie trope, but it gives Dying Light 2 a greater sense of substance, at least. While the original game suffered from a paper thin story, it\u2019s evident Techland put more thought into creating an interesting world with its own rich backstory for the sequel. The primary focus is Villedor itself, though; a gigantic city that\u2019s both prison and home to tribes of infected humans trapped behind its walls, vying for control over land and resources.\r\nInto all this leaps Aiden, Dying Light 2\u2019s hero and Techland\u2019s answer to complaints against Kyle Crane\u2019s static personality. Aiden has his own mission connected to horrendous experiments he and other children were subjected to by the GRE, but gets pulled into Villedor\u2019s struggles during his journey. The balancing act is a bit messy, as Aiden\u2019s broader goal often gets lost in the moment-to-moment drama in the city. However, his characterisation and Jonah Scott\u2019s excellent vocal performance make that easy to overlook. Despite some strong work on the character to begin with, one of Dying Light 2\u2019s biggest sins is Aiden himself. We see through Aiden\u2019s eyes, yet we never have a chance to understand who he is. To the story\u2019s \u2013 and Scott\u2019s \u2013 credit, you as a player still feel a connection with Aiden despite never really getting to know him properly. I\u2019d like to have seen Techland go deeper with its new protagonist, and perhaps develop him as much as it developed Villedor itself. \r\nThe same goes for the broader story and characters \u2013 especially in your first few hours confined to the district of Old Villedor. The idea is seemingly to introduce you to a condensed version of the city\u2019s struggles and give Aiden a large parkour playground to learn in. The actual result of this on-boarding is a sluggish narrative that sends you back and forth across the region\u2019s five same-y sectors to the unending chorus of pings alerting you to a nearby encounter or loot stash. With its shallow quests, illusion of choice, and endless distractions, it seems \u2013 initially \u2013 like the worst kind of open-world filler.\r\nAnd then suddenly it isn\u2019t. The events propelling Aiden into both Dying Light 2\u2019s second half and Villedor proper are surprisingly gripping after those languid opening hours. When you finally enter the city, the first view of downtown Villedor is stunning \u2013 you glimpse it from a skyscraper\u2019s rooftop garden, right before hurling yourself off the edge and hoping your paraglider works as intended.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "176361f9-b5b9-4bc0-a830-a1b592aaf3b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "176361f9-b5b9-4bc0-a830-a1b592aaf3b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "06c2f355-cac1-40bc-9dd5-ac2241d8646a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5fef85a5f6b7a66001a895db491ea8cb32cf4cf6d73173dd61b366c873252813"}, "3": {"node_id": "91bbd608-d882-4102-9aef-87ffefabb69f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "83369c0e7a8973fc057c886ee07f2c51ff531287eb181474335df107f2310666"}}, "hash": "7b4362133ffa548fe3474a36fe22d3b95bd8306f3701c06e679d52aaf37c6874", "text": "You can see the game open up for you in this moment, it\u2019s just a shame it took so damn long.\r\nThe bigger city is infinitely more interesting in its layout, and exploring it is an absolute treat during the day (and a tense thrill at night). The pacing picks up significantly once you gain more freedom to explore, as does Techland\u2019s worldbuilding: faction conflicts grow more desperate and destructive, the disturbing facts behind Aiden\u2019s trauma become inextricably tied to the city\u2019s fate, and the narrative ends up going in a direction that \u2013 while not entirely unexpected \u2013 is still satisfying and well executed.\r\nAs spectacular as the later game\u2019s setpieces are, it\u2019s the quiet moments that stuck with me most and made me wish Techland had opted for a more refined approach to Dying Light 2 overall. \r\nOne side quest, for example, involves a timid painter asking for help obtaining the right shade of red. He admits he\u2019s been feeding a massive infected in the hopes of using its blood for the coloring and asks you to kill it for him. It\u2019s a strange juxtaposition that speaks volumes about life in Villedor and the struggles its people face, arguably more so than the drawn-out water tower fight in the game\u2019s first half. \r\nNearby, I found a rooftop camp where a small crowd had gathered around a storyteller excitedly recounting the legend of a famous Nightrunner who fought for survivors and gave them safe places to live in the city. It\u2019s not even tied to a quest. It\u2019s just a brief glimpse into the world Aiden\u2019s risking his life for. These moments are few, though, and even the more meaningful quests have no lasting effect outside of giving you new gear \u2013 no change in how you interact with the city or its people.\r\nTechland has the pieces of a fascinating world and one of the most unique takes on zombie survival, but never quite uses them to their full effect. I can\u2019t help but wish that, in place of the more standard quests and efforts to make the world feel big, the team had focused on what makes it special instead. \r\nMechanically, Dying Light 2 is also surprisingly conservative \u2013 especially in contrast to the first game \u2013 but it does innovate in a few key ways. The day/night system remains largely the same as that in the original. Infected become significantly more dangerous after sunset, and the new Howler infected variant summons a horde of zombies that chase you across the city until you reach a safe zone. But what\u2019s more interesting is the implication of being in the dark too long. \r\nBecause you\u2019re infected, you can only survive as a human for a few minutes without needing UV light or special items to restore immunity. It\u2019s a smart design choice that changes not just how you plan your quests and exploration, but how you interact with the city as well. Areas you might normally ignore \u2013 abandoned homes where the UV lights still shine or out-of-the-way safe areas \u2013 become vital stops on your route, often at the risk of exposing yourself to Howlers.\r\nCombat remains the same as the original Dying Light, broadly speaking, but some minor tweaks and iterations make it more enjoyable. Weapon mods serve a greater purpose and let you attach flamethrowers and freeze beams (among other things) to gain a strategic advantage in tough battles. The city\u2019s layout means most battles are never straightforward; verticality, opportunities for stealth, and that now-classic parkour focus weave together to give an extra layer of strategy to even the most bog-standard bandit encounters.\r\nLess enjoyable were the bugs and glitches I encountered throughout Aiden\u2019s odyssey, including some rather problematic ones. The audio randomly cut out at certain points, usually during a fight, and it was a gamble whether the paraglider would work or not \u2013 probably not the kind of survival tension Techland had in mind. There was also some screen tearing on Xbox Series S, and a tendency for fast travel locations to disappear. The developers already released a patch during the review period, and I\u2019m hopeful these issues will be ironed out at or soon after launch.\r\nDying Light 2 is messy and uneven. It\u2019s also unique, exhilarating, and just plain fun to play, with one of the best settings in recent memory \u2013 despite the nagging feeling that the game could, and should, be more than what it is. Techland has made great strides forward with the sequel, but it\u2019s clear the future of Dying Light can\u2019t be just about making a bigger city to climb around in.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91bbd608-d882-4102-9aef-87ffefabb69f": {"__data__": {"id_": "91bbd608-d882-4102-9aef-87ffefabb69f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "176361f9-b5b9-4bc0-a830-a1b592aaf3b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7b4362133ffa548fe3474a36fe22d3b95bd8306f3701c06e679d52aaf37c6874"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2966381-dee4-4dc0-916c-bdf59a2b94c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c68ed11eb08315d92405d2efc640d82f5fb590249df0007ec1e002ee9705af4"}}, "hash": "83369c0e7a8973fc057c886ee07f2c51ff531287eb181474335df107f2310666", "text": "The sequel has given the series some good breadth \u2013 now it just needs some proper depth.\r\n\n        Sign in and unlock a world of features\n      \n        Get access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nJosh Broadwell\n\n          Contributor\n        \nPlease enable JavaScript to see comments.      \n\nWAS GOING SO WELL!\n\n\nDying Light 2 tanks its reputation after months of rebuilding it                    \n\n\nCarnage Concerto\n\n\nDying Light 2 Bloody Ties DLC review: All tied up                    \n\n\nClowning Around\n\n\nDying Light 2's Bloody Ties DLC is taking us to the circus this week                    \n\n\nBow wow\n\n\nDying Light 2 gets a new season \u2014 with chapter 2 now free for everyone                    \n\n\npower and revenge\n\n\nDying Light 2 DLC Bloody Ties moved to October 13, new community update released                    \n\n\nCarnage Hall horrors\n\n\nDying Light 2's first story DLC, Bloody Ties, to be revealed at gamescom Opening Night Live                    \n\n\nFIRST NEW CHAPTER\n\n\nDying Light 2 update adds first gameplay chapter, new progression system, Photo Mode, and more                    \n\n\nNo sunset yet\n\n\n\"The well of ideas is infinite\" \u2013 Techland on Dying Light 2 DLC expectations and next game hints                    \n\n\nTEXTBOOK BOONDOGGLE\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 review: The best psychological horror game I\u2019ve played in generations                    \n\n\nGOTTA RUN\n\n\nGhostrunner 2 review: an imperfect game that understands the rule of cool                    \n\n\nLIQUID'S IN\n\n\nMetal Gear Solid Master Collection (Vol 1) review: A soft collection of solid games                    \n\n\nSHOTS MISSED\n\n\nLords of the Fallen review: fertile ground for a sequel, but leaves a lot to be desired                    \n\n\nCITY PERFORMANCE\n\n\nCities Skylines 2 review: a solid foundation for a spec-hungry future classic                    \n\n\nTUSKMASTER\n\n\nSuper Mario Bros.

Its predecessor was a fun open world action RPG that relied on fluent parkour and combat to survive the night and save the world. While the story was generic and predictable, it had responsive controls and plenty to do. One thing I felt throughout the entire playthrough was that it doesn\u2019t feel like a next-gen title. It could\u2019ve quite easily released a few years ago. That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t an improvement on the original, but the visuals do feel somewhat dated. It\u2019s a product of a lengthy development process, one that makes you wonder why it took so long.Dying Light 2 features characters you care about. The protagonist is still as generic as they come, but his journey to find his sister is one that keeps you hooked until the end. Arriving in the city as a pilgrim (a nomadic explorer), it takes a lot for people to trust you. However, as you speak to people and build friendships, the narrative becomes expansive and engaging. The most interesting characters are the ones you build relationships with. Lawan (voiced wonderfully by Rosario Dawson) is a bitter soul. She\u2019s vulnerable, but has a big heart and plays an integral role in Aiden\u2019s story.Frank is a deflated and jaded guy who doesn\u2019t trust easily. He\u2019s seen some shit, and has a hard time seeing a future that isn\u2019t as messed up as the present is. The villain, Waltz, is a fascinating man that has ulterior motives, but shares a deep connection with Aiden that culminates in a big plot twist towards the end. The decisions you make have plenty of weight. On more than one occasion, I genuinely struggled to know what to do for the best. It\u2019s clear Techland wanted to tell a more personal and engaging story than the last. Having these difficult choices make you feel responsible for the fate of the city. Whomever you side with, the developers want you to live with your actions.When you\u2019re finally free to roam about the open world, Dying Light 2 is liberating. With some fantastic upgrades to unlock that give you more freedom, the parkour is exhilarating. I always praise Mirror\u2019s Edge for its approach to free running. When you choose to move across the map without fast travelling, you know it\u2019s got you by the balls. I rarely jumped between Metro Stations to get across the map. Running across rooftops, using the paraglider, and swinging with the grappling hook is tons of fun. My biggest issue is that you don\u2019t get these straight away, especially the grappling hook. Saying that, if you\u2019re a completionist, there\u2019ll be plenty of hours after unlocking the hook where you\u2019ll be able to use it.Combat is also a thrilling facet of Dying Light 2\u2019s gameplay. There\u2019re tons of weapons to find, ranging from bows to maces to machetes. Molotov\u2019s, C4, and other explosives are also key components of Aiden\u2019s inventory. Unlocking new combat abilities help when taking on larger groups of enemies, allowing you to be more proficient when in stealth, and improving Aiden\u2019s power and general badassery. When combining parkour and combat, Dying Light 2 is phenomenal. When you look back at how you started off, there\u2019s a satisfying progression that gives you all the right tools and abilities at the right time.Outside of the main story, there\u2019re plenty of side quests and objectives to get stuck into. City Alignment sees you taking control of specific facilities and giving ownership to the survivors or the Peacekeepers (or as the cool kids in the city call them, the PKs). By handing the reigns over to survivors, additional air vents, trampoline platforms, and other parkour aids open up.

You can also unlock safe zones such as bandit camps that shield you from deadly zombies at night, and side quests that offer XP for completing tasks for individuals across the city.When night falls, the city becomes much more dangerous. Along with doing your best to avoid the streets in fear of being chased by hordes of infected, there\u2019re tons of missions and tasks where you\u2019ll be heavily rewarded. Forsaken Stores offer valuable crafting parts and Dark Hollows are where rare valuables are stored. Going in at night means fewer zombies are running around, but you\u2019ll need to be quiet or all hell breaks loose. GRE Anomalies are also on the loose at night. These Revenants are powerful infected, but killing them gains access to Inhibitors, the one tool you use to permanently improve your health and stamina.Throughout Dying Light 2, you\u2019ll find crafting parts. By completing missions or visiting Craftmasters, you\u2019ll unlock blueprints for new weapon mods and items. Not all weapons can be modified, but doing so adds increased durability of weapons and certain enhancements like electric charges. There\u2019re special infected that drop trophies, which can be used to upgrade blueprints. The loop is addictive, and you\u2019ll likely spend ages improving weapons, gear, and more here. On top of blueprints, there\u2019re tons of crates and containers to lockpick. Inside you\u2019ll find new clothing, weapons, and valuables, as well as inhibitors. At times it almost feels like Destiny or Diablo 3 with the amount of gear you pick up.Throughout the main story, Dying Light 2 never gets dull or repetitive. The missions are engaging, as are the characters. You really feel like you\u2019re fighting for something. Aiden may not be the most interesting protagonist, but his story is great. The visuals aren\u2019t as good as they could be, but that\u2019s probably down to how long it\u2019s been in development. Gameplay wise, I loved every second of it. The night is always more terrifying than the day, and Techland has made sure you\u2019re fully aware of the risk of stepping outside when the clock strikes 8pm. Dying Light 2 is a big improvement on the first game, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like a fully-fledged sequel. Saying that, it does offer tens of hours of content, potentially hundreds for those willing to do everything, and when it\u2019s this much fun to play, you\u2019ve certainly got value for money.Engaging story\nGameplay is a lot of fun\nPlenty to do\nLawan is awesomeNot a massive visual improvement\nGeneric protagonist\nFeels similar to the first\nGrappling hook takes a while to unlockWhile Dying Light 2 may not feel like a massive step up, it's still tons of fun, and the story is a powerful and engaging one, vastly improved from the original.

It was an enjoyable zombie adventure, largely due to its unique parkour system, but that was pretty much the only thing the game had going for it at launch. The game has come a surprisingly long way since its launch though, and the original Dying Light has become one of the most beloved zombie games in recent memory through word of mouth and incredibly dedicated post-launch support. It may not seem like that much time has passed since the first game was released, but it\u2019s been 7 years since the game shipped and updates have still been dropping even in the days leading up to the sequel\u2019s release.To put that in perspective, when Dying Light launched, the first episode of Life is Strange was days away from release, the world had not yet seen the likes of Bloodborne, The Witcher 3, or Metal Gear Solid V, and Bethesda was months away from hosting its first-ever E3 conference. The point is, Dying Light 2 is releasing into a wholly different industry than its predecessor, and it needs to do more than slap a fun parkour system onto a mediocre zombie game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd956218-acf4-4242-9b4d-84454660d48c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd956218-acf4-4242-9b4d-84454660d48c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b6bf012-1fc4-4748-afea-04eae667cf62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a24819704b7ee215051374d5f58a42aa23abfbcb1066b41c10a397e6c73d9a13"}, "3": {"node_id": "f731522b-4434-439f-9661-d814f94fcf3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7fef26311cd86608a10e6673aa0245c2983bec35798d4d7a3806e9830e24a314"}}, "hash": "2bd9417d9ae7f46ed89fbb1f5099582fe8f2e5315c53980f0b53df86e858f4ff", "text": "The stakes are understandably high for the sequel, and Dying Light 2 has a lot to live up to.Techland\u2019s ambitious promises leading up to release have only added to the hype, and while Dying Light 2 doesn\u2019t quite fulfill the promise of a living, breathing city where every single decision can alter the course of the story, it\u2019s still a remarkably well-made sequel that delivers on practically every front. After spending dozens of hours across two playthroughs sprinting through the streets (and across the rooftops) of Dying Light 2\u2019s Villedor, it\u2019s clear that Techland\u2019s vision for this ambitious sequel mostly stuck the landing.Even though there\u2019s a giant number 2 attached to the title, Dying Light 2 is a standalone story set in an entirely different location than the first game. There are very minor references to the first game that eagle-eyed fans will catch, but you can go into this game totally blind and still have an excellent time. Dying Light 2 takes place many years after the first game too, and the virus has progressed to the point where there are very few populated cities remaining at all. You play as Aiden, who comes to the city of Villedor in search of his missing sister. Aiden is a Pilgrim, a sort of messenger that travels between the few remaining settlements to deliver goods and messages. Because of his status as a Pilgrim, he is an outsider to the citizens of Villedor and must slowly gain their trust while also working through his own personal story, making decisions that will shape the city\u2019s future along the way.As you\u2019d expect, the parkour is the shining star of Dying Light 2. The traversal in the first game was already great, but the sequel improves upon it in every way. Aiden feels a bit lighter than Crane did in the first game, so you can reach ledges and cross gaps with ease. There\u2019s a parkour-centric skill tree that unlocks new abilities like wall-running, a super satisfying long jump that lets you boost off of ledges, and much more. Once you have a few parkour skills under your belt, you really start to feel like you\u2019re flying through the city.There are a few additional tools at your disposal this time around as well, namely a paraglider and a grappling hook. Both start out fairly underwhelming, but with upgrades, they become integral to traversal. The paraglider can eventually boost to help you maintain altitude, and the grappling hook can be attached to basically any point on any surface, allowing you to freely swing around the city. When upgraded, the grappling hook even lets you pull yourself forward using the rope, which basically lets you swing through the city like Spider-Man. It\u2019s very easy to enter a flow state when you\u2019re using all of your tools in one long parkour combo. Jumping off of a roof, using the paraglider to reach a lower ledge, wall-running on a skyscraper, and then using the grappling hook to pull yourself into a window, there really aren\u2019t any places you can\u2019t reach in Dying Light 2.That\u2019s mostly due to the outstanding world design. Creating linear parkour paths is hard enough, but designing an entire city with two huge districts and making every single possible route flow together naturally is no easy task. There\u2019s always something a platform just within jumping distance, a ledge just within your arm\u2019s reach. Buildings interiors feel perfectly placed, cars (which are safe landing spots from any height) are parked in just the right spots. Every block of Villedor feels handcrafted like a perfect concrete jungle gym.A massive world is nothing without activities to fill it, however, and Dying Light 2\u2019s city always has something going on. Random encounters can take place all over the city, ranging from saving wounded survivors to taking out bandits to battling special infected. The rewards for these always feel worthwhile, usually leading you to a chest with a weapon or gear piece. Windmills are scattered all across Villedor and provide power to local settlements, unlocking new vendors and, more importantly, new side quests. Water towers and electrical substations, with the former being parkour challenges and the latter being puzzle rooms, can be assigned to one of two factions in order to increase their control of the city.Dark hollows and abandoned stores are filled with gear and valuables, but your only chance of surviving them is at nighttime, which is another fantastic change made in this sequel. Both daytime and nighttime excursions have their own benefits and activities. Infected are asleep inside dark buildings during the day, making the streets safer to traverse, but you can\u2019t get inside any buildings to loot resources or gear.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f731522b-4434-439f-9661-d814f94fcf3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f731522b-4434-439f-9661-d814f94fcf3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd956218-acf4-4242-9b4d-84454660d48c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2bd9417d9ae7f46ed89fbb1f5099582fe8f2e5315c53980f0b53df86e858f4ff"}, "3": {"node_id": "98a29008-4888-4a89-94af-e168976ee11e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0b57f4e8b1fc376113536e2cb88267edc929190b6d26185da47e76d53d743b0"}}, "hash": "7fef26311cd86608a10e6673aa0245c2983bec35798d4d7a3806e9830e24a314", "text": "If you wait until nightfall, you can get inside and face fewer infected foes, but you\u2019ll have to stick to the rooftops and avoid the now crowded streets to get there.There\u2019s even a new chase system, which is basically a wanted level, that begins when you\u2019re spotted by a new special infected class called a Howler. To end a chase, you must either get far away enough from the infected or reach a safe zone with UV lights. You\u2019re also limited by a timer at night that decreases when you\u2019re in the dark, but it lasts a few minutes and can be fully restored with items or by stepping into UV light for a short time. All of these nighttime changes make the day/night cycle matter much more in Dying Light 2, and there\u2019s no longer a reason to sleep until morning every time it gets dark. It\u2019s an engaging risk/reward mechanic that actually encourages nighttime play.The game\u2019s audio design also plays a large part in making Villedor a fun place to explore. During the day, there\u2019s great music that swells up as you do more parkour, and you can hear distant survivors clearing out infected or fighting with bandits. Things really get intense when the sun goes down though. Nighttime is permeated with the shrieks of faraway infected and the screams of survivors making their last stand. It\u2019s genuinely harrowing at times, and it really sells the idea that nighttime is not the best time to be out and about.Audio also makes combat feel much more visceral. Techland has removed guns from this sequel entirely, so it\u2019s just melee weapons and bows this time around. The crack of a bat against a bandit\u2019s skull, the clang of a metal pipe blocking a machete strike, every attack feels and sounds like it has actual weight behind it. Aiden is also very vocal during combat encounters, grunting and yelling with every swing and huffing and puffing when he\u2019s low on stamina. The enemies do the same, and even though it\u2019s a small touch, it goes a long way in making fights feel like life or death duels between actual people.Combat is much more than just swinging sticks around though. Parkour plays a large role in fights, and it can be the difference between life or death in some situations. One of the first actions you unlock allows you to vault over stunned enemies to kick one of their allies, and you can unlock other parkour attacks like dropkicks and perfect dodges as you level up. Enemies will regularly block standard attacks too, forcing you to mix things up to land consecutive hits. The game gives you so much flexibility when it comes to combat encounters, and that\u2019s very appreciated.One of the major selling points of Dying Light 2 is the city control system, which adjusts Villedor\u2019s overall faction alignment based on which facilities you assign to which faction. There are only two factions in Dying Light 2, and each is basically the polar opposite of the other. There are the Peacekeepers, a militaristic faction that values security and order above all, even if that comes at the cost of personal freedoms. Opposed to them are the Survivors, which are, well, everyone else. The Survivors value freedom and community, hoping that the people of Villedor can put aside their differences and make sure everyone has what they need to survive.If one of those sounds like the obvious choice over the other, then you\u2019d be right. The main problem with the dual faction dynamic in Dying Light 2 is that the Peacekeepers just aren\u2019t as appealing as the Survivors. The initial Peacekeeper grunts you deal with aren\u2019t the most likable people in the world, and even though the higher-ups you interact with later in the story are a bit more charismatic, it\u2019s still hard to shake the first impression that their ideology makes. They\u2019re not as comically evil as, say, Caesar\u2019s Legion from Fallout: New Vegas, a faction with an ideology that nobody legitimately supported unless they were a fascist or just delusional, but it\u2019s still hard to see the Peacekeepers as the faction that\u2019s supposed to be \u201cthe bad guys.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say the Peacekeepers don\u2019t have interesting or sympathetic characters within their ranks or that the Survivors don\u2019t come with their own share of problems, but it feels like the game really leans toward you running with the Survivors for your real run and then just messing around with the Peacekeepers on a repeat playthrough.Outside of the narrative problems with the factions, the gameplay side of things also didn\u2019t pan out all that well.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98a29008-4888-4a89-94af-e168976ee11e": {"__data__": {"id_": "98a29008-4888-4a89-94af-e168976ee11e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f731522b-4434-439f-9661-d814f94fcf3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7fef26311cd86608a10e6673aa0245c2983bec35798d4d7a3806e9830e24a314"}, "3": {"node_id": "9eee1f80-a1c7-4abd-b508-1e131d90e0d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1cc0b1f1303277a2dc2e801b0afd0e70bc81f0d3ee8923751d655cfb2020cfaf"}}, "hash": "d0b57f4e8b1fc376113536e2cb88267edc929190b6d26185da47e76d53d743b0", "text": "Each faction has a skill line that you progress through by assigning facilities to them, so a choice that should be a serious narrative decision (who gets control of a district) ends up being reduced purely to \u201cwhich reward do I want next.\u201d The game is heavily biased toward the Survivors in this aspect as well, since they will place incredibly useful parkour assists like trampolines and zip lines around town. The only cool thing the Peacekeepers really have is a crossbow. The gameplay rewards should have been given out based on how many facilities you\u2019ve unlocked in total, that way you would base your decision on which faction is best for the city overall.With how much the faction and city control system was hyped up prior to launch, the current implementation in Dying Light 2 feels half-baked. Most players won\u2019t even think about it all that much outside of the rewards, as most of the major faction decisions come through the main story anyway. This system would have been much more engaging if it was more dynamic, perhaps with each faction retaking each other\u2019s zones like in Saints Row. It\u2019s an interesting foundation, but in its current state, it\u2019s underwhelming.Thankfully, the faction dynamic works much better in the game\u2019s main narrative. Dying Light 2\u2019s overall plot is not very interesting. Aiden comes to Villedor searching for his sister, but Aiden\u2019s quest to find his sister is easily the weakest part of the story. Dying Light 2\u2019s story is at its best when it\u2019s either letting you make serious decisions or letting you spend some quiet time with the supporting cast.Choices were heralded as one of the major new features of Dying Light 2, with players supposedly being able to shape the city in many different ways. While the choices aren\u2019t as in-depth as the marketing would have you believe, the narrative can branch pretty heavily, resulting in different quest lines, locales, and characters. The game pauses and gives you a timer when you\u2019re given a decision that will actually have consequences, but normal dialogue options can still lead to different quest paths, particularly in side quests.The big decisions have equally large consequences, and you\u2019ll usually be locked out of something or cause a major character death by going one way or the other. You may want to go with the Survivors for one decision, for instance, but the Peacekeepers have better resources and could also be a good choice. Since these decisions are made independent of the city control system, you can choose purely based on what you feel is right. This can lead to some uneasy alliances with characters you may have never worked with otherwise, and it\u2019s unlikely that most players will make the same overall decisions during a playthrough since everyone will probably have different takes on certain characters and plans.Ironically, side quests feel like they give much more control to the player than the main story. The main story is quite linear until you reach a predetermined branching point, but in most side quests, your normal dialogue options can dramatically affect the outcomes. All side quests are self-contained as well, serving as bite-sized stories that flesh out Villedor and give you a great sense of agency within the narrative. The side quests range from short comedic tales to fake kidnappings to trade deals gone wrong. There\u2019s a ton of variety and you never really know if you\u2019re going to get a shockingly heartfelt side story or a fun little adventure.At the end of the day, though, Dying Light 2 is carried by its characters. Aiden is likable, if a bit unremarkable, but it\u2019s those he hangs out with that are the highlight of the game. Lawan in particular, portrayed by Rosario Dawson, is the heart of the story, and she steals just about every scene she\u2019s in. Characters like Hakon and Frank are easy favorites as well, equally great for comic relief and tugging at the heartstrings, and on the Peacekeeper side of things, you have characters like the proud but composed Jack Matt.The scenes and decisions involving these characters are infinitely more compelling than the overarching Peacekeepers vs. Survivors power struggle. Do you forsake your personal quest to save a friend\u2019s life? Do you forgive someone, even if they\u2019ve seriously wronged you? If the possibility of a liar arises, who do you trust? It\u2019s not just the big decisions like those that matter, but also the smaller, more personal ones, like choosing the best strategy to take when comforting a friend in a time of need. Despite a blank slate protagonist and a so-so antagonist, Dying Light 2\u2019s character moments are surprisingly affecting.That\u2019s largely due to the performances of everyone involved.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9eee1f80-a1c7-4abd-b508-1e131d90e0d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9eee1f80-a1c7-4abd-b508-1e131d90e0d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cf3f33c8-1b84-4551-bdc6-be7bc40c0636", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c7c10194b747f1e80ceaea79d66d855bd43d11d2987149a4b488ccca4b49ba5"}, "2": {"node_id": "98a29008-4888-4a89-94af-e168976ee11e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0b57f4e8b1fc376113536e2cb88267edc929190b6d26185da47e76d53d743b0"}}, "hash": "1cc0b1f1303277a2dc2e801b0afd0e70bc81f0d3ee8923751d655cfb2020cfaf", "text": "Aiden\u2019s personality isn\u2019t all that intriguing, but his voice actor nailed his performance.

The game\u2019s performances really elevate what would be average writing, and they help the good characters stand out even more. Facial animations could have used some work, especially since the game never breaks from the first-person perspective so you\u2019re always close to people\u2019s faces, but they\u2019re good enough and the voice acting helps to cover that stuff up.What is most exciting about Dying Light 2, however, is the promise of what\u2019s coming next. Techland has already committed to 5 years of post-launch support, and while we\u2019ll see how far that support ends up going, the first Dying Light establishes a promising blueprint. Compared to its launch version, the original Dying Light is a much, much better game today. Knowing Dying Light 2 will get that same treatment is exciting.Dying Light 2 is a bigger and bolder sequel that improves upon the original in every way. Not only does it have one of the most enjoyable traversal systems in any game ever, but it also provides players with interesting characters and quests to break up all the running. The faction system is disappointing in its current iteration, but it sets up a solid foundation that can absolutely be built upon. Most people were expecting top-notch gameplay from a Dying Light sequel, but the story and characters ended up being pleasant surprises. When it comes to open-world zombie games, it\u2019s hard to do better than Dying Light 2.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.\n\nCurrently serving as an Associate Editor at Attack of the Fanboy, Diego Perez has been writing about video games since 2018, specializing in live service games like Destiny and Final Fantasy XIV.
