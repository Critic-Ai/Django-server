Story, art, music, voice-acting, atmosphere? A+. Combat? Kind of B-. Hades feels like a response to that, a Supergiant game that focuses on the fighting and elevates it to the absolute top-tier. This isn't a spoiler because you've looked at the score, but they nailed it. The combat's fantastic.Hades doesn't short us on the other stuff either, though it easily could have. It's a roguelike, or a roguelite, or an action-RPG with permadeath. Whatever you call it, it's a genre where story is secondary, either hidden away in the lore encyclopedia or otherwise in the back seat\u2014the back seat of one of those cars with a window separating it from the driver.Not so in Hades, where every character is fully voiced and has more to say with every run. You're Zagreus, son of the death god, prince of the underworld. You believe the whole \"ruling in Hell\" thing is overrated, so with the help of your distant Olympian family you're going to fight through every shade, fury, and other mythic monster between you and the surface to escape. Because fuck you, Dad, that's why.The best Greek myths are about gods and heroes, and when ordinary mortals are involved they boil down to fairytale morals about how you should obey your weird husband no matter what because he might turn out to be the West Wind. Hades knows this, and focuses on legendary characters like Athena and Achilles, painting them in broad archetypal strokes. My favorite's Dionysus, god of wine, hedonism, and everybody just being like really cool, but everyone from long-suffering fury Megaera to layabout Sisyphus is brought to life, with a solid vocal portrayal and art like they stepped out of a Mike Mignola comic.Where other games hand out story as a reward for success, Hades uses it to reward failure. With each death Zagreus is sent back to the House of Hades where his father judges souls and legends gather. Doing a circuit of the court to see what new things they have to say (and give Cerberus a pat), lets you wind down and take a breath after your latest death has left your hands shaking. When I die in Dead Cells I want to quit, but in Hades the sting's immediately removed because I get to chat with an embodiment of night and see what's up with Orpheus. Then, back in the zone, I buy another round of upgrades and try again.At the start of each run you pick a legendary weapon, like the Aegis shield, accept a boon, like the one from Dionysus that adds hangover damage (read \"poison\") to your attacks, and enter the first of the underworld's three realms. They're made up of randomized chambers where a set number of enemies spawn, you vanquish them, collect a reward, and enter the next chamber.Every weapon's agreeably unique. Hold down attack with the shield and you'll block, then bull-rush forward. Its special lets you bounce it off enemies then catch it like Hellenic Captain America. The spear can also be thrown and recalled, but only comes back when commanded, letting you reposition first and line up new shades to skewer, while its hold-down attack is an area-of-effect spin. Then there's the Adamant Rail, which is literally a gun, complete with grenade launcher attachment.In addition you've got a ranged attack called a cast and can unlock a call, an ultimate granted by whichever god you've got favor with that's earned by filling up a god gauge.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f83fe7a2-7449-4545-9d2a-2cb84d31f3fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f83fe7a2-7449-4545-9d2a-2cb84d31f3fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "4576b68b-5fdc-4311-bff5-e8b9f54c0b4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "487b9408e06988b35892e0c0d8b921af11d80da0239f41ffeae367b254e3bdd3"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3d4ed20-26ba-4f2d-b855-2da1d0d43869", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "453c7da6138adc544a41b50c8f57149174b5c64e5ab6ca59a40f0d8de6bbe8e5"}}, "hash": "f90a4a4bc4916852c58ee195323fa11926a1b440f7f47a82d72f961dd1a736d3", "text": "I often forget about the call because that gauge doesn't stand out beneath the attention-grabbing red health bar, though sometimes a text pop-up will remind me (probably because the game knows I rarely use the thing).\u00a0The real star in your arsenal is a dash that can take you through enemies and objects, and combines with attacks for a dash-strike. Whoever's responsible for the timing and animation should pat themselves on the back, because dashing feels great, whether used to backstab a skeleton, or to warp through a column just as the minotaur charges so he slams his cowlick into a big lump of marble instead of me.Mobility's essential, not just to avoid attacks but to set up wall slams for bonus damage, trigger traps then dash out of the blast zone, and knock down support columns to bring down chunks of masonry. Getting into a rhythm, launching a combo then zooming around the battlefield like I've got wings on my sandals, puts me in such a focused flow-state I don't notice the soundtrack accentuating the action. If a game can distract me from Darren Korb rocking out then it's doing everything right.What Hades' combat reminds me of is Bastion's dream challenges, especially when played with oddball late-game weapon combinations. Bastion's combat was seen as its weak spot, but my hot take about a game from 2011 is that the fighting ruled actually, and Hades feels like an evolution of it\u2014only invoking gods in Hades gives blessings instead of curses and upgrades can be bought mid-run as well as back at your hub.I should talk about the upgrades, yeah? Gold coins, obols from the eyes of the dead, can be spent at Charon's shop when it pops up in a chamber for temporary buffs and heals, while shards of darkness can be spent in the House of Hades for permanent upgrades, like backstab damage or the ability to defy death and come back at half-health when you'd otherwise fall. Gems buy renovations for the hub but also for the underworld, adding rooms with healing pools or urns that can be smashed for obols.I haven't even mentioned the diamonds, titan blood, and other currencies later in the game. It may sound like a bit much, but it's handed out at an even pace, and the steady improvements feel balanced to my own improvement as I play. Shortly after I got used to working cast attacks into my dash-reliant tactics, I bought an upgrade for more damage to anyone I've used my cast on. There's a parity between its rewards and my own skills, both pushing me further. It's the most I've been engaged with a roguelike's upgrade tree since Rogue Legacy.That's half of what keeps me coming back to Hades, and the other half is the unfolding story of Zagreus. He could easily have been the worst flavor of videogame protagonist, an angry buff princeling smoldering with generic rage. Instead it's his father Hades, a goth beefcake Santa who spends all day shouting at paperwork and moaning about his underlings, who fills that role. Zagreus is likeable, with a wry sense of humor, and when Hades sarcastically asks how the latest attempt at trashing the realm goes he replies, \"My ransacking was a delight, thanks for asking.\" The prince also just seems like a decent person, listening to shades when they talk about how they died, appreciating the house servant who is also a severed gorgon head, and taking note of who the employee of the day is while saying, hey, good for you, Achilles.Sure, I want every run to end in victory, but I also want to buy that music stand for the throne room, unlock all the keepsakes, and see how this romantic subplot plays out. Like Orpheus I look back, only unlike him I'm happy to keep repeating this cycle.Action so intense it'll leave you jittery and hopped-up on adrenaline, and characters to die for.Jody's first computer was a Commodore 64, so he remembers having to use a code wheel to play Pool of Radiance.

It's made of mythology, of course - Zeus and Nyx and all that other spontaneous, terrifying, pitiable lot who have been lurking in their own form of Early Access for millenia. And it's made of everything the developer Supergiant has learned from making dashing, finely poised action games like Bastion and Transistor - and storied, wilful, luminous oddities like Pyre. \r\nBut it's also made of stone so smoothly polished it reads like glass or water. It's made of lap pools of blood, of palm columns shot through with arteries of twinkling jewels. Even when you're pushing a raft across lava there's a sense that the rocks around you are just so, that they melt and ooze because artists have thought about their insides, and are in love, above all else, with texture. After every run of Zagreus' attempts to escape the underworld, he returns to a house that is positively lurid with texture and sharp edges and glimmer. The famed gods live in a sort of McMansion, or a Las Vegas hotel's Presidential Suite, bad taste spared absolutely no expense. Of course they live somewhere like this. Maybe life and death is just one big casino. Maybe these gods play dice and then hit the slots.Most of this textured stuff is designed to shatter. Hades is a Roguelite brawler, so each run is a run into hell and, hopefully, out the other side, and in between failures you spend earnings on new abilities and unlocks. But brawler is too padded and fleshy and imprecise a word, the clumsy heel of a palm, the stub of a haphazard elbow. During the run, during the failures, you are a wrecking ball with the focus of a laser, taking down pillars, slamming things into walls, blasting stone and crystal into shrapnel clouds of thick, gritty air. Supergiant chose Zagreus as a protagonist because he is a bit of a pencil shadow in the mythological texts - hazy shape and no real substance, a whisper of graphite. The writing team styles him as the kind of irresistibly arch Ivy League hardnut that Donna Tartt writes about so well, bruised cheekbones and dewy forehead, lip a dissolute twist just waiting to attain its precarious hold on a Gauloise. He is charismatic and chancy, refined without being remotely delicate. But then the game's action comes along and turns him into the part of every episode of The Property Brothers where teardown kicks in - mallet meets plasterboard and the sky is busy with splintered timber. The kitchen becomes a crater in seconds. The violence is backed by the unflinching heft of metal. What a complicated fellow.None of the rest of the game would matter if it wasn't fun to hit things. And on this topic, I've sometimes worried that Supergiant, a developer blessed and cursed with rare taste, is going to end up a victim of that taste, turning out theoretically exquisite mechanisms that chime a little hollow. I've worried that the team's output will even gloss away into mere brute luxury - Lambos or Swarovski swans. I'm wrong so far! What's surprising about Hades, to me at least, is how gutsy it is, how vitally in love with connection it is. It lives to clobber. Room after room of hell. You turn up and wait for horrors. The horrors arrive and, jeepers, you shred them. You pulverise them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e67fcc4-b54e-4e30-91c3-0566b5b51d15": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e67fcc4-b54e-4e30-91c3-0566b5b51d15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3d4ed20-26ba-4f2d-b855-2da1d0d43869", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "453c7da6138adc544a41b50c8f57149174b5c64e5ab6ca59a40f0d8de6bbe8e5"}, "3": {"node_id": "e8c8b32e-0be5-4790-94e4-1825767026f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "256126892ae7ed52ebf799737abb4b9f188f364c407f6f770d3731b928f6dae3"}}, "hash": "ced703f38656fa9fd19e9686db50504f6b83f35708ec8214983c76d5babd1d0a", "text": "You pulverise them. I have never felt so sorry for the stuff of nightmares.Combat is based on a main attack and a special, along with a dodge and a cast, which means you lob a glossy gem into a baddy and it does them ill, but then lodges there, annoyingly, for longer than you might want it to. Beyond that it's based on weapon choices that define how attacks and specials play out. Arrows and flinging shields are my favourite options to pick between at the moment - Hawkeye's fine, but it's great to be Captain America. Beyond that, though, or rather deep down and underneath it all - I was moving in the wrong direction with those 'beyonds' and now I can't fix it - it's about this feeling the game has. And it's the same feeling you get from the Vegas hotel landscape of the early areas, even when you're gadding through the heather of Elysium - you sock-slide and grip suddenly, smooth and swift and then THWACK. Everything is a spin on this feeling: coasting on air, and then colliding. The darting hummingbird and the copper-bottomed saucepan.The things you're smacking around are wonderful. Even early on you can expect bloated ghosts with huge bellies, flesh stained the sunset colours of Florida cocktails, nasty little all-legged things with sacks of horrors on their backs. Later how about a massive snake of bones, a deadly library book stamp, bullet-hell witches and a field filled with butterfly spewing gumballs? Bosses are great and draw from the classics, but I particularly love a cluster of gems from the very first rooms that bobbles around before striking you from afar. It is so hard to be personally aggrieved by jewelry, but Hades manages to get you there. It makes glittering stone something you can hate with woozy passion.These things come at you in waves, in procedurally scrambled rooms that have their own deadly doodads. In the first areas, you generally only have to worry about spike pits or turrets with trigger pads, so I leaned rather heavily on that dash. But then the second area throws lava everywhere, so overzealous dashing generally ends in unintentional barbecue. Onwards and upwards - risk and reward, risk and reward. And then...?You choose which rooms to travel through from a handful of doors that appear when you clear out all the baddies. Generally you're picking between what kind of pay-off you want once the next battle is done. The old gods were so baldly transactional. More health? One of a handful of in-game currencies for levelling up over time? Or a chance to get a gift from the squabbling cast of ancients?This might be one of my favourite things about Hades. Over many runs you get stronger and last longer and get different weapons to try out. Fine. But each individual run is shaped by the gods you meet and the things you choose when they offer you a handful of their themed perks to pick from. Like the contents of the shopkeeper's store in Spelunky, this stuff can really mix things up and define an adventure. And the choices are often almost impossible. A dash that poisons or an attack that poisons? More doom or a brand new special? Do I want the people I have already killed, right, to make living enemies sick?The gods who deliver this stuff are wonderfully charming and untrustworthy and vain and drunken - the underworld is a Bluth Company construct, right down to the McMansion you all live in - but what really clicks for me is the way that this procedural game allows you to procedurally clip together your own Zagreus each time, and each time it's bittersweet because you know things won't fall together in quite this way ever again. It's sad in Spelunky when I don't get the jetpack, but for one glorious ten minute spell in Hades I had a shield that bounced around between enemies for a hilariously long time and left electricity in its clattering wake. I could chuck my shield, do the school run and return in time to catch it in the middle of a room in which everyone but me had been fatally pummelled in my absence. Meanwhile my dash spawned dark little infernal whirlpools that dragged enemies in for extra damage. Haven't Lego-bricked that one together again since.When it's done it's back to Dad's house to mope into the bedroom, spend a few upgrade points, chat to the relatives and then head out once more.

Of course it is. But each circuit fills out the characters and deepens the connections until I have started to warm to Zagreus, for all his poise and chill.All of which is to say: Hades is a proper lark. I love it. But there is something else here, something that I have always felt about games but never been able to put into words. There is something about polished, smartly conceived Hades, about so many of Supergiant's games which, the joyous brilliance of Pyre aside perhaps, are always too rigorous, too responsibly conceived not to know exactly what spot they're going to fit into on the shelf, which pillars they're going to present to the press - there is something about these games that are so assuredly products that reminds me that games are never ever just products. Games are always a way of being. To play Hades, Roguelite aside, economy aside, loop aside, is to be furious and vengeful, to be driven by bitterness, self-hate, ennui, to be pulverisingly powerful and yet horribly efficient. This is the truth of it down to the controls, which encourage you to grip the pad by the facebuttons and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze like you're one stress ball away from telling your boss to shove it.This game comes from Hell, and it takes you back there, and it's brilliant.

There\u2019s a still a fair number of those about but the more prevalent clich\u00e9 nowadays is punishingly difficult roguelikes with randomly generated dungeons. That describes Hades to a tee but that shouldn\u2019t be a taken as a negative, after all it\u2019s not as if the gaming world is short of online shooters or open world games. True originality is rare, but a game of Hades\u2019 quality is also far from commonplace.What might raise an additional eyebrow though is that Hades follows a very similar style of combat and presentation to developer Supergiant\u2019s previous games Bastion and Transistor. The differences are more profound than they first seem, but this is yet another of their titles that uses a very zoomed-out isometric viewpoint and relies on unusually garrulous characters to provide much of its atmosphere.The set-up here is more straightforward than Supergiant\u2019s previous games, since the plot of the game can be summarised simply as \u2018Zagreus, son of Hades, wants to escape from the underworld\u2019. At first things really are as simple as that sounds, with Zagreus portrayed as a sort of friendlier version of old school Kratos and able to carve a significant swathe through his father\u2019s forces before inevitably dying and\u2026 going back to try again.Every time Zagreus succumbs he returns to the game\u2019s starting point, where his father and his underlings work away, relatively unconcerned at his exploits. Once you venture out again the layout of the dungeons completely resets and you lose all your items, although like most modern roguelikes you do get to keep your in-game currency as well as your current relationship with all the various gods and monsters you\u2019ve met along the way \u2013 which in turn can grant you other permanent items and aids.Not only is the use of Greek mythology reminiscent of God Of War but so too is the combat, in that it\u2019s not quite as complex as Devil May Cry and Bayonetta but certainly more involved than your average light and heavy attack button-masher. The similarities end there though and while Zagreus has access to a wide range of different weapons, special moves, and ranged attacks, the skill of using them is only half the challenge compared to deciding which abilities you actually take into battle.You quickly build up a wide variety of different moves and buffs, that at first you\u2019ll just pick and choose largely at random, before subsequent runs reveal how they can all work together to make you considerably more powerful than with a less optimised set-up. Whether you want to emphasise speed, defence, attack, or the use of a particular weapon depends on both your natural playstyle and which boss character you\u2019re currently having trouble with, but rarely has a loadout mattered so much outside of a hardcore role-playing game.What makes acquiring new items especially interesting though is that most are portrayed as boons from the gods and so which you take with you affects your relationship with your would-be peers and can open up otherwise hidden side quests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d4b4e09-33b1-4ee3-b160-32b890ae0cca": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d4b4e09-33b1-4ee3-b160-32b890ae0cca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "75f78522-e9c3-4d0a-b17b-1ae7141995cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c71de5c5171c545eafe9a2d8423a75e460d2f6201b12cf837b4a41a662af5e2d"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b7fa0f9-036a-4681-a1fa-7ae0ce9b97b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53b52206d22cd5d3a8a3288f4bad9c780d8004483c9cb8e174a8598622d6acd8"}}, "hash": "eff6efa3dbc85ba4eb2e93f26bd9e4ed782144d3e1066206ebc7806ae8e6bc8a", "text": "Each god offers a different style of benefit but you can\u2019t have them all, which often ends up offending whoever\u2019s help you decline \u2013 which can cause a lot of trouble when it ends up being used against you.(The game\u2019s use of Greek myths is excellent throughout and far more interesting than the simplistic clich\u00e9s found in most other games, as Hades captures not only the petty callousness of the ancient gods but also their very human motivations.)The most unexpected pleasure that Hades offers is that you begin to measure progress not just in literal terms, as you get closer and closer to escaping to the mortal world, but how much of the plot you\u2019ve unravelled. Returning to Hades\u2019 realm each time you die not only gives you the chance to talk to your dad again but also a range of other characters of varying degrees of helpfulness.A roguelike with a proper story is almost unheard of and while Hades doesn\u2019t have a clear-cut ending, with plot revelations and character arcs continuing on into the end game, the narrative becomes just as much of a motivation for continued play as improving your combat skills. The dialogue is good throughout and, as ever for Supergiant, the voiceovers are excellent.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader\u2019s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepAs with any game that relies on randomly generated maps you can\u2019t help but imagine that it would\u2019ve been even better if more of it was handcrafted, especially as a lot of the chambers in Hades look rather samey as it is. We also found the art design on a lot of the enemies to be disappointingly unimaginative \u2013 they\u2019re fine but lack the same spark of inventiveness that underlines the rest of the game.It also has to be said that this is not something that\u2019s very well suited to playing in handheld mode, as the graphics already seem small on a TV and the action can be difficult to read on just the Switch\u2019s small screen. That aside this is one of the most forward-thinking roguelikes of recent years, that not only gets the meat and potatoes of combat and exploration right but, with the interwoven narrative, adds a new ingredient you never would\u2019ve imagined would work so well.Hades may not seem particularly remarkable at first glance, but its quiet innovation is one of the best surprises of the year and while technically it is yet another indie roguelike it\u2019s one of the best of the generation.In Short: A hell of a good roguelike, supported by a surprisingly strong narrative that provides just as much motivation to persevere as the excellent combat system.Pros: Well-conceived combat that encourages experimentation via an impressive array of weapons, abilities, and buffs.

Through a seemingly limitless array of character interactions and plot progression, Hades seeds its storytelling over many hours of repeated runs, as you lead your character along one attempted escape from hell to the next. In addition to weapon and character upgrades, new story insights are among the most satisfying rewards. But that also means that you\u2019ll be eager to see those plot threads resolve, and to do that, you should prepare for an especially long road.Zagreus is the son of mighty Hades, who rules the realm of the dead with a barely controlled anger only matched by his insistence on total control.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b7fa0f9-036a-4681-a1fa-7ae0ce9b97b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b7fa0f9-036a-4681-a1fa-7ae0ce9b97b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d4b4e09-33b1-4ee3-b160-32b890ae0cca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "eff6efa3dbc85ba4eb2e93f26bd9e4ed782144d3e1066206ebc7806ae8e6bc8a"}, "3": {"node_id": "377ae5df-4d2a-4815-ab8a-aca533a34d6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f554e4c176811d99592cd227cd21821853f47055999741f8510f73904e8a2bf"}}, "hash": "53b52206d22cd5d3a8a3288f4bad9c780d8004483c9cb8e174a8598622d6acd8", "text": "He\u2019s the definition of an overbearing father, and Zagreus\u2019 desire to strike out on his own feels as much like a family drama as the retelling of a familiar mythology. His quest to find a mother he\u2019s never known brings him into contact with a who\u2019s who of Olympus and the Greek ancient world, including Zeus, Athena, Achilles, and Medusa. The constantly shifting dynamics between these characters makes for great fun, from the sibling rivalry among the Olympians to reconnecting old flames like Orpheus and Eurydice, and I love the way story tidbits creep in both between action sequences and during them.Each escape attempt encompasses a series of isometric arena battles, assaulting an impressive variety of enemies in throwdowns that demand precision and careful observation. The combat is fast-paced and challenging, nodding more to stylish action games like Devil May Cry than the isometric RPGs it might look like at first glance. The sense of adrenaline is always high, but there\u2019s also a potential for encounters to devolve into frantic button mashing as you spam out every available attack to bring foes down before they can unleash their worst counters.New weapons unlock regularly, and they can dramatically change your playstyle, from the precision of the Heart-Seeking Bow to the furious melee dominance of the Twin Fists of Malphon. The most impressive design feat is how even the same weapon inevitably feels different on each run, as god-gifted boons alter and enhance individual armaments, spells, and other abilities. As I got into the rhythm of flowing from one death into my next attempt, I was consistently excited to see how my approach might change.Among the many familiar names encountered, Zagreus gets to know the good-natured Sisyphus, who endlessly pushes a boulder up a hill he will never top, never complaining of his task. It\u2019s an appropriate allegory that speaks to the broader game, which kept me engaged thanks to its slow drip of character improvement and fiction, but along a path that felt increasingly Sisyphean the longer I played. I spent dozens of hours picking away at the various plot threads and chasing upgrades. It\u2019s enjoyable, but as the hours wear on, my interest in the same sequence of chambers wore thin. I longed for a wrap-up, even as the game demanded more escape attempts. Even after \u201cwinning,\u201d that tease continues for hours more before a proper conclusion.The story is stretched across too many hours of play to maintain excitement throughout, but there\u2019s absolutely a rich bounty of content to uncover along the way. Hades is a massive game, with a wealth of additional content to appease even the most hardcore of engagement. A \u201cgod mode\u201d offers a gradual increase in damage resistance after each death, putting victory in reach for even those with a cap on their skills. On the other hand, risk-takers looking for more rewards can eventually access a way to increase the difficulty. Alternate boss fights, new weapon aspects, hidden storylines, and plenty more invite the player to get lost in Hades\u2019 potential. These variants and additional options provide life to the game, long after the charm of standard completion attempts begins to wear out.\u00a0Even serious engagement doesn't ensure story completion\u00a0without many hours of investment, and only the most dedicated players will see the full spread of what Hades has to offer. But Supergiant\u2019s latest opus is a beautiful and thoughtful twist on Greek mythology, flipping these old stories on their head and transforming them into commentaries on modern relationships.\u00a0High-octane action gameplay may pull you into hell for the first time, but I suspect you\u2019ll stay to find out about this eccentric and fascinating family.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

And then I approach the desk of my father, Hades. I\u2019m not just some wayward soul trying to escape the underworld, after all, I\u2019m prince of the underworld: Zagreus. Hades has the gruff temperament of Kratos from God of War, acting as if I\u2019ll never do anything good enough for him. The more I talk to him, the more I think there\u2019s some kind of affection beneath his mean exterior, but it\u2019s rare that you ever hear it in his voice. As we chat, Zagreus himself has the smug air of a young adult committed to his goth attitude and aesthetic. Every comment from Zagreus to his father is sarcastic or accusatory. He\u2019s spent eons dealing with Hades, just as Hades has spent eons dealing with Zagreus. There\u2019s a shared history between these two characters, a mix of mistrust, love, exhaustion and frustration. Hades lives in that place of self-superiority, certain that his son will never understand the lengths he\u2019s gone through to be a father and lord of the Underworld. He doesn\u2019t seem to have the time or patience to deal with his son\u2019s rebellion any longer. In response, Zagreus exudes a real \u201cfuck you, old man\u201d attitude, but he\u2019s too cool to ever say it out loud, preferring a sarcastic nod and a biting comment to direct, verbal confrontation. Father and son always part ways with a dismissive laugh or frustrated sigh.Each time I come back from a run through the Underworld, I\u2019m able to have a new conversation with different characters inside Hades\u2019 house. Occasionally, I find Nectar out in the Underworld, which I can give to my friends as gifts, improving my relationship with my mentor Achilles, my step-mother Nyx, and a whole cast of characters \u2014 netting me new dialogue and trinkets to help with my escape plan. I enter my room to spend some currency I found on my last run \u2014 upgrading myself and increasing my chances at success \u2014 and move into the armory. I collect a trinket \u2014 gifts from my loved ones \u2014 talk to Skelly, my sentient practice dummy, and select a weapon from Hades\u2019 arsenal. Now wielding a spear, I jump back into Tartarus from my second story window and start climbing again.Hades is shown from a top-down perspective. I get to see Zagreus, and all my friends up close when they speak \u2014 thanks to beautiful character portraits \u2014 but most of the time I\u2019m a red blur dashing between enemies.As Zagreus, I have a deceptively simple combat arsenal. I have a basic attack, a special move, a dash, and a ranged attack called a Cast that fires a ranged barb that sticks into enemies for a brief time. And I have these attacks for each of my six weapons \u2014 but I can select only one weapon prior to each run.

The Daedalus Hammer is one of the most desirable upgrades in the game, dramatically  altering how my weapon works. For example, the special ability on the shield is a Captain America-type throw that bounces between a few targets before returning to me. The Daedalus Hammer increases the number of times my shield bounces between enemies. This may not sound exciting at first, but combined with powerful Boons, it could be the key to my escape attempt.The Daedalus Hammer is rare, and I\u2019m lucky to have more than two on any given run. Boons are far more common. These are upgrades passed to me by my uncles and cousins in Olympus. Zagreus has never met Ares, Poseidon, Zeus, Hera, or any of the others, but they all feel sympathy for him. He\u2019s a nice enough kid, and eager to meet his family, and they all know that his dad is the ultimate asshole in Greek myth. So these Boons imbue Zagreus with a fraction of the gods\u2019 powers, to help him on his journey \u2014 like handing your nephew a wad of cash before they go off to college and hoping they spend it on more than cigarettes and beer.These Boons offer me minor effects that impact various aspects of combat, usually focused on my attack, special, or Cast. If I pick up the Daedalus upgrade that lets my shield bounce, maybe I would want to find a Zeus Boon that causes my special to spawn lightning bolts on every enemy hit by my special attack? Or a Boon from Dionysus that transforms my Cast into a hazy pool that stuns and poisons targets inside, keeping them still for my shield to bounce.Every run I combine new effects like these together. More often than not, I smile at how absurdly powerful my Zagreus has become. But a good build isn\u2019t everything; I still need to survive my voyage through the Underworld. When I clear my first chamber, I\u2019m presented with a choice of doors. Each has different symbols on the outside, previewing the upgrade I\u2019ll get for completing that room. Do I want a boon from Athena? Or I could just get some gold to shop with? Charon, the boatman, has an underworld shop where I can buy health, Boons, and a variety of other items. No matter what I choose, I move forward. Eventually I reach the first boss, the Furies. This boss fight has a few different varieties, which can change things up between runs. But aside from a few, altered moves, it\u2019s a consistent experience. If I choose upgrades that focus Zagreus\u2019 power too much on clearing rooms filled with basic enemies, I may struggle on the boss fight. And if I focus too much on a boss-killing Zagreus build, I\u2019ll suffer on my way there. When I succeed, I get a brief moment to rest and heal before moving on to the next area of the underworld. Healing doesn\u2019t come easy in Hades, and I take every piece of food, healing fountain, or health bonus I can find. But my failure takes time. At first, I\u2019m sent back to the House of Hades when my health hits zero, but as I go, I gain the ability to revive myself multiple times each run. I see my losses coming rooms away, and more often than not, it\u2019s at the hands of the game\u2019s final boss, in the fourth level of the underworld. But even when I beat that boss and finish my journey, it\u2019s not over. The game tempts me with new materials to upgrade my weapons further and customize my home. But no matter how many runs I win or how many times I\u2019ve fallen, I\u2019m always jumping out that window again, just trying to see what that first upgrade will be, and then the next, and then the next. Hades has been a comfort game for me since it launched into early access in 2018, and it\u2019s especially been an excellent source of comfort over the past few days \u2014 something we\u2019re all in short supply of in 2020. I started my first journey through the Underworld in Hades two years ago. The game functioned basically the same as it does now. It was an excellent, fully functional game \u2014 albeit with only two bosses.

I'd been fighting to see this ending for hours (months, technically, if you count my time in early access), and in roguelikes, it feels better than usual to see an ending. But while I was definitely a little too proud of putting together a set of abilities and perks that shredded the boss after they wrecked me just a few tries ago, that wasn't why I felt tears welling up. I'd gotten so caught up in the story of my character, Zagreus, and the heroes, villains, and gods that had helped him get here that I was elated to have finally gotten him to the end of his journey. What sets Hades apart isn't just that it's a great roguelike with the kind of repeatable depth that makes it engrossing to play for hours, but also how it uses its structure to tell an ongoing story about family, secrets, and resolution.That Hades' narrative is so entwined with its combat is nothing new for the developers at Supergiant Games, who've established themselves as masters of putting your actions in sync with the stories they tell. In a roguelike such as Hades, it means playing as Zagreus, a god of rebirth. Tired of living under his father Hades' thumb and seeking answers about where he comes from, he sets out to escape to the world of the living, battling various undead monsters, living creatures, and mythological figures on his way out.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Hades ReviewYour godliness justifies the endless runs through the depths of the underworld, since dying and coming back to life is par for the course in Greek myth.

You chat with them, undertake side quests, and exchange gifts to deepen your relationships. Eventually, they become vital allies on your quest, even if they're not in the thick of combat with you.These interactions, as much as the precise combat, are the reason I kept coming back to Hades; while I was skeptical about how the roguelike structure would meld with Supergiant Games' focus on characters and stories, they've written and voiced reams of dialogue and lore, and almost all of it is delivered with vigor and is intriguing enough to pore over between your treks through hell.When you finally decide to take another stab at escaping, runs are broken up into a few different worlds, each made up of several randomly ordered chambers. Hades' combat builds on Bastion's tight, isometric fights and infuses them with the endlessly repeatable appeal of random buffs, modifiers, random enemy layouts, currencies, and progression that slowly turn the seemingly impossible task of reaching the surface into something manageable.Combat is quick and reactive, letting you chain attacks into dashes, dashes into special moves, and so on as you learn how to whittle enemy shields, avoid traps, and work over bosses. Each of the six weapons you can equip pushes you to play differently, and weapon-specific modifiers nudge you towards using different parts of your toolset; you might be comfortable poking enemies from afar with the Varatha spear, for example, but with a boon from Daedalus that triples the damage of your dash attack, you're going to want to close the distance and juke constantly. That, and how buffs interact in myriad surprising and effective ways, means I'm still not tired of making these runs, dozens of hours later. In more crowded fights, the Switch's smaller screen makes text and combat readability an issue, as these chambers are large enough to lose details (and runs). Other than that, though, combat is an outstanding mix of random variables and consistent action.And even as you're contemplating whether you want your spear to deal bonus critical damage or imbue your dash with a deflecting shield, tantalizing narrative threads seep through. Most buffs, called boons, are tied to individual gods; if you want that deflect, you're going to have to ask Athena for it, while Artemis is in charge of critical damage. These short exchanges give each god a distinct personality and reflect your actions and progress; you also occasionally catch clues about a potential side quest or plot thread that ties into the larger narrative. I liked Athena, Artemis, and Dionysus not just because their boons were consistently useful, but because I took to Athena's austere will, Artemis' prickly reclusiveness, and Dionysus' laid-back flirtiness.These conversations are more than narrative icing; you can give the gods gifts and build your relationships with them, too. Occasionally, you'll run into rooms where you can score two boons, but only after choosing one god and facing the wrath of the one you scorned as you fight off another round of enemies. Or, if you happen to end up with both that deflective dash and some critical damage, like I did, Athena and Artemis might have a quick chat with each other, then offer you a Duo boon that grants bonus critical damage to projectiles you deflect. As you progress through hell, you'll start seeing those boons used against you, which itself says something; for as much as the gods pay lip service to want to meet them on Olympus when offering boons, your journey to escape torment is little more than a spectacle to them, a game to watch and manipulate from the sidelines.Does that thread lead anywhere? It's hard to say because Hades unfurls so many other threads like this that tie its characters, your actions, and the world together into one cohesive, powerful whole that takes time to unravel. Eventually, you meet characters that sprinkle interesting bonuses into your runs while simultaneously launching new side stories back in the House of Hades, and even bosses change over the course of multiple runs. Supergiant has managed to turn the roguelike, a genre not usually known for riveting plots, into a compelling vehicle for storytelling.Supergiant has managed to turn the roguelike, a genre not usually known for riveting plots, into a compelling vehicle for storytelling.The random nature of the genre does mean the kind of climactic moments that define traditional stories are hard to come by, but I loved that. Rather than face an imposing boss, learning about a new twist of fate, and then moving on to the next act, you have hundreds of conversations with your family, roommates, and enemies about whatever comes to mind.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3971dd09-efcd-417f-9974-5500bb502241": {"__data__": {"id_": "3971dd09-efcd-417f-9974-5500bb502241", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea6014d9-6192-46e4-b274-ab7d70f3d726", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9feaa461a2a4097488cac9b6c49c1fb03c3d92e10689a81f563b157025f899a1"}, "3": {"node_id": "85a08d92-d22c-40ab-816a-cc70d289d839", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "81df9c9c7fb6708ca03760421ca4a90333fbab9393470dc40cb806be5d6666f0"}}, "hash": "2416e06c3a4d5c10209563936b6d6e22691adde328af90420269551965fb0e65", "text": "This is where Hades' bid to tell its story differently pays off, as playing it eventually feels like living in a crowded home for months, one where arcs happen, but nothing truly \"ends.\" It's the kind of story that makes small moments more significant. After being chided by Hades with a dismissive \"Back again?\" having failed to kill a boss, then listening to everyone around simply wring their hands about the lord of the dead, I understood why Zagreus would want to leave the shadow of his overbearing, distant father. That convergence between player and character motivation is a powerful feeling, and it's what Supergiant delivers so brilliantly.That long-tail approach to worldbuilding may not work for everyone; before I played Hades, I didn't see myself as someone who'd continue to play a roguelike after beating it. But I wanted to keep learning more about these characters and this underworld enough to keep coming back. That, along with a robust postgame that alters every weapon and boss, lets you make the game even harder for more rewards, and offers even more reasons to play an already entrancing mix of RPG and action combat, has absolutely hooked me. When I'm not playing Hades, I'm thinking about how cool it'd be to build the Exagryph machine gun with lighting boons combo that got me that first victorious run, but also throw some critical damage on top of that.I'm also thinking about how much I still have left to learn about Hades, both the character and the game, even dozens of hours in. Like in the Greek myths Hades takes inspiration from, endings aren't tidy, and they're almost never final. They're protracted, often unsatisfying, and are hard to find real closure in, and the fact that Hades understands this is its greatest strength. I'm sure there's a point where, after running through hell enough times, I'll have seen all Hades has to offer, both in its clever and endless fights and its many alluring characters, intimate moments, and rewarding quests. The story does end. But what matters so much more are all the moments between the start and end of a story, and the people who help us see those climactic moments but also stick with us between them. They're the reason we keep trying, and the reason we keep coming back.Hades is every bit the challenging and heartfelt journey that it's been on Nintendo Switch and PC, with the release on Xbox Series S|X, PS5, Xbox One, and PS4 providing more options for how to play one of 2020's best games. If you are returning from several hours on another platform, you might be disappointed that Hades doesn't support the same cross-save functionality that it does between PC and Nintendo Switch. So, whether you're a new player or a veteran, you will be starting your escape from the underworld from scratch.What is noticeably better with this release, especially if you've only played the Nintendo Switch version, is the overall clarity of the action. Hades on the Nintendo Switch ran beautifully but suffered from small text issues when played in handheld mode and looked quite soft when docked to a much larger display, such as a 4K TV. With Hades on current-generation consoles, 4K is the target, bringing a new layer of crispness and clarity to both the action and all the biomes it takes place in. The frame rate is rock solid too, never wavering from its 60fps target in a noticeable way. Combat sings with this fluidity, with the added definition letting you make out every detail, whether it's an enemy's attack or the bubbling lava of Asphodel.Loading times were never slow on other platforms, but especially when compared to the Nintendo Switch these new SSD-powered consoles make transitions between areas and runs overall feel a little zippier than before. These are small improvements that you might only notice if you've already sunk numerous hours into Hades on another platform, but they create a strong foundation for its debut on new hardware. Hades is the same brilliant rougelite that it was last year, but now with even more places to enjoy it than before. -- Alessandro BarbosaUse your keyboard!Log in to comment\nKotaku, Hades is my game of the year.

If you haven\u2019t finished the game\u2014and I mean really finished it\u2014and wish to avoid spoilers, probably skip those sections.)As other writers have observed, Hades, which entered early access in 2018 and recently launched its 1.0 version after almost two years of additional development, is about being trapped inside a house\u2014the house of your crappy dad, Hades, specifically\u2014and coming to terms with the fact that you cannot leave. More than that, it is a game whose structure and story are both rooted in repeated, inescapable failure. As Zagreus, the son of Hades, you try to slash, shield bash, spear, bow, punch, and gun your way out of hell, but no matter how many demonic shades fall after (ode to a Grecian) earning your ire, you end up back where you started.2020, in case you yourself are a celestial being who exists outside of time, has been a year of constant setbacks. It began with a horribly mismanaged pandemic that\u2019s claimed over 200,000 lives in America alone. Now each passing moment brings fresh tragedy or injustice. Every day, we learn of yet another failed effort on the part of good people to so much as toss a wrench into the gears of an endless number of greedy, uncaring machines\u2014many of which have been running in some form or fashion since before any of us were ever born. We get sick. We lose our jobs. Or some combination of the resulting tension and time/distance strain the small handful of relationships we value most. As the year comes to a close, it feels like even precious patches of gained ground are slipping into the abyss. It\u2019s become hard to focus, hard to see a point in fighting, or even just keeping up the mundane pretenses of daily life, in the face of an unabating slide into mask-off despotism.Hades is a game about what people do once they\u2019ve realized that failure is inevitable. How do you spend your time when you live in a house built on a foundation of a failure, when all you and those around you can do is fail, when failure will come whether you act or choose to do nothing at all? Sure, the people in Hades\u2019 case are Greek gods, but Greek gods are just people with better muscles and (slightly) worse decision-making skills when they\u2019re horny.Supergiant describes Hades as a roguelike, but only because there\u2019s not really a good genre descriptor that sums up what it really is. In between action-based runs through the ever-shifting halls of Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium, and the Temple of Styx, you spend ample time talking to various gods, goddesses, shades (ghosts, basically), and Dusa, who defies categorization. Also Cerberus, who is both bigger than all other dogs and has three heads, thus making him quantifiably the best boy. You can give these characters gifts to strengthen your bonds, but just conversing with them over the course of countless runs is enough to peel back many of their layers.You get to know these characters as 10 hours give way to 20, 30, 60, and onward. When I first encountered Achilles while playing Hades\u2019 early access version over the summer, I thought he was a dreary shadow perpetually posed against the same dull wall. Now, months later, he\u2019s like a father, brother, and maybe more to me\u2014a font of generosity in spite of his own past failures. These slow-build interactions, which sometimes move at a speed akin to that of real-life relationships, are just as central to Hades as making a mess of Hell on your way to the surface. Characters, in turn, react to your progress and deeds, some of which come to directly involve them. Given the number of possible permutations of your progress both through the game and with various characters, it is a mind-bogglingly complex narrative system that somehow manages to feel coherent at almost all times.You can also go fishing. And renovate your house!These relationships mean that Hades\u2019 goals are fundamentally different from those of other roguelikes, many of which prioritize difficulty and mastery above all else. Hades builds upon that foundation, but despite a focus on failure, the game isn\u2019t actually about the player beating their head against a series of brick walls until they finally break through. Now that many of my friends have started playing Hades, I\u2019ve heard a few of them express frustration about particular bosses or their struggles in certain areas.

Each run yields some form of tangible progress, both in terms of character dialogue and items that can be used to permanently boost your stats, making you better able to withstand whatever challenges you face. Fights also do a subtly sublime job of preparing you for future fights; enemies and bosses call forward to each other. You might stroll into the gargantuan Bone Hydra\u2019s lava lair for the first time and think \u201cOh god, I\u2019m about to get my ass kicked,\u201d but you\u2019re never actually in over your head. Even if you\u2019re having trouble making bone-heads or bone-tails of its attack patterns, you\u2019ll eventually gain enough HP and death defiances (think \u201clives\u201d in classic games) that you\u2019ll have ample room for error. If that\u2019s not enough, you can also toggle on \u201cGod Mode,\u201d which gives a slight, steadily increasing boost to your damage resistance after each failed run. It makes narrative sense\u2014you\u2019re a friggin\u2019 god, after all\u2014and it doesn\u2019t lock you out of anything.But even if you rough it, like I did, you\u2019ll likely become powerful and savvy enough that you\u2019ll eventually gain the presence of mind to start working your creative muscles. Each Hades run is full of randomized powerups and \u201cboons\u201d from various gods and goddesses that imbue Zagreus with additional powerful abilities but only last until you die. To give just a small handful of examples: Athena can put a shield around your default dash ability, allowing you to slam enemies\u2019 projectile attacks back into them. Ares can add \u201cDoom\u201d to your regular or special attacks, which causes enemies to take a burst of damage after they\u2019ve been hit (you can stack these bursts and add all kinds of fun modifiers to them, too). Artemis can boost your critical hit chance through the roof. Zeus adds lightning to abilities, because that is his main thing (aside from very bad horny decisions).I have yet to find many wrong choices here. There are definitely builds that will just melt bosses, but unlike in other roguelikes, I\u2019ve never felt the need to seek out guides or optimal builds to give myself a real chance at success. I developed my own play style over time, and it works for me, even if it sounds\u2014as I\u2019ve said previously\u2014heretical on paper. No matter which weapon I\u2019m wielding, I never stop dashing. I don\u2019t really use my special or cast attacks much. I focus my boon selection on raw damage and critical hit chance. I seek out Athena\u2019s shield with religious fervor. All of this transforms Zagreus into a sort of disco ball spam cannon, and it\u2019s a great time. I\u2019ve completed over 20 runs, many of them with the \u201cheat\u201d (a set of conditions players can activate to make Hades harder, in exchange for better rewards) turned up. My method, crude though it might be, works. But I\u2019ve also watched my partner, friends, and various Twitch streamers take other approaches that may or may not be equally effective, but are nonetheless viable, if not better.Hades presents the illusion of difficulty and a brutal learning curve, but it ensures that, no matter what, everybody will eventually get over the finish line. Its ever-changing labyrinth is a hall of mirrors, but not in a maliciously deceptive way. Rather, it intentionally seeks to invite players into a genre that, for some, has previously come across as alienating or daunting without removing any of the underlying substance. No matter how you play, you experience the tension of staring down imposing bosses, the thrill of accidentally assembling your dream build. You die a whole, whole lot, but you do it at your own pace.This brings us to Hades\u2019 central contradiction: It is a game about failure, but it\u2019s deeply concerned with your success.

Regardless of extenuating circumstances along the way\u2014and there are many\u2014this remains a constant.(Major spoilers begin here.)Pinched between the cruel fingers of The Fates, Hades\u2019 story becomes a tale about reframing failure. When what you really want remains just outside your grasp, what can you do? A whole lot, it turns out. While Zagreus\u2019 escape attempts never, say, save the world or change the course of Greek myth, each one slowly but surely improves the lives of those in his community. Initially, this is largely the byproduct of a self-serving approach: You clean up the lounge in the house of Hades so that you can exchange gems, won during runs, and other currencies for additional items and currencies that help improve subsequent runs. You give gifts to characters in exchange for \u201ckeepsakes\u201d that yield special bonus stats and abilities for as long as they\u2019re equipped. Other improvements follow, but they take on a decidedly less selfish, more personal bent. You help Orpheus, the dour but good-natured musician, rediscover his muse. You reconnect Achilles with his lost love. You get Megaera and her, uh, very different sisters back on speaking terms. You make a bunch of cosmetic improvements to the lounge that don\u2019t do jack for your escape attempts, but they make the life of Dusa the Gorgon, functionally an overworked housekeeper, easier. It takes a long, long, long time for Zagreus\u2019 relationships with his closest blood relatives to improve, but in the meantime, he creates meaningful bonds with his found family and makes his homeland a more livable place. Not only that, he reveals himself to be the kind of guy who\u2019ll just listen to random shades talk about how they died, helpfully bring fish to the lounge\u2019s chef, and even just quietly celebrate whoever most recently took home the title of lounge employee of the [incalculable amount of time because the future is also the present in Hell, sort of, it\u2019s hard to explain]. Zagreus never stops being a spoiled prince, but he comes to regard everyone around him, regardless of status, as people with their own wants, needs, and existences.Zagreus begins his journey trying to get the hell out of Hades. He seeks to escape, heedless of what that might mean for those he leaves behind. There\u2019s a sort of nihilism underpinning this: Sure, he has a very personal reason for departing, but he also sees the place itself as emblematic of his father\u2019s failure. It\u2019s beyond redemption, so why stay? Over time, though, his focus shifts. There is no big revelation, no on-the-nose \u201caha\u201d moment that heralds this change in his personal trajectory. He just sort of starts helping other characters and rebuilding a place that\u2019s fallen to pieces after eons of structural neglect, and even as his own situation reveals itself to be more and more dire, he ramps up his efforts. Other characters, in turn, go from being quietly insulted that he\u2019s leaving to openly pleased that he\u2019s staying and finally pitching in. By the time it becomes abundantly clear that Zagreus will never be able to leave Hades, you get the sense that he\u2019s made his peace with it. He\u2019s figured out what he can do, and though it\u2019s not as grandiose as his original plan, it might be more important.I began playing Hades near the beginning of this summer, when it was still in early access. The game\u2019s ending was fundamentally different back then, as it had been in various permutations since 2018. In the mid-2020 version of the game, you squared off with Hades and, if you sent him packing, Zagreus would try to proceed onward into Greece, only to suddenly be torn asunder by some unseen force as he crossed the threshold. \u201cIs there no escape?\u201d text at the top of the screen would ask.

As I did subsequent runs to see more character dialogue and unlock upgrades, Hades continually asked Zagreus why he even bothered; all that awaited him was an endless series of painful, pointless deaths. I spent probably 30 hours of game time with those stakes firmly in place. Zag would turn back the forces of hell, beat up his dickbag dad, and then die gruesomely as some invisible hand wrung him out like a dish towel. This put the hopelessness of the situation into stark focus. Zag was trapped in Hell in multiple senses: the physical location, sure, but also the pure misery that is doing something repeatedly in hopes of creating change, only to produce the same results every time.But this also forced the spotlight onto the tangible outcomes of Zagreus\u2019 actions. Despite his deaths, the lives of those around him improved. The house of Hades did, too. I chose to make those improvements because I didn\u2019t have much else to do with the resources I was amassing. But it felt good. It felt like an extension of who Zagreus had become while stuck in the blades of this nightmarish blender. The system Zagreus found himself trapped in was hopeless, but the situation was not. Life was not. It was an extremely powerful statement delivered through a combination of mechanics, narrative, and an incomplete game.I kinda wish that was still the ending. But due to the fickle nature of early access, that version of Hades no longer exists. A large chunk of the game I played is not the game people are playing now, but that portion indelibly colored my experience. The game I played told a different story that, intentionally or not, made a different point. Until, as of the full 1.0 release, it didn\u2019t.In both early access and the 1.0 release, in addition to escaping from Hades, Zagreus also wants to find his long-lost mother, Olympian goddess Persephone. He didn\u2019t even learn she was his mother until adulthood, long after she\u2019d both secretly moved to and eventually fled the underworld. In the version of the game where Zagreus\u2019 goal was unattainable, this didn\u2019t matter all that much. It could have been anything else, but due to the structure of the game at the time, it would not have impacted what, in its absence, ended up feeling to me like the point of the story.In the 1.0 version of the game, after you defeat Hades, Zagreus leaves the confines of hell and finds Persephone. After a brief bit of long-overdue mother-son bonding, Zagreus becomes weak and dies. It turns out he can\u2019t survive topside for long. The game then turns into a series of jaunts to the surface (assuming you\u2019re able to defeat Hades each time) wherein Zagreus frantically scrambles to learn bits and pieces about why his mom left, what Hades stood to gain by hiding it from him, and how to get his mom to return to the underworld. I read most of these conversations as a doomed effort. Persephone had regrets, sure, but she liked the life and home she\u2019d built for herself and did not seem to be in a hurry to get reacquainted with the lord of the dead. That was fine with me. My parents are divorced; when I was a kid, I wished more than anything that they\u2019d get back together. In reality, they\u2019d already stayed together longer than they should have for my sister and me, and it made them both miserable.In Hades\u2019 release version, Persephone ends up returning with Zagreus to the underworld after you defeat Hades 10 times. The two of you hop into a small boat captained by Styx boatman-turned-item-salesman Charon, and the credits roll. It\u2019s a nice moment. Then, in a post-credits scene, Persephone forces Hades to more or less own up to his bullshit. It all feels a little too tidy. Years of verbal and physical abuse, a colossal web of lies, a stoic belief that Hades knew best that ended up pushing everybody he cared about away, and leadership that caused a kingdom to crumble, and all his own son gets is a quick \u201cOh dip, my B\u201d? Admittedly, it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, and Zag does hold Hades accountable for most of his wrongdoings.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "baf820f8-533a-4a6c-a3d3-d4acec586975": {"__data__": {"id_": "baf820f8-533a-4a6c-a3d3-d4acec586975", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6c8de31-ef5e-494a-94bb-7d7b75c14a5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce007e2b22e45cccf44de0bbaa5a4035bd8de2d2337c7e48c671c517d6776236"}, "3": {"node_id": "48619bb4-3041-474b-9828-13d057f6eb8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ac9a918815669c0c368797a37a87b976355b3ec5ef4f8892ada953f9ab0c0d2"}}, "hash": "4a5c6bd8f3e60d33f45d1052241df2a3054add163038cdbecfb7193fb402614f", "text": "But when I first watched the scene play out, it still didn\u2019t feel true to the otherwise nuanced nature of the game. Plus, questions remained unanswered: How would the other Olympian gods react to the illicit presence of one of their own in Hell? They\u2019d waged earthshaking wars for less, after all.This ending was, to me, a grand anticlimax. Fortunately, Hades was not over. After beating Hades, you haven\u2019t beaten Hades. After beating Hades 10 times, convincing Persephone to come home, and watching the credits roll, you haven\u2019t beaten Hades. Even after the credits, the game goes on for hours and hours. While some players, myself included, have reached Hades\u2019 final scene, they still haven\u2019t puzzled out exactly what number of runs or other preconditions trigger it. But as with everything else in the game, it seems to be inevitable. You just have to keep making runs and talking to characters, who react to the sudden return of their queen. You just have to stick with it.(Major spoilers end here.)I cannot evaluate Hades without factoring in the period of time in which I played it. This is true for basically all games: How many classics have you spent years nostalgically pining for, only to realize upon finally replaying them that you were actually longing for a simpler time or circumstance? But I think this holds especially true for my read on Hades, both in terms of what resonated and what left me feeling a little conflicted.I first started playing Hades around the same time Black Lives Matter protests erupted across the nation. It feels like an eternity ago, at least in terms of the sense of possibility that gripped The Discourse at the time. It felt like people were really waking up to the bloody havoc police regularly wreak on Black people and the structural damage that communities endure so that police\u2019s coffers can remain overstuffed. Perhaps more importantly, it seemed like Americans were no longer writing off alternative ideas about how to improve communities. Activists have advocated for abolition and defunding for at least as long as militarized police forces have existed, but earlier this year, it briefly felt like the moment they\u2019d been fighting so hard for had finally arrived. Defunding became a mainstream talking point. It seemed like, perhaps, at least in Democratically-led cities, people could begin forcing fundamentally unjust systems into a shape that vaguely resembled justice.But, as we all know by now, things haven\u2019t worked out that way. As the months drew on, police abuse of protesters continued unabated as major media organizations fixated on property damage instead of human lives and the police\u2019s role in instigating violence. Far-right extremist militia members shot people and sought refuge among police ranks. Now we stand in the crosshairs of a Presidential election that seems poised to spark off even worse violence in the streets and potentially steal away whatever small semblance of democracy remains in this country.Hopelessness is in right now. How could it not be? People rose up, but the historically awful status quo rose higher. What is there left to do but go on Twitter and Facebook and post different variations of \u201cWe\u2019re fucked\u201d alongside whatever headline you read most recently? I\u2019m a white guy in no present danger beyond what I subject myself to. Despite this, I spent a lot of the summer despairing.I will not go so far as to say Hades got me through it. At this point in my life, I am skeptical of games\u2019 ability to do things of that magnitude. But as the summer wore on, Hades\u2019 story of somebody refusing to despair in the face of overwhelming systemic failure and instead pivoting into helping rebuild his community and support his found family took on a new significance. I watched people much smarter than me talk about how hopelessness is useless, good causes are gaining ground in smaller ways, and no matter where you live, there are vitally important grassroots organizations that anybody can contribute to\u2014people need only seek them out. I knew this logically, but that didn\u2019t reassure me much. Hades helped me feel it.In the coming months and years, things are likely to get worse. But in recent times, Hades has given me some darn good days, and much more importantly, it\u2019s helped me keep in mind that literally everybody is capable of giving somebody they\u2019re close to\u2014or just some rando, or a group of randos, or whatever\u2014a couple of good days. In time, that can and hopefully will coalesce into something larger. In the meantime, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got, and it\u2019s not nothing.(Major spoilers begin here.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48619bb4-3041-474b-9828-13d057f6eb8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "48619bb4-3041-474b-9828-13d057f6eb8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "baf820f8-533a-4a6c-a3d3-d4acec586975", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4a5c6bd8f3e60d33f45d1052241df2a3054add163038cdbecfb7193fb402614f"}, "3": {"node_id": "baab585d-6f06-4a3a-bb90-51385e6aaaea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ca5c54d3d73bc1294ef7746e74f6398f7a910d1f0c8d9ef65762156cd6d4b65"}}, "hash": "7ac9a918815669c0c368797a37a87b976355b3ec5ef4f8892ada953f9ab0c0d2", "text": "(Major spoilers begin here.)While sticking with Hades for what I thought was going to be an additional day but turned out to be an additional week of late-night \u201cjust one more run\u201d sessions, I found the game\u2019s epilogue\u2014which unfolded in the same format as the regular game\u2014to be much more complicated than its too-neat ending. During or after runs, Zagreus and Hades would regularly jaw back and forth about their broken relationship\u2014both engaging, finally, in something resembling good faith, but with Hades continuing to insist that his actions were partially justified and his abusive habits were immutable. Meanwhile, Zagreus and Persephone tried to build a relationship, but it was clear that they had a lot of lost time to make up for.Still, when the game finally \u201cended,\u201d it wrapped up with an optimistic but messy message about family, which you\u2019d expect from a game starring famously dysfunctional Greek gods. By this point, Zagreus\u2019 role within the house of Hades had also changed. Instead of trying to actually break out, he\u2019d become an official staff member tasked with testing Hell\u2019s defenses and keeping up appearances so that no nosy Olympian gods would come a-knocking. He\u2019d more or less been assimilated into the broken system. He\u2019d gained a seat at the table, but the status quo endured.It left me wondering if a game that needs you to be able to run through it infinitely could ever actually be about dismantling a structure, rather than reifying it. But Hades is a gargantuan game about many things. I can\u2019t knock it too much for veering off course at the end, especially when what resonated most with me probably wasn\u2019t even the final destination to begin with. Hades isn\u2019t just a game about failure. It\u2019s also about family, sacrifice, the lies people tell themselves, and a whole host of other subjects. It takes source material that is often quite dark and a central narrative that is very grim and comes out with something that is remarkably lighthearted. It\u2019s a heck of a balancing act, but Hades pulls it off. Supergiant has managed, against all odds, to craft a Greek mythological tale that gives most characters a happy ending.(Major spoilers end here.)I\u2019ve come to appreciate that optimism, especially now that I\u2019ve gotten to watch many other people experience this fundamentally more hopeful version of the game than the one I first played. Hades and its cast of hot gods are giving players a much-needed reprieve from everything else. This dovetails nicely with the game\u2019s own mechanical kindness; like Thanatos, the god of death who expresses his affection by giving you health-increasing hearts, Hades acts all distant and difficult at first, but it really just wants you to have everything your heart desires. It wants to help you achieve your goals at a pace that suits you.\"After deliberating briefly, Cerberus concludes that, yes, he shall accept the sack.\"Narrative-driven bad dad puncher.A multifaceted story that unfolds based on how you play, sublime combat that rewards experimentation, challenges that are only as difficult as you want them to be, all the good feelings of roguelikes without a lot of the hassle.Some late-game story stuff, other roguelikes are probably ruined for me now.Supergiant GamesPC (Played), Nintendo SwitchDecember 16, 2018 (early access), September 17, 2020 (version 1.0)90 hours of the PC version (50 or so while the game was in its final stages of early access)Yesterday, I tweeted about how it\u2019s fun to watch people edge up against completing a run for the first time\u2014saying they\u2019re about to \u201cbeat\u201d Hades\u2014because they have no idea what they\u2019re in for.

Hades unfurls itself in what could be an infinite number of different configurations based on how you play\u2014or, if we take early access into account, even when you played.It is so large and generous that it\u2019s going to leave many different people with many different takeaways based on which characters and ideas they latch onto first or last or in the middle.

It says plenty no matter how you slice it. But a good story is in the telling, and Hades tells its story a little differently to everybody. It\u2019s like a good myth, in that regard. Or a hydra, in that it has a lot of heads, but nobody can quite agree on exactly how many.In Hades, one of Greek myth\u2019s most famous characters, the boulder-pushing Sisyphus, has a bit part. When he\u2019s not eternally rolling a rock up a hill, he doles out items in the game\u2019s first area, Tartarus. Despite his arduous, backbreaking lot in un-life, he comes across as blissfully cheerful\u2014a ray of sunshine in the dank depths of Hades\u2019 deepest chambers. Some players have observed that this is similar to a rumination on the character by philosopher and author Albert Camus, who in 1942 famously wrote that \u201cone must imagine Sisyphus happy,\u201d basically saying that if Sisyphus accepted the futility of his struggle\u2014or at least, its lack of an inherent meaning or goal\u2014he could find contentedness within it.In a Reddit AMA last week, Hades writer and designer Greg Kasavin said that this was not a deliberate nod, but added that it\u2019s \u201cpretty cool\u201d that he and Camus arrived at similar conclusions. To me, this particular riff on Sisyphus naturally arises not just from the reality of his situation, but also, in Hades\u2019 case, Zagreus\u2019 story. Sisyphus serves as a sort of reflection, a microcosm of Zagreus\u2019 own Sisyphean struggle and the contentedness he can find in accepting that, for the time being, he may not be able to break free from the hell that confines and defines his whole world, but he can still at the very least make small but meaningful improvements to the lives of those around him.The work never ends.

Once there\u2019s an opening to attack, Zag has three move types at his disposal, along with a devastating \u201cCall\u201d function that is unlocked after a few runs.The randomized Boons largely dictate which moves you\u2019ll be using. While one run might see the player spamming Special attacks for the entire session, another might push Zag down a path of switching between Attack and Cast. For the most part, there is enough flexibility in the Boon choices to keep players feeling lethal, but you can sometimes be forced to use a less exciting build. This provides its own unique challenge but can make that particular run less fun. (Of course, you can always just hit \u201cGive up\u201d and try again.)Occurrences of a \u201cbad build\u201d are very rare, however, with Zag often enhanced beyond belief into an overpowered underworld-shattering specimen. Whether it\u2019s from the lightning-charged buffs that Zeus provides or the \u201cDrunk\u201d status effects allowed by Dionysus, or any of the many gods in between, there\u2019s always an exciting upgrade around the corner.In addition to Boons, Zag can find other items like coins, Centaur Hearts, Daedalus\u2019 Hammers, and Pom of Powers to enjoy per-run buffs. These allow for more choices and enhancements to make each run more unique. What\u2019s more, upon death Zag doesn\u2019t totally reset. Permanent upgrades can be purchased using the Darkness currency, as well as Gemstones and an Ambrosia treat.It\u2019s these permanent upgrades that will be a key focus in the early game, as Zagreus is likely to fall at the first boss. The next time around, he\u2019ll have a better grasp on combat, additional health, and a new weapon. It\u2019s the progression over the time that remains addicting, without becoming repetitive. Even after 100 hours, players will still be uncovering new ways to play and equipment combinations.The speed at which you can rise through the depths of hell also helps avoid the feeling of repetition. Though areas may become familiar, their layouts and enemy types are randomized. What took 20 minutes before may only take five with Zag\u2019s new upgrades. Chasing Boons for your \u201cultimate build\u201d powers an addiction that will have you replaying over and over again in the same session.Though the PC version can run at higher resolutions and frame-rates, it\u2019s the Nintendo Switch edition that I\u2019ve spent the most time with. It\u2019s easy to put in a 30-minute session during a break, knowing that you\u2019re going to kill hundreds of enemies and fight a bunch of bosses in quick succession, with no busywork to hold you back. Though you can sink in hundreds of hours,\u00a0Hades\u00a0still respects the player\u2019s time.Provided you can handle the fast-paced combat that Hades\u00a0throws at you, which can be a little stressful, this game is a must-play. Whether it\u2019s on PC or Nintendo Switch,\u00a0this title runs incredibly smoothly with god-tier responsiveness in controls. It\u2019s Supergiant Games\u2019 best title yet, which is saying something as I loved\u00a0Bastion, and a serious Game of the Year 2020 contender.Hades\u00a0takes the hated cycle of retrying the same checkpoint over and over again, flips it on its head with rewarding progression, and makes the player genuinely look forward to starting anew. There really is nothing like it with this level of polish and execution. Gods, it\u2019s impressive!Hades was reviewed on PC (Ryzen 7 3700X, 32 GB RAM, RTX 2070) and Nintendo Switch with code provided by the publisher.Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

I keep trying to get Hades \u201cout of my system,\u201d but it\u2019s unshakable. This is the culmination of everything Supergiant Games has been working toward.The secret sauce \u2013 aside from stellar action-RPG combat \u2013 is character-driven storytelling.As Zagreus, the defiant son of Hades, you\u2019ll make a mad dash through Tartarus, Asphodel, and Elysium with hopes of reaching Greece and gaining insight. Along the way \u2013 during runs and also back home at your \u201cbase\u201d of sorts \u2013 you\u2019ll converse with legendary mythological figures, all of whom are voiced and full of personality in thoughtful ways. Rather than tell a linear story, Hades is dished out through morsels of conversation that fit the context of a world in which death is an inevitable inconvenience.It\u2019s a perfectly-conceived setting for a roguelike, one that often feels alive by reacting to what you, the player, are up to \u2013 without coming across as artificial or \u201cgame-y.\u201d These character interactions are wonderful. Supergiant\u2019s carrot-on-a-stick story and repeatable game loop go hand in hand, and that takes the sting out of defeat. After mastering the default half-hour-or-so run, I feel motivated to keep playing, in large part, for more incremental story bits. At the same time, I\u2019m still loving the flexible combat system and I\u2019m pushing myself by toggling on some of the many endgame difficulty modifiers.There\u2019s a lot of minutia in the background initially, to the point where Hades\u2018 first few hours run the risk of overwhelming players who are (understandably) curious about permanent upgrades. Several meta currencies can be used to improve your odds of breaking out of the underworld, and if you fixate up front \u2013 if you\u2019re too concerned with \u201cwinning\u201d as early as possible \u2013 you\u2019ll be doing yourself a disservice.Win or lose, ultimately, you\u2019ll be pulled back to the House of Hades. Zagreus is stuck in an endless loop, but life goes on. At home, you\u2019ll run into bosses (even the Big Guy himself) that you potentially fought and slayed on your last run, with no hard feelings \u2013 chances are they\u2019ll have something interesting to say about it. You might chat up Achilles, pet Cerberus, or train with Skelly, and be on your way again.In other words, Hades rewards every attempt. The main narrative concerning Zagreus, Hades, and Persephone will start coming into focus as you continuously teach your old man a lesson, but the personal stories \u2013 including friendships and romances \u2013 can and will play out in spite of botched runs.What if you don\u2019t care to engage with that side of Hades outside of the bare minimum? The good news is that it\u2019s still a ridiculously fun, well-balanced action-RPG experience, and you won\u2019t be bogged down by dialogue. After 20 hours, I still enjoy beating up the most basic creeps. That says something.There are three full biomes, the first two of which are an eternal pleasure to burn through and the third of which sometimes has slight pacing issues depending on your build and how equipped you are to handle waves of enemies that need to be killed twice to truly die. A fourth zone, the Temple of Styx, serves as a smaller choose-your-own-adventure \u201ctime to stock up for the final boss\u201d buffer. It\u2019s all right.Within these biomes, you\u2019ll fight monsters or chat with friendly faces on a room-by-room basis rather than explore a continuous stretch of land.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6eda71f-ab76-4b6d-88c0-04e87f11636a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6eda71f-ab76-4b6d-88c0-04e87f11636a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a6f0389-35b9-49cd-adad-b79394e75dc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb631f297286041b6c9bb524c4d3c23f2ea04651bd79e8cac118122fe6e4060b"}, "3": {"node_id": "8da2a152-b781-4a2b-af8a-a207a3c6041a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c35ace1d0a606e91c2b2ced5e28230bf48cfa23911152a8484b4105b5a6ed7b9"}}, "hash": "f79bb9cb893168f661b354767f38d880e87ab3bd5b50f91e57e7f2d541979e5e", "text": "In most cases, there are two choices \u2013 you can pick which room to enter next and you\u2019ll plainly see what reward is going to be up for grabs (once you learn what each symbol means). Later, with an upgrade, you can even re-roll rewards if you don\u2019t like the selection.At first, I was expecting more of an exploration vibe from Hades \u2013 it\u2019s almost non-existent \u2013 but I grew to appreciate the straight-to-the-action structure. That makes it a joy to replay and grind for upgrades.Speaking of which, expect to die a lot until you\u2019ve made permanent purchases with the Mirror of Night in your bedroom. These unlocks can give you benefits like an extra dash, more longevity \u2013 including, at most, three \u201cextra lives\u201d on each run \u2013 and also boost your odds of seeing higher-tier boons pop up.Boons are frequently doled out as a reward for clearing rooms, and they\u2019re your chance to hear a message from the gods of Olympus, each of whom has a gameplay-specific area of expertise. Athena can help you deflect projectiles back at their source, Zeus has lightning chains, and Chaos will offer a range of powerful perks in exchange for a harsh temporary debuff. Boons are used to create and modify your build on the fly for the duration of your current run; they\u2019re my favorite part of Hades by far.Each boon can branch off in a few different initial directions, and those directions can further mix and match and be upgraded as your run progresses. I can\u2019t oversell how satisfying these abilities become. There\u2019s rarely a clear-cut best choice \u2013 everything has potential, and I never quite know where my character build will take me. I can\u2019t say the same for most other action-leaning roguelike games.Going a step further, every weapon \u2013 from the Eternal Spear to the Adamant Rail (gun) to the Shield of Chaos \u2013 has hidden \u201caspects\u201d that you can permanently unlock to specialize your playstyle. I\u2019m obsessed with the Heart-Seeking Bow and its ability to \u201ctag\u201d a target with my main arrow and then fire off a spread of homing shots from a safe distance. I love powering that up with assists from uncle Zeus.Zagreus also has a metered ability (based on the different gods) that you can charge up throughout battles and there are finite spell-like projectiles that you can \u201cstick\u201d in enemies, recover, and fire off again. Without breaking down every mechanic, let\u2019s just say combat is fluid, dynamic, and full of life.Discovering synergies just doesn\u2019t seem to get old. Effects stack up in delightfully powerful ways.For those of us who adore a capital-g Grind, this one delivers. Supergiant gives ample opportunities to accumulate meta currencies during dungeon runs, and you can even trade them (to get precisely what you need) back home. I was able to easily prioritize and work toward the specific unlocks I wanted.If anything bummed me out in Hades, I\u2019d probably point to unevenness in the latter two zones, which sometimes feel like I\u2019m going through the motions, and an arguable missed opportunity for a larger boss roster. Supergiant designed several genuinely memorable (and highly replayable) fights, but it leaned a bit too heavily on variants. They don\u2019t all shake things up as much as I would\u2019ve liked.At the same time, those criticisms stand out to me mostly because everything else is so excellent. If you\u2019ve enjoyed this studio\u2019s other games, for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d call Hades the best of the bunch. And if you\u2019re worried about hitting a brick wall and potentially missing the big-picture story moments, don\u2019t be afraid to turn on the \u201cGod Mode\u201d toggle for a guilt-free defensive boost to help you defeat dear dad.Hades had the unenviable task of bridging a well-established action-roguelike format with impactful character-driven storytelling, and neither element feels like an afterthought. They lift each other to new heights. The finer details \u2013 all those little artistic touches that add up over time \u2013 really seal the deal.It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone other than Supergiant pulling off this Herculean feat with such style.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

Login NowWe got our Greek on and went rampaging through the Underworld in Hades, but is this mythology-inspired roguelike truly godly or cursed by hubris?Hades was an altogether different kind of thing for Supergiant Games, who has, at this point, made a habit of exploring new spaces with each outing. The studio is no stranger to isometric and stylized games though, but where Pyre was a sort of sports story, Transister was RPG intensive, and Bastion was a action with a singular route, Hades is a shifting and contorting roguelike. Despite the nature of difficulty and randomness of these games, Supergiant has found a way to tell an engrossing narrative filled to the brim with good music, enjoyable progression, and vividly enjoyable depictions of the ancient Greek pantheon and its heroes and villains.No, it\u2019s true. Hades is a roguelike with a good story to tell. As Zagreus, son of Hades who was born and raised in the Underworld, you\u2019ve had enough of your life in the Halls of the Dead. And so Zagreus plots to escape. Hades doesn\u2019t exactly try to stop his son because he\u2019s a busy man with countless souls of the deceased to judge. Also, the Underworld is a shifting series of realms full of angry souls that will go out of their way to kill anyone who tries to leave. And if Zagreus dies\u2026 well, where is he going to go? Florida? Nope, he spawns right back in his old man\u2019s home to begin the journey again.What sets Hades apart immediately from other roguelikes like it is that death has context to push the story forward just a little bit each time. Your home base of sorts in Hades\u2019 home is filled to the brim with an expanding cast of characters that share unique conversation with Zagreus every time he returns. Among them are the Underworld lord Hades himself, three-headed-heck-guard-doggo-turned-best-boy Cerberus (yes, Cerberus has dialogue and will let you give him pets, the almost-immortal warrior and teacher Achilles, the motherly Nyx, and more. Everyone has something new to share with Zagreus if (when) he comes home.It\u2019s not confined to Hades\u2019 hall either. Out in the battlefields of Tartarus, Asphodel, and more, the other Greek gods of Olympus will send Zagreus messages and aid to empower him on his journey. He can also run into rooms where mythological figures like the boulder-rolling Sisyphus and the tragic nymph Eurydice await to speak with and aid him as well. Even the bosses in Hades are characters with ongoing narrative with the prince each time he meets them. And perhaps even more interesting is that the narrative with all of these characters can sometimes depend on whether you\u2019ve defeated them, been killed by them, brought a certain weapon with you, taken the aid of a certain deity, and more.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bdceff1-51df-4c38-b6c1-379a40bbe5fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bdceff1-51df-4c38-b6c1-379a40bbe5fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "8da2a152-b781-4a2b-af8a-a207a3c6041a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c35ace1d0a606e91c2b2ced5e28230bf48cfa23911152a8484b4105b5a6ed7b9"}, "3": {"node_id": "30853b2a-fc37-4ae2-94fb-b856f94d1f58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b511a40c1b088e7a37117858f8eb7dac6e20761a01e5a3113763d0b27e932cd"}}, "hash": "502dc29f4dea62e54deb1ba55644e94dd5c310f4c574c1d10c4712097782c929", "text": "It all comes together to make Hades one of the most story-rich roguelikes I have ever seen, and often satisfying even in my continuous bouts of dying and trying again.It has to be said that this is all set to Supergiant Games\u2019 arguably best soundtrack yet. Composer Darren Korb has put together an awesome arrangement of music that adapts to the players situation, feels mellow or chill when it needs to be, and hair-raising intense and dramatic when in the throes of a battle to the death. It moves back and forth between these situations well and also features some haunting lyrical melodies set to unique situations. Supergiant Games have always had good music and Hades\u2019 soundtrack is no exceptionStory-hefty nature aside, Hades is still functionally a roguelike. What that means is that you\u2019ll go through a randomized series of rooms on your way to a boss fight in a region before moving up to the next region. Each room has a different reward associated with it that you\u2019ll gain if you defeat its conditions (or its just a lucky room with no danger). These rewards will be seen in orbs over the doors leading to that room for you to strategically choose. They can be upgrades for your weapon, messages and aid from a certain god (called boons), upgrades for your godly boons, dark gems to boost Zagreus\u2019 stats, coins to spend at a shop run by Charon, and more.The boons and weapon upgrades are probably the most important. There are up to six different weapons you can unlock in the game, but you can only take one with you when you begin a run. Daedalus Hammers are the weapon upgrades and they offer you a choice of bonuses, such as making the Stygian Blade break armor faster with its regular attack or making the Aegis shield bounce between and hit targets when thrown before returning. Each weapon has a large list of upgrades that can come from the Daedalus Hammer to make it more versatile.Much like the Daedalus Hammer and the various weapons, each god found in your journey has a series of power-ups associated with them if you find their messages. For instance, Poseidon\u2019s boons can grant water powers that knock enemies away or increase your treasures where Athena\u2019s boons will grant defensive traits such as resistance to damage or reflecting attacks back at enemies.Each boon will be associated with your basic attack, special attack, projectile, or dash, or a passive that affects them all, and mix and matching the gods\u2019 abilities with those of your weapon upgrades makes for countless possibilities that can lead to easier conquests out of Hades\u2019 domain. I tended to enjoy the Aegis shield or Varatha spear with Ares\u2019 Doom boons, which cause enemies to take a burst of damage shortly after being attacked and marked, mixed with a projectile reflection dash from Athena, and a chained lightning projectile attack from Zeus. That said, there\u2019s also a degree of randomness to it, you take what you can get from the choices you\u2019re given, and there are a ton of viable combinations to explore.As a roguelike, many players should know there is a certain level of difficulty associated with a game like Hades. If you lose, you don\u2019t just go back to a checkpoint. You go back to the very start of the journey, meaning if you made it to the final boss (which can take about 30 to 50 minutes to do) and fall right at the finish line\u2026 tough luck, chump. Go back to the beginning. The advancing narrative as you go makes it easier to deal with, but it can still be frustrating to start all over again. At the same time, you get stronger constantly and the journey becomes naturally easier with enough runs. In this regard, Supergiant Games adds something that I highly appreciate and many other players will too: options to both soften and toughen the difficulty of the game.Hades has a God Mode that makes the game easier and a Hell Mode that makes the game harder. God Mode isn\u2019t what you might think from something like Doom. It doesn\u2019t make you invincible because then you would miss out on a lot of Hades\u2019 narrative. Instead, every time you die, the game adds a stack of damage resistance to Zagreus that makes enemy attacks hit a little less hard each time. Die enough, and they\u2019ll be barely scratching you where they once maimed you, making for an altogether easier run. God Mode can also be toggled off and on at any time through a normal save, allowing you to use it at your leisure.Conversely, Hell Mode makes use of the Pact of Punishment that can be gained after players defeat a run.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30853b2a-fc37-4ae2-94fb-b856f94d1f58": {"__data__": {"id_": "30853b2a-fc37-4ae2-94fb-b856f94d1f58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "4bdceff1-51df-4c38-b6c1-379a40bbe5fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "502dc29f4dea62e54deb1ba55644e94dd5c310f4c574c1d10c4712097782c929"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d1bc962-0afd-445d-a695-4437a5396d86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d84e5cefee9d5754a4d64052fa15f8753dee705c0f7833a5d7ccb74803a4df51"}}, "hash": "9b511a40c1b088e7a37117858f8eb7dac6e20761a01e5a3113763d0b27e932cd", "text": "In normal games, the Pact of Punishment can be used to set different conditions like enemies doing more damage, making more enemies appear, and raising the prices of Charon\u2019s shop, with the benefit of better rewards.

A Hell Mode save also disables the ability to activate God Mode, which is smart and cheeky. Where Pact of Punishment is cool as a new game plus, it\u2019s also cool that players looking for a challenge can go all-in with Hell Mode from the get-go.Hades is another banger from Supergiant Games. That\u2019s a fact. Throughout the entire journey there was little I could find to be mad at other than failing in my quest close to the finish line or getting a bad combination of power-ups that didn't work well together, but God Mode was there for me to soften the quest if I so desired. The game\u2019s performance slowed a bit in rooms where there were a lot of enemies at once, but otherwise it was buttery smooth throughout. The mix of boons and upgrades provides delightful flexibility, the advancing and adapting narrative upon dying or succeeding keeps things interesting throughout, and the soundtrack is something I will continue to listen to inside and outside the game for just how ridiculously good it is. Whether you\u2019re looking for a challenging action game or just want to enjoy a beautifully illustrated and orchestrated story, Hades might be my preferred recommendation for romps through Hell.This review was based on a digital Nintendo Switch copy provided by the publisher.

Or ten years. Or maybe all the years. If you haven\u2019t played it yet on PC or Nintendo Switch, you\u2019re in for a treat.The PS5 version of Supergiant Game\u2019s seminal roguelite is almost identical to the PC version. It runs at a buttery smooth 60fps, and sings in 4K. It\u2019s mix of colours and lighting is gorgeous, rendering the many realms of the Greek Underworld in vivid detail.It tells the tale of Zagreus, son of the titular Hades, through his multiple attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus. And it\u2019s a tale well-told, despite the roguelite setup. The Greek Pantheon are more than willing to help him ascend. From Zeus and Poseidon to Aphrodite, Athena and Ares, they all show up from time to time to offer boons.CHECK THIS OUT: Is Back 4 Blood the co-op zombie shooter we\u2019ve been waiting for?Each area is divided into rooms, and when you clear a room, you\u2019re rewarded. Sometimes that might be with coins to spend at Charon\u2019s shop, or Poms of Power to increase an equipped boon. You might receive a health bar extension, or shadow crystals to purchase permanent power-ups in Zagreus\u2019 bedroom. Sometimes, though, you\u2019ll invoke one of the Olympean deities. These colourful character not only bestow buffs and modifiers based on their creed, but also offer to answer the Call.While each modifier is a powerful bonus (Zeus, for example, will bestow your attacks with lightning damage), the Call allows you to briefly summon a deity to help you in a fight. They can be absolute lifesavers, especially during boss fights. There\u2019s a surprising heart to the writing here too, and the line delivery is bursting with personality. Particularly Zagreus, whose flat, deadpan tone is shamelessly compelling.Weapons and permanent buffs are unlocked with Cthonic Keys, also earned as rewards for clearing rooms. While you begin with Zagreus\u2019 trusty broadsword, you\u2019ll soon unlock a spear, shield, bow, and a handful of other weapons. Each begins with a base attack and special attack, but all can be upgraded and modified with the aforementioned boons.CHECK THIS OUT: Is Halo Still relevant in 2021?Now and then you\u2019ll find Nectar, which can be gifted to various NPCs in exchange for Keepsakes. These are equipped pre-run, or later between rooms, and offer benefits such as increased backstab damage or a starting bonus of cash to spend. There\u2019s so much to earn and unlock that you\u2019ll always feel like you\u2019re making progress, even when you die. And if you activate \u201cGod Mode\u201d in options, you\u2019ll receive a bonus to damage reduction when you fail a run, ensuring that it gets fractionally easier each time.Where Hades excels among other roguelites is in its sense of identity. It feels unique, and the world it builds feels real. Because the story continues even when you fail, there\u2019s a true sense that the world exists with or without your agency. Yes, you can spend jewels to upgrade and modify Hades\u2019 greathall, or add altars and resource nodes to runs, but it\u2019s not all about moving forward. Characters move around between runs, they have conversations that hint at hidden agendas, and freely impart wisdom to Zagreus.Hades is exceptional, and the more you play it, the more you love it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58b7979f-5bb3-4900-afe2-fd3048742d18": {"__data__": {"id_": "58b7979f-5bb3-4900-afe2-fd3048742d18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d1bc962-0afd-445d-a695-4437a5396d86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d84e5cefee9d5754a4d64052fa15f8753dee705c0f7833a5d7ccb74803a4df51"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b762ed4-2f89-44c6-b307-3a8ab23633e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3c154912247ce0da342ca3a1442c7f2f4ebb17bf2fef61a54b88f118311c88a"}}, "hash": "e05b003a19f2c6a372f04c4c7949628debc97b1dedd79c753b28be34afb0b51d", "text": "If there\u2019s a complaint to be made, it\u2019s that there\u2019s no new content in the PS5 version.

If you like rogue likes, you don\u2019t need to read much further.\u00a0 Hades is a near perfect example of this type of game.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone who enjoys this type of experience to turn away unsatisfied with Hades.You play as Zagreus the defiant son of Hades who wants out of the Underworld.For those who want a bit more, Hades is as described previously an action role playing game set within the constraints of a rogue-like formula.\u00a0 Like modern games in this genre there are plenty of persistent upgrades that\u2019ll keep you playing, but each run is one which you can \u201cbeat\u201d the game using the random power-ups and abilities that are thrown at you during said run.\u00a0 The persistent abilities and unlocks that you earn over time will make things a little easier.In Hades you play as Zagreus, the prince of the Underworld and the defiant son of Hades.\u00a0 His quest is to leave the underworld at the dismay of his father, in search of his mother Persephone.\u00a0 Along the way, Zagreus is aided by the Olympians who offer him powerful boons that allow him to fight through four levels of the underworld.\u00a0 Like other games by Supergiant, this is an isometric title.\u00a0 Each room that Zagreus clears offers him distinct benefits for doing so, whether that\u2019s power-ups from the Olympians, currency to purchase items to help, or persistent items that can be spent on upgrades that allow for Zagreus to grow stronger.\u00a0 Each level is end-capped by a powerful boss.\u00a0 Fighting your way to the surface is your goal and to do so you\u2019ll need to face four distinctly challenging levels and said bosses who roadblock that progress.\u00a0 Zagreus has a slew of unlockable weapons that he can use to take on this challenge.While it doesn\u2019t sound much different than many others rogue-like titles, Hades most certainly feels different when you dig in.\u00a0 Unlike many games of this type, Supergiant succeeds in presenting a compelling narrative and an interesting cast of characters.\u00a0 Something that is often missing in games of this type.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

quest.\u00a0 Build said relationships and you\u2019ll earn powerful keepsake items that help you on your quest.\u00a0 It\u2019s a tale that\u2019s masterfully told by Supergiant.\u00a0 The relationship between Zagreus and his father, the Olympians and the inhabitants of the underworld is one that shows a level of dysfunction that is hardly represented in the source material and lends a level of a relatability to the cast of characters.\u00a0 Never have we seen a rogue-like game with such a strong narrative base as we see with Hades.The compelling narrative of Hades is not often seen in other rogue-likesAnd it\u2019s backed up in the gameplay department as well.\u00a0 Hades is as enjoyable a dungeon crawler as any.\u00a0 While it may feel a bit mashy if you get lucky enough to build one of the game\u2019s many OP builds, for the most part the combat is both challenging and fun.\u00a0 Most rooms have branching paths which allow you to pick up different upgrades for your character so no run ever really feels the same.\u00a0 There are a number of Olympians that offer Boons to Zagreus and builds can go in any number of directions on any given run.\u00a0 That\u2019s part of the fun of Hades.\u00a0 It\u2019s a \u201cwhat will I get this time\u201d sort of game.\u00a0 There\u2019s plenty of games like this, but some of them just aren\u2019t that fun when you don\u2019t get decent weapons or abilities.\u00a0 With Hades, you can pick a weapon that you like at the start and then build around that weapon.\u00a0 Over the long haul you can unlock special power-ups for said weapons, and if you really dig into the game you can unlock hidden upgrades and attributes for each weapon by fostering your relationships with the cast of characters in this game.\u00a0 Hades is good built on good, built on good.\u00a0 From the core gameplay to the narrative, to the unlockables, modifiers and more\u2026 everything feels organically implemented for you to unlock and unfold.\u00a0 While most rogue-like titles have zero pacing, Hades has this incredible pace to the game that always feels like you\u2019re working towards something.\u00a0 And it\u2019s almost always more than a feeling.\u00a0 As you get stronger, you can\u2019t help but make it further and further on your journey.Supergiant has always been known for their incredible attention to the small details of their games and they\u2019ve haven\u2019t yet released a game yet that hasn\u2019t had both a rocking soundtrack and stellar voice cast.\u00a0 Hades is no different. Once again, the cast of characters who voice this dysfunctional underworld family are incredible and the music is once again a high point for the experience.\u00a0 The level design and art style make this world come to life in a way that you just haven\u2019t experienced in this Greek mythos before.\u00a0 The tales and the characters are familiar for any that have delved into Greek mythology, but the way that they are introduced to the player are in such a way that make the content feel fresh.\u00a0 Hades puts many games to shame, frankly.\u00a0 Big or small.\u00a0 There are just so many small details that are there simply to hammer home that artisanal feel.\u00a0 Hades feels like it was made with loving care for each and every aspect of it.Look, if you have Game Pass this should be the first thing you play the moment it releases.\u00a0 The amount of enjoyment that you\u2019re likely going to get out of it is going to cover at least a month of your subscription to the service.\u00a0 That said, Game Pass or not, Hades is a game that you just shouldn\u2019t miss.\u00a0 Whatever you like games for, graphics, gameplay, fun factor, it\u2019s got this all in spades with equally exceptional quality wherever you choose to play it. If Hades got past you last year for whatever reason, don\u2019t let it get by you again.\n\nAttack of the Fanboy / GAME REVIEWS / Hades Review\nGod is a Geek, September 17, 2020One of the main reasons Hades stands head and shoulders above many other roguelite action-RPGs is the progression system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44eda269-d307-40b8-9157-e3a17ef2fc55": {"__data__": {"id_": "44eda269-d307-40b8-9157-e3a17ef2fc55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b762ed4-2f89-44c6-b307-3a8ab23633e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b3c154912247ce0da342ca3a1442c7f2f4ebb17bf2fef61a54b88f118311c88a"}, "3": {"node_id": "34821d40-aad9-47a2-8ea1-983c950a1341", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2dee916ef015356457525e4496c0c0805f7043d9bfc05fd19bb77abb260b5321"}}, "hash": "40fdd1ac26d6ba469801890c0af87cf309593d6a7b026ef6a6f9b18dc2482e4a", "text": "Yes, it\u2019s a hard game \u2013 rage-inducingly so, at times \u2013 but it balances that with a constant sense of progression and achievement that newer, more modern roguelites overlook or deliberately ignore. Like Dead Cells, Hades rewards you for failure, encouraging you to go back for that one-more-try, because it might be the one that leads to you unlocking a new weapon or power up that makes the next run easier or, at least, different.It doesn\u2019t have the same variety of weaponry and gear as some of its peers, but Hades offers a unique weapon upgrade system that always feels worth pursuing but still resets with each run. Of course, it helps to be reviewing the 1.0 version of a title that has been in early access for several years. Hades has been consistently worked on, tweaked and refined by Supergiant Games, a developer who already had immense pedigree from the success of Transistor and Bastion, and the result is a title that may be easier to get to grips with, but is no less complex or challenging in the long run.Having proved a success on PC, Hades is finally moving over to the Nintendo Switch, a platform that seems almost custom built for titles like it. An isometric dungeon crawler, Hades casts you as Zagreus, the son of the titular god, as he attempts to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, where the rest of the Greek Pantheon awaits him. But it\u2019s not that simple, and reaching Olympus is the test for entry, as all the horrors of the Underworld stand in his path.An interesting, surprisingly intricate plot is weaved between repeated delves into the netherrrealm, and sees Zagreus uncover godly conspiracies and unravel a web of lies about his heritage. The other gods, Zeus, Poseidon, Artemis, Athena, Ares, Hermes and Dionysius make an appearance throughout each run, offering power-ups and boons that increase your stats and attack power, or add special elemental effects to your attacks. Each seems more than happy to help Zagreus ascend, but some have motives of their own.The story progresses even through your failures, with new story beats and interactions occurring even when you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re getting anywhere, and items you take out of the Dungeons, even on death, help to improve your fortunes in future runs. Some of them simply allow you to upgrade Hades\u2019 Palace with new furnishings, rooms and items that serve little purpose beyond the cosmetic.Each run is broken into a series of rooms filled with enemies to defeat. When everything is dead, you\u2019ll be presented with a door showing the rewards for the next room. For example, keys are used to unlock new weapons and buffs, Pomegranates (Poms) of Power boost a weapons skill, coins indicate a meeting with the ferryman Charon, who operates as a merchant. You can also earn HP increases and collect Darkness essence which is used as a currency to apply buffs between runs.If a door shows the symbol of a specific god, you can expect a bonus related to that god. For example, Ares increases melee damage or adds effects to those attacks, while Hermes increases attack speeds and your Dash moves. It\u2019s an interesting system that keeps your buffs and boosts consistent yet still randomised. Sometimes you\u2019ll need to choose between several gods, and the one you don\u2019t pick will take offence, offering fewer or less effective buffs next time.It sounds obvious but the combat is the star of the show in Hades. There\u2019s a variety of weapons to choose from, including the starting broadsword, a spear with a long reach, a bow, and a shield you can bash enemies with or throw. Each weapon had a primary and secondary attack that can be upgraded during the run, but which reset on death. You also have a dash move for evading danger, and a ranged attack that you can imbue with various properties like your weapons. Combat is fast and responsive, and feels as rewarding on the Switch as it does on PC. The final kill in a room will always hit in slow motion right before the reward appears with a pop! and it\u2019s insanely satisfying every time.With a mix of melee and ranged enemies, some that drop mines or throw bombs, others still that fire lasers or can jump across the map, you\u2019ll be forced to learn the intricacies of each weapon to survive. Thankfully Hades tends not to overly punish you for death. Not only are there buffs and items you can equip to grant second or even third lives, but you get plenty of chances to refill your HP or earn currencies for permanent improvements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34821d40-aad9-47a2-8ea1-983c950a1341": {"__data__": {"id_": "34821d40-aad9-47a2-8ea1-983c950a1341", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "44eda269-d307-40b8-9157-e3a17ef2fc55", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "40fdd1ac26d6ba469801890c0af87cf309593d6a7b026ef6a6f9b18dc2482e4a"}, "3": {"node_id": "635f9a02-f92b-444f-93b1-af4d130a91b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9151d390229dca52afe57b0e1174c5e37b9532ba7ba84ceb94e11794732d6030"}}, "hash": "2dee916ef015356457525e4496c0c0805f7043d9bfc05fd19bb77abb260b5321", "text": "And besides, Zagreus himself is just a joy to play as.His sharp wit and quick tongue have been honed by a lot of updates, and he has an answer or comment for every eventuality. When he crawls out of the mire at the start of each new run he\u2019ll complain about the enemy it boss that killed him or the area he died in, and he responds to power-ups or events in each dungeon with little asides and subtle quips. His demeanour is dry and somewhat aloof, but it\u2019s entertaining, and his relationships with the other gods \u2013 even the mysterious Chaos god who shows up now and then with double-edged gifts \u2013 are well written and often funny. Oh, and giving them gifts you find during your runs allows you to explore their individual stories, leading to special events specific to each God \u2013 as well as giving you a few extra items to equip for bonuses during subsequent escape attempts. Get really friendly and they\u2019ll let you summon them during fights for devastating damage.Characters you find in and out of the Dungeons can help too, giving you gear and services \u2013 and in exchange for gifts they may give you items to equip, all of which can also be upgraded. You\u2019ll only be able to equip one at a time though, so choose wisely. At a glance, Hades build system seems simple, but there\u2019s immense depth to it if you can survive long enough.The version on Switch is up to date with all the updates and additions on PC so far. With Version 1.0 launching on Steam and the Epic Store, there\u2019s a bunch of new stuff including a new Claw-class weapon and various tweaks to boss behaviour and, notably, the endgame. Having not spent a lot of time with Hades on PC it\u2019s hard to comment too much on the effect of these changes, but as a whole Version 1.0 of Hades is a fantastic experience on PC or Nintendo Switch.Add to this the incredible score, so subtle you won\u2019t even notice that you\u2019re nodding your head or tapping your feet while slashing monsters into pieces, and the gorgeous art style that almost feels \u201ctypically Supergiant\u201d and it\u2019s not hard to see why Hades is universally praised. The Nintendo Switch version is not noticeably downgraded when played handheld, but you can see it when the Switch is docked. It\u2019s not quite as sharp, and the framerate isn\u2019t quite as smooth, but really you lose nothing in the incredible gameplay.With cross save, players who usually play on PC can carry on their adventures on the Switch, which is a fantastic addition on top of everything else. If anything, it would be nice to have the option to increase text size or zoom the screen on the Switch, as the action can happen fast and it\u2019s not always easy to track in handheld.There\u2019s a wonderful lightheartedness to a lot of Hades that can, every now and then, take a darker turn. The atmosphere is on point, the music is excellent, and the gameplay itself is incredibly satisfying. For a roguelite it\u2019s surprisingly giving in terms of buffs, progression, and player aids, which will make it much more accessible for newcomers. While the Switch version doesn\u2019t utilise the touchscreen controls or offer anything \u201cnew\u201d that the PC version doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s still absolutely worth grabbing if you have the chance. Utterly addictive and endlessly playable, with a late game element that will keep you coming back for a very long time, Hades is simply one of the best and most likeable roguelites available on PC or Nintendo Switch.Superb combat\nGreat progression system\nLooks glorious\nSolid storySome frame rate stutters\nAction is a little hard to see in handheld modeHades is a fantastic experience regardless of platform.

Roguelikes have told decent stories in the past, but I didn\u2019t think the Supergiant style of storytelling would work well in a roguelike setting. Hades proved me wrong. Now that the game is out of early access and finally complete, Hades is one of Supergiant\u2019s best works.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "635f9a02-f92b-444f-93b1-af4d130a91b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "635f9a02-f92b-444f-93b1-af4d130a91b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "34821d40-aad9-47a2-8ea1-983c950a1341", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2dee916ef015356457525e4496c0c0805f7043d9bfc05fd19bb77abb260b5321"}, "3": {"node_id": "1daa7ffc-c14e-42e3-8204-2c5a6da1ab83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2bd6dac60fb78f6d4686ee32c7252e2be0b1527f92660c81f5a4732542742e51"}}, "hash": "9151d390229dca52afe57b0e1174c5e37b9532ba7ba84ceb94e11794732d6030", "text": "Not only do the roguelike elements keep the combat feeling fresh for dozens of hours, but they also tie into the narrative in surprising ways and make the story much more compelling as a result. Hades is one of the best roguelikes I\u2019ve played in a long time, and I can\u2019t wait to jump back in and see what else the game has in store.You play as Zagreus, Prince of the Underworld, who is hell-bent on running away from home to join the Gods on Mount Olympus. The only problem is that Zagreus\u2019 father, the titular Hades, does not approve of his escape, so he must fight his way through Hades\u2019 domain in order to get out. Hades is a dangerous place, so Zagreus faces death again and again, hoping to get lucky at least once. As you reach higher levels of Hades, you\u2019ll learn more about Zagreus and his relationship with his father and the other residents of the House of Hades. These character relationships and Zagreus\u2019 mysterious motivations are at the core of the game, which is odd for a roguelike. There is still plenty of action packed combat and randomized items to pursue, but Hades places equal emphasis on fleshing out its characters and world. Its heavy focus on story places Hades in a unique position within the genre, making it a refreshing change of pace right from the start.Supergiant\u2019s transition to the roguelike genre is more than just a gameplay change. The repetition and randomness that permeate the genre are used to tell Hades\u2019 story, and it makes this mythological tale all the more engaging. In Hades, death is a plot device. Zagreus is determined to escape the House of Hades no matter how many times his endeavors may kill him, and he reawakens in Hades\u2019 domain each time you fail a run. His numerous deaths start to wear on him and those around him, and death is one of the driving forces behind the game\u2019s story.The random items and bonuses you obtain during runs are also explained within the context of the story. The Gods of Mount Olympus see Zagreus as family and want to aid him on his quest, so they send all sorts of boons to the underworld to support him. These boons come with dialogue and story tidbits, which add an extra layer of uniqueness to the buffs they provide and make them feel like more than just numbers and percentages. Rather than having the gameplay and story exist on two separate planes, Hades\u2019 gameplay and story are interwoven to the benefit of both departments. Many were skeptical of Supergiant making a roguelike when this game was first announced, but now it is clear that Hades could not have been anything other than a roguelike.In Hades, death is a plot device.If you normally bounce off of roguelikes, then Hades could be the one you fall in love with. The disheartening defeats of those first few runs are offset by charming characters and a desire to see the story through to the end. In the beginning, failure comes frequently and death comes swiftly, but you don\u2019t feel as bad about it because you get to check back in with Achilles, Nyx, and the rest of the gang before you brave the depths of Tartarus once more. It\u2019s not just the friendly faces that keep you going, either. Hypnos will tease you regularly and your father Hades does not take kindly to your multiple escape attempts. It\u2019s the perfect blend of positive reinforcement and snide remarks that make you want to keep going on your seemingly futile quest. When you add new weapon unlocks and other upgrades on top of that, death transforms from a frustrating punishment to a promising opportunity to grow stronger. There are enough elements pulled from Supergiant\u2019s other games that if you\u2019re a fan of the developer, you should absolutely check this game out even if you\u2019re not into roguelikes.Combat is fast and frenetic. It starts out simple, but the basic hacking and slashing at the core of Hades actually has a surprising amount of depth. You have a dash, a light attack, a heavy special attack, and a ranged cast attack. What separates Hades from other action games like it is its focus on positioning. Attacks from behind deal bonus damage, and the amount of bonus damage increases as Zagreus grows stronger, further incentivizing you to use your dash to flank your foes. Knocking enemies into walls is another core aspect of Hades, and learning to incorporate this into your playstyle can greatly increase your damage output.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1daa7ffc-c14e-42e3-8204-2c5a6da1ab83": {"__data__": {"id_": "1daa7ffc-c14e-42e3-8204-2c5a6da1ab83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b0c0fb-cf6d-4303-94e0-42adb8fac771", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ba8007c2490b310786b65ff460962ba7e0104d0488c58ef3c3ba8a801ac0a95"}, "2": {"node_id": "635f9a02-f92b-444f-93b1-af4d130a91b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9151d390229dca52afe57b0e1174c5e37b9532ba7ba84ceb94e11794732d6030"}}, "hash": "2bd6dac60fb78f6d4686ee32c7252e2be0b1527f92660c81f5a4732542742e51", "text": "There are also traps scattered throughout the game\u2019s arenas, and while you\u2019ll accidentally stumble onto pressure plates and trigger spike traps all the time during your first few runs, you\u2019ll eventually learn to use them to your advantage, adding yet another layer onto an already complex combat system.What separates Hades from other action games like it is its focus on positioning.There are multiple weapons to learn and master, but most of the combat variety comes from the many different boons and items you can acquire during runs. Boons are acquired at a steady pace throughout a run, but the ones you get are random each time. Boons from each God are centered around different things, and you\u2019ll quickly learn which Gods fit your playstyle and which you\u2019ll want to avoid. Zeus\u2019 boons cause your attacks to chain lightning to nearby foes, for example, while Artemis\u2019 boons focus more on critical damage. Mixing and matching different boons can result in some borderline broken builds. I was able to get through the entire second area and most of the third area on one of my earlier runs just because I had a ridiculous set of boons and upgrades. Each run in Hades feels very different from the last.On PC, the game\u2019s beautiful art style really shines. The game doesn\u2019t take much power to run and is incredibly optimized, so you can easily bump up the resolution and framerate if you have a fancy display. At both high resolutions and high framerates, Hades is absolutely stunning. The hand-drawn backgrounds and character portraits are gorgeous and the game never fails to be a joy to look at. On Nintendo Switch, the game holds close to it\u2019s 60 FPS target at native resolution, but will slow down during effect heavy battles with multiple enemies. It never becomes unplayable, but it can make death during those rare moments feel cheap. A little more work can be done, but like Dead Cells at launch, the performance on Switch is not enough to completely detract from an otherwise outstanding experience.Hades is an excellent roguelike that appeals to both fans of the genre and newcomers alike. Roguelike veterans will appreciate the combat\u2019s breakneck pace and the replayability offered by the randomized boons and items, while newcomers will have several charming characters and an interesting story to keep them going between runs. Of course, it\u2019s difficult to tell if the game has staying power this soon after launch. Only time will tell if Hades joins the pantheon of roguelike greats alongside The Binding of Isaac and Dead Cells, but it makes an incredibly strong impression. Hades succeeds as both a narrative-driven adventure and an addicting roguelike, and that\u2019s a pretty tough combination to pull off.\n- This article was updated on September 17th, 2020 \nCurrently serving as an Associate Editor at Attack of the Fanboy, Diego Perez has been writing about video games since 2018, specializing in live service games like Destiny and Final Fantasy XIV.
