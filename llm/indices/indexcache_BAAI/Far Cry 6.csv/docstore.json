It cast likeable jock douche Jason Brody as a fish out of water, learning to survive in the jungles and beaches of the Rook Islands. Underskilled, outnumbered and stranded on a strange lump of rock and moss with the psychotic Vaas hot on your heels,  it always felt like you were one tiny step away from tragedy and an untimely death. More recent Far Cry's have progressively steered away from 3's set-up, making each protagonist more and more of a one-person war machine - it's less about survival of the individual and more about the survival of a revolution. With Far Cry 6, we see the culmination of that ideology - Ubisoft boasts that on Yara, you'll be made to feel like a single Guerilla fighter taking up the space of an entire army. Dani Rojas is ex-military, instantly proficient in all weapons and vehicles, and a natural, but reluctant leader. They were made for this.The developers at Ubisoft want you to feel powerful, they want you to feel like a badass, and so they've leaned into the chaos, the explosions and the epic, wacky battles. As a result, as an open world sandbox, Far Cry 6 is a lot of fun. An unfortunate side effect of that, however, is that where story is concerned, Far Cry 6 has lost a lot of the tension of previous games.You're no longer a Jason Brody, finding your way, learning your skills and simply fighting to live. You're now a T-1000 striding through Yara, firing rockets from your nuclear backpack whilst conjuring an almost unlimited arsenal of weaponry out of thin air. Dani always has a quip, is never under pressure and always knows exactly what to do. Which is fine when you're out mowing down your 20th soldado outpost in a row armed only with a solid gold grenade launcher and the help of your pet crocodile Guapo, but not all that interesting when it comes to investing in Far Cry 6's story.Luckily though, the open world fun of Far Cry 6 is as good as it ever was. Yara is both enormous and absolutely beautiful, featuring some of the most incredible vistas you're likely to find in any video game this year. Exploring feels intimidating and overwhelming at first, with so much out there to uncover - and after a small tutorial island the game lets you go pretty much wherever you want - though once you strike out you'll quickly find it's all more or less the same fare as other Far Cry games. There are checkpoints to clear, hostages to rescue from the side of the road, collectibles to hunt down and cross off your lengthy list - mechanically, the framework here is almost identical. Depending on who you are, this might come as either reassurance or a disappointment. Many players love that familiar Far Cry grind - while some may have been hoping for a shake up to that formula.Front and centre of any and all marketing for Far Cry 6 has been its much touted villain Anton Castillo, played by consummate bad guy Giancarlo Esposito, and it's a shame to see that in the end he's criminally underused. He's mostly kept away from the action, and simply not as interesting as previous villains because a lot of the things he's done to earn his reputation are never shown - only implied by the game and told about in passing in cutscenes. He's more often shown lecturing his impressionable young son Diego - a dynamic and a relationship that also doesn't feel as pivotal to the game as originally promised. There are a couple of scenes where Giancarlo Esposito gets to really show his teeth and these are undoubtedly memorable, but more often than not Anton is relegated to just being a bit of a shit dad. He lacks the grandiose psychopathy of Vaas, the flamboyant mischievousness of Pagan Min and the stomach-churning creepiness of Joseph Seed. And that just makes for a duller game. Far Cry wants to have its cake and eat it - it wants that beautifully chaotic, whacky gameplay where murderous roosters and backpack payloads come together to deliver a fireworks display of explosions alongside meaty headshots from a Surf n' Turf themed sniper rifle. But then it wants to suddenly get all serious and deliver a contemplative dictator who wants to give his son a better life through what he deems necessary bloodshed and slavery. It's a juxtaposition that doesn't always work.Far Cry 6's wide array of supporting characters, not bound by the often sombre tone of the main plot, fare much better. They're a familiar blend of a little bit wacky, a little bit irreverent, and very often homicidal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19e3b131-c659-4fd4-ab11-74b9f38f0504": {"__data__": {"id_": "19e3b131-c659-4fd4-ab11-74b9f38f0504", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d62e8a6-fa18-4695-bb36-27299429deda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "125ad8b29cd06c932e5fb744416d5c16be95e1af3b6af27e809f9772ebda7494"}, "3": {"node_id": "83d82a55-5b64-4b69-8998-da0520badee4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bfe8e43765be19e2d3e71effaef891dd8d41a7b7336cac037114bc9e4a6ed28e"}}, "hash": "ab8ffb2915c9b4ad3992253ac7ec189a321f4c733fd7e8a533fb5f295db54eb4", "text": "Far Cry 6 is at its best when it's leaning into its more ridiculous impulses - fully acknowledging the absurdity of its open world and the plentiful opportunities for chaos it provides. While some of the main campaign stories do deliver some thrilling moments, the side missions like the Treasure Hunts and the Yaran Stories provide the most fun. It's in these optional asides that the game is let off the leash a little, allowing for more imaginative missions compared to the now familiar \"take down base, rinse and repeat\" mission structure of the main campaign. Instead, there are Indiana Jones-style hunts for Crystal Skulls, haunted graveyards, and an explosive encounter with a very annoying YouTuber, to name just a few.Because make no mistake, what a lot of fans are really here for is the wide open freedom promised by Far Cry 6's colossal map, and for the most part - in the wilds and beaches and mountains of Yara - that doesn't disappoint. The main city Esperanza - billed as the biggest urban landscape in Far Cry history - is less open than expected. Some players may have hoped to parkour across the city, scrambling up buildings and taking in those sights, but in reality you can only go to certain areas as most of the city is locked off and inaccessible. You can't climb most of the buildings, and you can't fly in there either - so no base jumping from the top of Anton's Palace. Essentially, there's not much to do or see outside of places Ubisoft is directing the action - most buildings are fake and you can't enter them - so eventually you'll start to crave the more rural areas of Yara once more.Out here, you're given access to most land, air and sea vehicles quickly, though air defences are set up around Yara which must be blown up in order for you to clear the skies and therefore be able to fly in or air drop in safely without the risk of exploding. But if you don't fancy air travel, horses are a neat way to get around too - Far Cry 6 marks their first inclusion in a Far Cry game, and they're a welcome addition, mostly because they're generally resistant to blowing up or catching on fire. Mostly.Interestingly, there's no skill tree this time around. Instead, you equip and wear different clothes to enhance your abilities or grant you various buffs or resistances. You can change clothes whenever you want and full sets can grant bonuses, but in all honesty these perks do seem rather minor so you may find yourself dressing more for fashion rather than function. More useful is Dani's ability to change up their weapons on the fly, wherever and whenever you want. You'll amass an absolutely huge selection of weapons in the game over time, so it's useful that you can whip any of them out of storage and into your weapon wheel at any time mid battle - likely when a stealthy encounter shifts quite suddenly into an explosive stand-off. Central to this combat system now are Supremos - a sort of ultimate attack  that takes time to recharge, but can be super useful in battles. You start off with a Supremo that fires off a barrage of rockets, capable of bringing down a helicopter or a tank in one attack, but over time you'll unlock an assortment of Supremos to suit your own flavour of combat.Given that Dani and their allies are all part of an underground resistance movement, their weapons, modifications and the tools at their disposal are all cobbled together by using everyday items found lying around Yara. This 'Resolver' concept, as it's called in the game, is what fuels Far Cry 6's customisation mechanics. You can earn money to buy weapons, but by scrabbling around each area for scraps, you'll be able to spend those on unlocking different, interchangeable mods for your guns and supremos. And there's a ton of options out there to pick up, build and experiment with. Sometimes, perhaps, a touch too much - the sheer amount of collectibles to hoover up gets a little overwhelming at times. This installment also marks the first time a main series game hasn't had a dedicated multiplayer mode or map editor, which I know is going to be a deal breaker for some people. Sure, Far Cry's previous attempts at multiplayer haven't exactly been the most polished of experiences, but they were certainly home to a once loyal and now forgotten community who bought the games specifically to build and experience user created maps. It's not all doom and gloom for Far Cry fans with friends though, there is a co-operative mode that allows you to play through the majority of the game with a partner (which to is a lot of fun) along with 8 standalone missions called Special Operations that take place across smaller, uniquely themed maps.

Considering the scale of the map and everything going on inside it I never once during my playtime had the game crash on me which is good, but I certainly witnessed a lot of crazy glitches and rough edges. Played on the PS5, screen tearing was prominent, frame rate dips took the tension out of cutscenes and the NPC AI, be it enemy or friendly, was at times absolutely atrocious. One time I fast travelled to a friendly base and as soon as I spawned I began to slowly choke to death, even though there was no poison gas present. Another time all the voices in the game stopped working necessitating a restart and the less said about the weird potato beards some of the characters kept growing, the better.  But, as much fun as noodling around Far Cry 6's world is, it's probably wise to bear in mind the words of Far Cry 3's Vaas when he attempted to explain the definition of insanity. \"Insanity\", he said \"is doing the exact same fucking thing, over and over again, expecting shit to change.\", and I'd say that statement rings true here, because, beyond the slide towards one-man army protagonists, shit has definitely not changed. If you were looking for a sequel that would shake up the series and bring about a gameplay revolution, you're going to be disappointed, but if you enjoy that classic Far Cry collect-em-up grind and simply want a brand new sandbox to explore and explode, you're going to be  far from bored with all that Yara has to offer.\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nIan Higton\n\n          Video Producer\n        Ian is a video producer, keen streamer, VR enthusiast, battle royale fan and retro connoisseur.

Open world action FPS set in the fictional Caribbean island of Yara.\nReleased October 7, 2021\nExpect to pay $60/\u00a350\nDeveloper Ubisoft\nPublisher Ubisoft\nReviewed on Intel i7-9700F, RTX 2070 Super, 32GB RAM\nMultiplayer? Two-player co-op\nLink Official siteThe fictional island of Yara is as beautiful as it is predictable. There are sunny beaches, friendly locals serving street food you're somehow not allowed to buy, and sharks in the water that want to take a bite out of you. The music you hear blasting from homes and cars is upbeat, there's a constant party vibe in the air and there are wild horses you can actually ride.That's where Yara's uniqueness ends and an uneasy sense of parody begins for me. While Ubisoft is determined to make Giancarlo Esposito's despot, Ant\u00f3n Castillo, feel like a real and credible threat, he's more of a satirical mash-up of Franco and Castro. He's definitely a bad guy with a vision for his country that he holds above all\u2014even family, as he often reminds his son and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Diego\u2014but there's a two-dimensional vibe I just can't shake. We'll come back to him later.Far Cry 6 is a quintessential Far Cry game. You begin as an underdog who quickly ends up with the moniker of Hero, fleeing some tyrannical bastard who's wrecking the lives of the locals to make his dream a reality. In this case, he's made a smokable cancer cure, Viviro. Viviro is farmed and produced by slaves from Yara\u2014Castillo labels them as Outcasts and Fake Yarans, setting the us-and-them tone in the game's opening sequence.Much like its predecessors, you can grapple your way up cliffs and buildings\u2014truly revolutionary stuff, I know\u2014use your phone to track enemies and their weaknesses and, for the first time, simply holster your weapon so you don't look super sus running around with a sniper rifle. Ubisoft has borrowed the cloaked mechanic from Assassin's Creed in the sense that as long as you and your holstered weapon don't stand too close to guards or act in a suspicious way, you can pass through checkpoints with no violence. It also works as a stealth mechanic, where you can saunter up to a vehicle, quickly whip your pistol out and assassinate the driver before stealing a prison truck.You'll also want to destroy anti-aircraft guns when you find them, otherwise, you won't be able to fly around Yara\u2014or progress the story in some sections. There are still the usual animal hunting missions, too, and new Criptograma Chests that lead to unique gear.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32ef4db8-2117-4fb8-94ba-e185227e8f43": {"__data__": {"id_": "32ef4db8-2117-4fb8-94ba-e185227e8f43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "23c58d44-0c5f-4dab-b6d0-5f6c626d81f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc0a81b94707099a93bcb3ecd1b3716dee1f58ce7f2ea725732b0e2345356c67"}, "3": {"node_id": "c947e353-f0f6-41e1-b718-27d419373ae8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1cb0fdad2bdc397e1a984965c4c9060d7bf98759f83a15a029e873e6efbb028d"}}, "hash": "3b215e6594480c04f1c1f98088db3a23e4ca660c721cff5df3e64501c3c11ca4", "text": "Much like Far Cry 5, you can choose whether you want to play as a female or male Dani Rojas, though you can't customise their appearance\u2014not unless you get the same bug I did after using the photo mode, where Dani was stuck with an unfortunate wink/cheeky tongue out combo in cutscenes for an hour or so. Dani is an orphan who was previously conscripted into Yara's military, so is familiar with the people fighting for El Presidente and country\u2014and knows that not all of them are bad guys.She begins as many underdogs do: unaware of what she truly believes in. As she comes to understand the plight of the people and Diego's suffering at the hands of his father, we see her alliances shift and her core beliefs strengthen. Family\u2014whether through blood or friendship\u2014is a core theme in Far Cry 6 and one Dani struggles to reconcile given her history.In the first few hours of Far Cry 6, you'll hear the word \"guerrilla\" more times than you'll be able to count. Juan Carlos, a veteran guerrilla, will school you on his guerrilla rules on how to be a guerrilla and succeed in guerrilla warfare. It's repetitive, yes, and typical of how the game treats its revolutionaries as caricatures, but he does at least give you one major gamechanger: the Supremo.In the first few hours of Far Cry 6, you'll hear the word \"guerrilla\" more times than you'll be able to countThe Supremo is like an ugly backbling that brings way too much power to a fight. You can combo it with a weapon to inflict terrible damage on your opponents as you see fit. You'll begin with a flamethrower and rocket launcher combo that's just as stupid and OP as it sounds. My advice? Pair it with the flame retardant gloves\u2014much like in Far Cry 5, the entire environment can catch fire and I spent way too long dying in the blaze. Later on, you'll unlock another Supremo that unleashes an EMP attack that can take out security systems and vehicles. When you're being pursued by cars, trucks and helicopters, you can see why this would come in handy.There are other silly yet effective weapons available in-game, too, like the CD Launcher that questionably blasts the Macarena. Overall, the combat is as good as it's ever been. You can sneak your way around and take out enemies with melee kills or headshots, or go in all guns and Supremos blazing. You can modify weapons at workbenches, adding better sights, suppressors and ammo types into the mix, as well as change their appearance and add little charms. There's also the season pass's Blood Dragon gear which is hilariously out of place in Yara, complete with the Kobracon sniper rifle\u2014which is just as badass, by the way\u2014and your friendly metal amigo, K-9000.Speaking of amigos, there are no humans who will follow you around in Far Cry 6, but you will meet a healthy bunch of animal compadres. There's the loveable Chorizo, a little dachshund in a wheelchair who will distract enemies, allowing you to sneak past. Yes, all of my guns do have little Chorizo bone charms, thanks for asking. There's also Chicharr\u00f3n the fiesty rooster and Guapo the crocodile, who will both fuck up your enemies. Amigos are effective in the field and add a welcome bit of comic relief to fights. It really is something to be headshotting enemies then turning around to see a tiny dog biting a guy in the face.As I said earlier, you can also find and ride wild horses now, and are able to pet and feed all manner of wildlife around Yara. If riding horses isn't your jam, you can fly helicopters, drive a range of land and sea vehicles and even fly a plane. I crash most of my planes within seconds\u2014I am obviously not destined to become a pilot\u2014but it's still fun to tour Yara from above and imagine you're going on a nice Caribbean holiday after nearly two years of living through hell.Sadly the vehicles are pretty terrible to drive\u2014they don't turn left or right enough when steering, and it feels like your viewpoint isn't centred enough, as if your head was poking out the window a little. Every vehicle\u2014even the horse\u2014felt way too fast, even with the sensitivity turned down.you're just stumbling around with this giant, deadly backpack thing and tripping over dogs, roosters and junkPlaying on a 2070 Super, I experienced a few crashes and bugs, too, such as the weird face bug and a few floating NPCs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c947e353-f0f6-41e1-b718-27d419373ae8": {"__data__": {"id_": "c947e353-f0f6-41e1-b718-27d419373ae8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "32ef4db8-2117-4fb8-94ba-e185227e8f43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b215e6594480c04f1c1f98088db3a23e4ca660c721cff5df3e64501c3c11ca4"}, "3": {"node_id": "388f3fa8-fd32-4523-970d-88712995d36f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "01010c34ef2f876af7fbf32990845d92071b482124eeb0cb86862a4a4be06daa"}}, "hash": "1cb0fdad2bdc397e1a984965c4c9060d7bf98759f83a15a029e873e6efbb028d", "text": "For whatever reason, the whites of the eyes around each character's iris wouldn't stay a solid colour, either, so unless every character was on drugs, something was amiss here.\u00a0There are also a few weird sections in camps that have you playing in third-person. It's like in Mass Effect where you can't jump, instead, you're just stumbling around with this giant, deadly backpack thing and tripping over dogs, roosters and junk. Speaking of the camps, there are new Los Bandidos missions where you can send a Yaran Leader to complete separate missions\u2014sort of like how Dragon Age Inquisition's war table missions work. You can assign a leader to a mission, then after a set amount of time, you'll be able to choose what method they use to complete the mission, depending on the leader's perks. It wasn't very clear how it or the co-op mode contribute to the story, bar collecting more resources and Pesos, but they're a nice distraction nonetheless.It wouldn't be a Far Cry game without a few twists, though I'll leave this review spoiler-free. Betrayal is at the heart of Far Cry 6, from Castillo's deception to the world about how Viviro is grown and manufactured, to the grievances within the guerrillas and Dani's own relationship with the regime. A lot of the betrayal is predictable\u2014this isn't my first Far Cry rodeo, after all\u2014 but there are enough surprises to keep you happy. It's also difficult to separate Castillo from Esposito's stint as Gus Fring\u2014both are charming, two-faced and, ultimately, Grade-A bastards\u2014which, depending on whether you enjoyed Breaking Bad or not, will make his character more or less appealing.\u00a0There's less pomp and exaggeration with this villain compared to Far Cry 5's Joseph Seed; Castillo is just as committed to his cause, that's for sure, but he's much more traditional and realistic due to his seat of power. He shines an uneasy light on potential goings-on in the world\u2014the 'politics' that Ubisoft seems keen to distance itself from acknowledging\u2014highlighting that all the 'good' things we receive might be the results of modern-day slavery and corruption. There's little to laugh at with Far Cry 6's story, instead leaving a sour taste as you wonder about reality and the state of the world. And for that, I definitely recommend you play it. Well, that and the fact there's around a million wee dogs you can pet.Yara is super lush and wonderful to explore, but the story and main villain are predictable.The first three games Lauren played on PC were Star Wars: X-Wing, Zoo Tycoon and Barbie Fashion Designer, which explains her love of all things space, strategy and aesthetically pleasing.

The first four or so hours of the game were a baffling thrillride, it seemed no matter what I did every mission descended into an all-out brawl, with stealth attempts scuppered by mongoose attacks, enemy tank patrols popping up with alarming regularity, and in a weird bit of emergent narrative, I saw more NPC horses and dogs hit by cars than I care to remember. Every mission I scraped through felt rough and ready, and like there had to be a better way, or I just hadn't quite unlocked the right equipment yet - the wingsuit, a rocket launcher, a sniper rifle\u2026? It was as if that trademark Far Cry power fantasy feeling was always just out of reach. Once I had made it through that early stage though, and onto the main map of the Yaran mainland, it all clicked back into place.\u00a0This time around it isn't about vacationing dude bros, a trip to dump some cremation ashes, or a weird cult. Far Cry 6 wants to tackle the much more realistic storyline of a country ruled by brutal dictator Anton Castillo and everything that entails, from slavery to LGBTQ+ rights. You play as a male or female version of Dani Rojas, would-be regime escapee turned guerrilla revolutionary. To put it simply, your job is to eff up as much of Castillo's bag as possible with violence, stealth, and explosives, taking out anti-craft guns, sabotaging his factories, and murdering his powerful supporters.\u00a0As the story progresses you'll team up with other pockets of resistance, winning them over with your own personal brand of death and destruction to help their causes, and freeing up different provinces along the way. Your guerilla starter kit includes a crocodile companion 'Amigo' called Guapo, a Supremo backpack that is essentially a wearable ultimate ability, and a mix of standard and improvised weapons from shotguns to things that shoot CDs. Follow the story and sidequests and you'll unlock more of all of the above, and your inventory will soon look like the attic of a very unstable, weaponized hoarder.Far Cry 6 definitely feels like the turning point for a series in transition. Everything you know and love about it is still there - crazy weapons, clearing checkpoints, murderous wildlife, climbing to obscure locations - but the small changes that have been made have a big impact on the overall experience. Most notable at first is actually seeing Dani, your character is now more than just some eyeballs you stare through. When you reach a guerilla camp or hit a cutscene the game swaps from first-person to third-person, letting you see your character - and whatever terrible outfit you've chosen for them - with friends, foes, and the events of the storyline. The facial expressions are well done, and seeing Dani actually react to the world and its terrors makes for a more compelling cutscene every time.On the game mechanics side, there are big changes under the hood. Someone chopped down the skill trees and made a wardrobe with the wood. Now instead of using skill points to purchase perks or abilities, any changes to Dani's base stats come from the kit they equip in the form of headwear, shirts, trousers, shoes, and gloves. A particular watch ups your defense stats against blast rounds, a safari hat tags animals around you automatically for easy tracking, the Fuego gloves mean when you're on fire you put yourself out automatically, rather than needing to mash a button. It's a nice idea, suiting up before a hunt with animal protection buffing clothes, stealth-friendly outfits for assassinations, but in big battles, the reality is pausing the action to quickly change Dani's trousers in a menu - which is quite the mental image. \u00a0I missed the simplicity of purchasing perks and never having to think about them again, but the ability to tailor will appeal to anyone that feels at home in anything like Destiny menu. I started out hating it, by the end of the game, me and Far Cry 6 had come to a respectful if uneasy truce - one where I tried to face a tank dressed in fishing gear at least twice before spotting my mistake in a cutscene.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "067ae196-9a82-42e9-a491-cdcf827387f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "067ae196-9a82-42e9-a491-cdcf827387f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "388f3fa8-fd32-4523-970d-88712995d36f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "01010c34ef2f876af7fbf32990845d92071b482124eeb0cb86862a4a4be06daa"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e066579-75b3-46bb-a185-51054aa7b821", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "314d6d0c6947627e8537c16823645cc38fb24782037bbcb922ed3c05cbf9416c"}}, "hash": "85be9bb368a6623e9c942d571c22dc1798df4dbd660189654583fde667634d91", "text": "In a nice touch for fashionistas, you can transmog each item of kit so even if you need some ugly sneakers that help with tripwires, you can make them look like anything else from the same category that you have in your collection. You too can know the thrill of wearing a fishing vest disguised as body armor.\u00a0The new Supremo Backpacks also come in a range of flavors - stealth, explosives, hunting - each packing a super ability that recharges over time and can turn the tide of an encounter in seconds. As with your more traditional weapons, they can be upgraded with mod slots, purchased at vendors, and swapped at will. Your Supremo also dictates which gadgets - grenades, healing syringes, EMPs - appear in your weapon wheel. As a lazy ass tank with very little nuance to my playstyle, I faced most of the game with the same explosive Supremo you get at the beginning, finding it just too much of a lifesaver when taking out tanks and helicopters with a single hit to ever really let it go.\u00a0For the first few hours, even if you're one of the Far Cry faithful, you should expect to feel a little bit lost as you master these tweaks to the system. It's like coming back into the office to find someone has moved all your stuff around, only rather than misplacing your favorite mug, here you're not sure why your molotovs aren't appearing in your weapon wheel.\u00a0One controversial question, though - has Far Cry 6 made its Amigo animal companions too damn adorable this time around? Between a tiny dog in a wheelchair and customizable outfits, I was maybe too emotionally invested in their welfare. Whole missions were absolutely banjaxed by my crocodile or dog or panther getting themselves in trouble and me dropping absolutely every objective and any concern for my own health meter to go and help them. It wasn't even a gameplay consideration, they can be revived or at worse resummoned after a short wait - I just couldn't bear seeing anyone hurt them. It's not a real complaint, more a warning for anyone with a soul who doesn't like seeing a puppy getting kicked. You\u2019re going to mess up a lot of encounters.There was also a lot more cock than I was expecting in my Far Cry 6. Roosters are a recurring theme to the point where I'm wondering if someone on the Ubisoft team had a particularly traumatic experience with chickens at an early age. You can collect roosters, play as a rooster in a cockfighting side game that PETA is absolutely going to lose its mind over, gain a punk rooster Amigo and even some of the Stories of Yara side quests revolve around eggs and birds and rooster spurs. One for someone's psychoanalyst to ponder for sure.\u00a0Despite the cute animals in all the trailers, Far Cry 6 should come with a massive trigger warning for a lot of reasons. It's not just the violence - though the close-up machete kills that see you ram the blade right into the skull of your victim are pretty brutal - it's the way the story really wants you to know that Castillo is a villain by showing, not telling. The game opens with mass murder and cracks on at the same pace from there, so expect to see corpses - so many corpses - medical experimentation on live subjects, some very clumsy handling of a trans rights storyline, human trafficking, torture, and more. It's not that games shouldn't tackle this stuff, it's just hard to make the tonal switch from the absolute degradation of humanity to \"look, we made a minigame that looks like Street Fighter, but with chickens!\" It's like the writing team sat in one room, researching political history and watching prestige HBO dramas like Chernobyl and the gameplay team sat way over the other side of the studio adding unicorns, firework guns, and crocodile helmets for 90% of development, and then the two came together at the end and tried to duct tape their ideas together.\u00a0Aside from that, I was grateful that this Far Cry went easy on the woo-woo hallucinogenic scenes it's been such a big fan of in the past. There were no spirit quests or magical adventures, just a few missions that involved being super drunk or driving a car while off your nut on poison gas.\u00a0After all the horror and roosters, the ending to the Far Cry main campaign felt rushed and too simple, leaving me emotionally unsatisfied. It\u2019s a shame, because Giancarlo Esposito isn't someone you encounter much beyond some cutscenes and in-game TV screens but when he does appear he's electric and truly intimidating, and more than earning his fee.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e066579-75b3-46bb-a185-51054aa7b821": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e066579-75b3-46bb-a185-51054aa7b821", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "067ae196-9a82-42e9-a491-cdcf827387f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "85be9bb368a6623e9c942d571c22dc1798df4dbd660189654583fde667634d91"}, "3": {"node_id": "b03dcb37-741c-4969-a7e9-9d34a8c11010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8ee09dc8f88480fe008ccc084bdb5d49f14840184119a2067dd3cd6bb606f31"}}, "hash": "314d6d0c6947627e8537c16823645cc38fb24782037bbcb922ed3c05cbf9416c", "text": "The final stumble wasn\u2019t one that put me off going past the credits and straight back into Yara to see what I'd missed.Every treasure hunt and side mission was still there for me to work my way through, something that feels like it could take weeks, and there was even a new Insurgency system that adds new area leaders for me to kill.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, GameCentral reviews Ubisoft\u2019s latest open world adventure and what may be the best Far Cry game yet.Despite rarely having a single character or setting in common, games in the Far Cry series are still all recognisably part of the same franchise. They all feature a seemingly doomed fight against oppression by a single hero taking on overwhelming odds. They\u2019re also justly famed for their lurches in tone, combining larger-than-life comedy characters with horrifying brutality. In these febrile times, it\u2019s a balancing act that Ubisoft desperately needed to get right again.For better or worse, Far Cry 6 is a game that definitely doesn\u2019t pull its punches. It\u2019s set on the fictional island of Yara, which is \u2018inspired\u2019 by Cuba. With the decaying splendour of its buildings\u2019 brightly coloured facades, 1950s cars, and a dictatorship that trades in revolutionary language, it certain seems to have a great deal in common with Cuba. On a superficial level at least, its natural beauty, spectacular sunsets and brief but intense rainstorms make for a dramatic backdrop to your counter-revolutionary antics.You play Dani Rojas, one of Yara\u2019s outcasts, an underclass of orphans and the poverty-stricken, who are routinely kidnapped and used as slave labour by the regime to grow Viviro, supposedly a herbal cure for cancer. That involves spraying tobacco crops with a pesticide called PG-240, which also happens to be extremely poisonous to humans, making it an ideal chemical weapon.Rather than go meekly along with his or her fate \u2013 you choose Dani\u2019s gender in the opening scene \u2013 you try to escape to Miami. When that plan fails you instead join Libertad, a local guerrilla movement bent on toppling the island\u2019s evil dictator, Ant\u00f3n Castillo, played with sinister aplomb by Breaking Bad\u2019s Giancarlo Esposito. Starting with the traditional Far Cry scene-setting stroll through utter chaos and destruction, you\u2019re soon a small cog in the revolutionary machine.Although it\u2019s steeped in the series\u2019 mores, there are immediate differences in this outing. Firstly, Dani speaks. Unlike the stoically mute protagonists of recent Far Cries, Dani\u2019s actually pretty chatty, and also apparently a music lover, regularly engaging in lusty singalongs with the stereo in whatever vehicle they\u2019ve most recently commandeered.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b03dcb37-741c-4969-a7e9-9d34a8c11010": {"__data__": {"id_": "b03dcb37-741c-4969-a7e9-9d34a8c11010", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e066579-75b3-46bb-a185-51054aa7b821", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "314d6d0c6947627e8537c16823645cc38fb24782037bbcb922ed3c05cbf9416c"}, "3": {"node_id": "74bd98fb-d3e1-4dcb-8909-54324ded28ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bdebfdb98b06b64423ba6f14cc72b94691905e8b213b86779d210ba1f7f68833"}}, "hash": "e8ee09dc8f88480fe008ccc084bdb5d49f14840184119a2067dd3cd6bb606f31", "text": "Male Dani\u2019s rendition of Livin\u2019 La Vida Loca is especially memorable.As in Far Cry 5, you\u2019re allowed to bring a sidekick when you head into battle. Unlike that game\u2019s mix of humans and animals, here all your companions are beasts, from the aggressive fighting rooster, Chicharron, to disabled sausage dog, Chorizo whose back legs trundle around in a miniature wheelchair. You can direct your animal buddies around the battlefield but also need to revive them when they get shot or blown up. Other than that, they behave autonomously, targeting enemies for you and acting as a useful distraction in firefights.Wild animals are also important. Hunting and fishing are major side activities available throughout the game\u2019s sizeable landmass, although random attacks have been toned down significantly compared with past games. You can still receive a light mauling from sharks, crocs, eagles, and the odd mongoose but none of them is much of a threat, and their reduced incidence makes them less of an annoyance.In fact, one thing that marks out Far Cry 6 is its powerful desire to remove anything that might conceivably become an irritation, and to give you all the fun toys to play with as quickly as it possibly can. That means you no longer have to choose between carrying a vehicle repair blowtorch and an extra gun. You also gain access to a huge arsenal of weaponry, silenced and loud, from very early in the game, along with the series\u2019 trademark wing suit and parachute.As well as conventional guns, bows, grenades, and rocket launchers you can also acquire \u2018Resolver\u2019 weapons, built from salvaged scrap by resident blowhard and ageing revolutionary, Juan Cortez, who provides early comic relief after the game\u2019s nasty introductory sequence. His guns have a range of applications, from a backpack that fires guided rockets at unfortunate groups of enemies to an EMP that takes down tanks and helicopters, and a medical bag designed for use in co-op.To get all those you need to trade supplies looted from enemy bases, army checkpoints, and corpses. That means gaining intel from rebels you encounter as you drive around the archipelago, leading you to enemy anti-aircraft installations and roadblocks. The former prevent you from flying helicopters and wing suits in their vicinity and the latter put down road spikes to stall your progress in cars, so both carry useful rewards, both in currency terms and freedom of movement.Once you\u2019ve cleared the way, getting around Yara is a breeze. Not only can you fast travel to any safe house, captured base or checkpoint but you can choose to be airdropped from high above them, using your wingsuit and parachute to hurtle to practically any destination in moments. Combined with PlayStation 5\u2019s sub-five second load times, it gives an unprecedented sense of freedom.You can also call in a ride wherever you happen to be. Your car arrives with a machinegun turret on its roof and is upgradeable, so you can add more powerful guns, a battering ram at the front, and various types of armour depending on the kind of pounding you\u2019re likely to receive on a mission. That turns out to be one of the game\u2019s departures in that you and your car can now change armour to defend against bullets, explosions, fire or poison. You may well find in practice you don\u2019t often get around to that level of customisation, but if a mission\u2019s proving too tricky it\u2019s a way of tilting the odds in your favour.That doesn\u2019t happen often though. Far Cry has always had to manage the experience of your character\u2019s inevitable transformation from plucky underdog to implacable killing machine, and in this case that tipping point occurs just after the halfway mark, or roughly when you unlock and upgrade the Pyrotechno Resolver weapon, and your Exterminador supremo backpack. Their large volumes of explosive ordnance can take down helicopters in a single volley, and tanks in two. It\u2019s about that time that you really start to feel like a one-man, or woman, army.Dani\u2019s a former soldier, making their comfort in holding and using firearms less jarring than past episodes, where the hero\u2019s sudden penchant for slaughtering henchmen is at odds with their life as a civilian. It\u2019s still sometimes an uneasy mix of comedy and ultra violence, although this outing\u2019s jokes seem to land more evenly than they have in recent episodes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74bd98fb-d3e1-4dcb-8909-54324ded28ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "74bd98fb-d3e1-4dcb-8909-54324ded28ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b03dcb37-741c-4969-a7e9-9d34a8c11010", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8ee09dc8f88480fe008ccc084bdb5d49f14840184119a2067dd3cd6bb606f31"}, "3": {"node_id": "08fbddf7-bf8b-4236-824b-8ef75142b64b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9ece13232910980ebd5b058bfa455a098a41b77a600251f354ffcf5a584438c"}}, "hash": "bdebfdb98b06b64423ba6f14cc72b94691905e8b213b86779d210ba1f7f68833", "text": "Without the humourlessly militaristic realism of Ghost Recon, the comic book violence feels somehow less egregious.It\u2019s a tightrope though, and despite Ubisoft\u2019s avowedly apolitical approach, the islanders\u2019 attitude towards Americans, or \u2018Yanquis\u2019 as they have it, takes in both their early reliance on slave labour and its replacement with a private prison system built to create an indentured workforce. Interestingly, one of the game\u2019s arch-baddies, whom you need to deal with on your way to offing El Presidente, is a chemical weapons manufacturing money man who turns out to be Canadian rather than the evil Yanqui he initially appears to be. He even makes a point about Canada\u2019s treatment of its indigenous population, making sure nobody is above reproach.It\u2019s a theme that runs through the game. In a first for the series there are regular scenes where your character isn\u2019t even present, showing Castillo inculcating his 13-year-old son into the ways of being a dictator. They\u2019re expectedly brutal, but his son\u2019s conflicted, and while he\u2019s no white knight, he\u2019s clearly more aware of the misuse of power than his father, who seems perfectly at ease with the rivers of blood his reign creates.Gunplay is as effective as ever, and while in the early part of the game enemies can be frustratingly bullet-spongey that all goes away when you start upgrading. Aircraft are fun to fly, and vehicles actually handle reasonably well. Importantly, the way activities and side stories are incorporated into both the plot and environment gives the game a newly coherent feel, with extra-curricular activities feeling more like entertainment than distraction.Treasure hunts also make a welcome return, each one forming its own miniature story and puzzle, with no two even remotely similar. Taking on a scattering of races, raids, checkpoints, treasure hunts and story missions gives a solid impression of variety that only starts to wear thin a long way into its 50+ hour play time. Clearly that level of commitment won\u2019t be for everyone, but if you enjoy taking in the fully panoply of non-story missions, there\u2019s enough here to make it more lifestyle than game, for a few weeks at least.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationThere are glitches. We needed to restart the game a couple of times, and there was one mission we eventually had to abandon altogether after it auto-reset itself for the third time, but for a game of this scale it could have been worse. Given its inspiring diversity, if you\u2019re not enjoying a quest or something goes wrong, there are always fresh delights around the next corner.Dani is a charming and convincing revolutionary and even though the action amounts either to traversal or shooting people, the way the story and side missions work together keeps things feeling fresh and lively throughout the lengthy play time. And you will never read the word \u2018guerrilla\u2019 in your mind in quite the same way again. After playing this, it will forever rhyme with \u2018mama mia\u2019.In Short: Colourful and brutal, funny and horrifying, Far Cry 6 is the distilled essence of its franchise, as well as a richer and more coherent experience than recent outings.Pros: Spectacular scenery and greatly reduced HUD clutter make the most of its tropical setting. It also has superb mission variety, great characters, and a wonderfully dark sense of humour.Cons: Aiming the tank\u2019s gun is an unnecessary chore and the game\u2019s blend of savagery and comedy will sit uneasily with some. Each time you cross into a new district its name appears, needlessly removing every other element of your HUD.Score: 8/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed), Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series S/X, PC, Stadia, and LunaPrice: \u00a359.99Publisher: UbisoftDeveloper: Ubisoft TorontoRelease Date: 7th October 2021Age Rating: 18By Nick GillettEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : Far Cry 6 teases new free-to-play battle royale spin-off\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Far Cry 6 developer interview: \u2018we approached it with as much sensitivity as we could\u2019", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08fbddf7-bf8b-4236-824b-8ef75142b64b": {"__data__": {"id_": "08fbddf7-bf8b-4236-824b-8ef75142b64b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "74bd98fb-d3e1-4dcb-8909-54324ded28ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bdebfdb98b06b64423ba6f14cc72b94691905e8b213b86779d210ba1f7f68833"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0d3b4c8-c557-43b2-8e10-867d526b66fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4fee54d2bc8294faca0ae57d4604c66bffc024154ea4803583dcf9d6a9a66dd"}}, "hash": "b9ece13232910980ebd5b058bfa455a098a41b77a600251f354ffcf5a584438c", "text": "MORE : Far Cry 6: Stranger Things and Rambo crossover DLC will be free\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.ukFor more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGame Informer, From the Montana wilderness to the frozen peaks of the Himalayas, the Far Cry franchise has taken players across the globe for action-packed adventures. Far Cry 6 carries on the series\u2019 trademark of delivering a massive, open-world playground where players fight for control against a powerful villain. While the dark story sometimes contrasts harshly with goofy side content and characters, Far Cry 6 fires on all cylinders to deliver one of the series\u2019 best games.Far Cry 6 is a nonstop thrill ride from start to finish, delivering a wide variety of activities to pursue within its vast open world. The mainline missions often center on infiltrating enemy-controlled territory to undermine the rule of Ant\u00f3n Castillo, the ruthless dictator of the fictional Caribbean nation of Yara. Whether you\u2019re blowing up Castillo\u2019s fuel tanks, burning down his plantations, or taking out high-value targets, Far Cry 6 offers a variety of action-packed ways to topple the ruling regime.True to the series, Far Cry 6 enables you to play your way. Strong shooting mechanics allowed me to easily string together headshots with my suppressed rifle as I moved through an area undetected. If I messed up a kill and the enemy caught on to my presence, the solid gunplay works well in the chaos of a firefight.Most of the time, I used standard rifles, pistols, and shotguns (all of which are customizable). You also have access to unique, unlockable Resolver weapons (special guns with unique abilities and attributes) and Supremos (ultimate abilities that operate on a cooldown), which add a ton of firepower to your repertoire. I preferred to use stealthy tactics whenever possible, so I loved bringing a Resolver nail gun for silent takedowns. However, I was also glad to have a Supremo with homing rockets handy to take out armored tanks and pesky helicopters.If you want a break from the main story, the massive and utterly gorgeous island of Yara offers terrific variety and seemingly unending side content. Taking down military checkpoints, blasting anti-aircraft cannons, and helping characters with side missions are all supremely satisfying ways to nudge Castillo\u2019s empire toward erosion. Despite Yara\u2019s massive size, getting to your next destination is easy thanks to summonable vehicles and a wingsuit; you can even airdrop onto fast-travel points to quickly soar in any direction.While you can approach most situations however you like, the A.I. sometimes impedes your plans. At times, enemies disregard nearby dead bodies, while other times they had a seemingly supernatural perception of my presence. When combined with uneven difficulty spikes and occasionally unforgiving checkpoints, these inconsistencies lead to frustrating moments in an otherwise excellent experience.Narratively, Far Cry 6 starts with a punch to the gut. As Dani Rojas, you have your one-way ticket out of Yara. After things go south through a series of emotional scenes, Dani joins the resistance. As a member of Libertad, Dani\u2019s primary task is recruiting other guerrillas, with the eventual goal of dethroning Yara\u2019s bloodthirsty dictator.Giancarlo Esposito, of Breaking Bad and The Mandalorian fame, masterfully portrays President Castillo. While he only appears in cutscenes between main story missions, his presence looms large thanks to regularly played propaganda speeches, giant billboards featuring his face, and his name at the center of most conversations. In Far Cry\u2019s rich annals of fantastic antagonists, Castillo stands among the most\u00a0menacing. But Castillo isn\u2019t the only noteworthy villain, as he surrounds himself with truly despicable people who I couldn\u2019t wait to take a shot at.The rest of the cast is memorable, and Dani is perhaps the best Far Cry protagonist to date. However, for every authentic character, there\u2019s another that is a caricature. These borderline cartoonish people are especially jarring in a story centered on a bloody revolution. You see plenty of terrible things happen to both good and bad people, and Far Cry 6 still struggles with the precarious balancing act of telling a dark, serious story and delivering the carefree thrills players expect from the franchise.The dissonance between Far Cry\u2019s two sides has always been challenging to reconcile, but Far Cry 6 handles this balance better than most entries in the series.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0d3b4c8-c557-43b2-8e10-867d526b66fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0d3b4c8-c557-43b2-8e10-867d526b66fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "08fbddf7-bf8b-4236-824b-8ef75142b64b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9ece13232910980ebd5b058bfa455a098a41b77a600251f354ffcf5a584438c"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c193f85-49af-4d69-be29-1952a90c981d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e6221903cb7289101107c26a30833c2f2a4313445fffdcf37518e49e798436e"}}, "hash": "c4fee54d2bc8294faca0ae57d4604c66bffc024154ea4803583dcf9d6a9a66dd", "text": "Many zanier missions and storylines are relegated to side content and player choice; if you don\u2019t want to free a group of hostages using a CD-launching gun alongside a cute wiener dog named Chorizo, you don\u2019t have to.Far Cry 6 is a compelling open-world action game from the early moments through the final confrontation.

But as I gaze out on the Yaran military base ahead of me, I know I'm not going to use any of those things. I'm going to pull out the suppressed rifle I got on the second mission of the game, complete with the first set of mods I made in the game's tutorial, and headshot each of the soldiers in turn until Far Cry 6 tells me I've successfully captured the base. I know this because I've done it so many times already in countless bases just like this and it works exceedingly well. Best of all, I can do it without thinking about all the other junk I'm lugging around--or worrying about that stupid crocodile catching someone's attention and blowing my cover.Far Cry games have long been gigantic open-world affairs, providing players with all sorts of things to do, from driving different vehicles to flying around with wingsuits to hunting animals to experiencing side missions. As revolutionary guerrilla Dani Rojas, all those options are available to you again in Far Cry 6--and more. In fact, the game is cluttered with systems, from base-building to weapon-modding to sending guerrilla teams on missions.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Far Cry 6 Video ReviewFar Cry 6 is overwhelmingly full of stuff. While a lot of its ideas seem interesting on paper, in practice, they're easily ignored. There's a whole lot to do, plan for, and keep in mind at any given time, and a large portion of it can feel superfluous and overbearing at best, repetitive and dull at worst.The framing conceit of Far Cry 6 is that you, Dani Rojas, are a super guerrilla fighter, perfectly suited to act as a near-one-person army in the battle to overthrow dictator Anton Castillo. The Caribbean nation of Yara is based pretty plainly on real-world Cuba in terms of its history and situation--it suffered from years of colonial exploitation, it saw a big socialist revolution in the 1960s, and large swathes of the country have fallen into poverty thanks to decades of economic sanctions by the US. But the story steps away from the real-world country and its attendant politics by imagining it falling to a new, fascist leader, one who exploits the nation's \"outcasts\" (who seem to basically be political dissidents and anyone the regime doesn't like) for slave labor to produce cancer wonder drug Viviro. Castillo got elected on the promise that Viviro would bring wealth back to Yara, but the reality is that he's hoarding all that wealth and that Viviro is made using a disastrously poisonous chemical that kills Yarans in droves.That setup basically acts to free you up to kill anybody with a military uniform, especially the Yaran leadership, who are known for their intense cruelty.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c193f85-49af-4d69-be29-1952a90c981d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c193f85-49af-4d69-be29-1952a90c981d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0d3b4c8-c557-43b2-8e10-867d526b66fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4fee54d2bc8294faca0ae57d4604c66bffc024154ea4803583dcf9d6a9a66dd"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a1aa015-3d99-4e19-97c1-f53c18eeb063", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b394a95649a26ab09bc93142fcbdc2ed7538bc97177ed0859a63ad3bc98b6e57"}}, "hash": "6e6221903cb7289101107c26a30833c2f2a4313445fffdcf37518e49e798436e", "text": "Outcasts forced to work in the Viviro fields are slaves who die from overwork or exposure to the Viviro poison, as well as fodder for medical experiments and victims of sadistic elites who murder them for sport.Returning Far Cry players will recognize the usual setup: A charismatic but obviously evil villain you love to hate (played brilliantly by Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito), and a cast of wacky characters who assist you in taking him down. Most of those characters just delight in the over-the-top warfare, and so the more pointed emotional moments Far Cry 6 tries to hit don't always really stick, although a few members of the cast are fleshed-out enough that when the war claims them in the narrative, you hate Castillo all the more for their loss. Generally, though, they exist mostly for comic relief, to be quirky as they explain how you're helping them make napalm or joke around about their love for a particularly battle-hardened tank.That creates a whole lot of tonal whiplash and ultimately undermines what seems to be the point of Far Cry 6, which is that fighting an overarching evil is easy, but building a nation and maintaining justice is hard. You spend a lot of time talking to Clara, the leader of your rebel group, who is pointed about the fact that the real war will start after Castillo is deposed, and she doesn't expect to live to see the better world she's hoping to create. Yara had its revolution before, and then it had another one, before the one you've helped kick off lately--and nobody's life is materially better than it used to be except for the strongmen who take advantage. The characters are aware that outside political influences, corporate interests, and those hungry for power are waiting in the wings for the shooting to stop.It's a bleak acknowledgment on top of a bleak premise, and a few times, Far Cry 6 really gets close to having something interesting to say. There's the corporate president who takes advantage of Yaran poverty to make billions off Viviro (he's Canadian, not American, somewhat shockingly), who your guerrilla mentor insists you spare so he can fund your revolution rather than the regime. There's the major, insistent implication that Castillo doesn't just target the poor and the political, but also LBGTQ+ people as well, as one character insists that even if he joins up in the battle against the regime and you win, he'll still be trans in Yara--and his revolution will continue, likely with a lot less support.And there's the repeated acknowledgment that Dani finds all this bloodshed to be great fun, stepping into the same meta territory explored in Far Cry 3, with a lot less to say about it. One side character even jokes that if you stop killing people for even a second, you'll immediately be crippled by post-traumatic stress disorder, so make sure you maintain your homicidal rampage. But the game never really wants to engage with any of these ideas too deeply, and even after you hit the credits, there's a live-game engine at work that'll keep you fighting the military week after week as they retake bases and checkpoints you've already liberated. Far Cry 6 might want to say something about something, but it's not sure what, and it never really finishes its point. When you finally hit the \"what now\" point of actually trying to make a free country out of Yara, Dani very pointedly just walks out of the room.Anyway, the usual Far Cry loop continues as you kindle the flames of revolution. You'll attack military checkpoints and bases and capture them for Libertad, your freedom fighter outfit, while completing story missions that are mostly about gathering more forces to Libertad's cause and taking out Castillo's lieutenants. The open-world map is littered with things to do along the way, and in order to build an arsenal of freedom-fighting gear, you'll need to stop frequently to seek out military caches to unlock new guns and Libertad caches that earn you clothes with perks for specific situations, like resisting poison or scavenging crafting materials.Early on, guerrilla mentor Juan Cortez tells you to make sure you bring \"the right tool for the right job,\" and that's central to what Far Cry 6 is pushing in its gameplay. The idea here is that you want to scan enemies ahead of a fight to find out what bullets are most effective against them and what weapons they have, and adjust your loadout.But there are a lot of guns, and a lot of mods, and a lot of clothes, to the point where customization often feels way too broad. In addition to guns you can modify yourself, there are also \"unique\" weapons you can find all over Yara that can't be modified, but which have special combinations of perks for specific uses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a1aa015-3d99-4e19-97c1-f53c18eeb063": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a1aa015-3d99-4e19-97c1-f53c18eeb063", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c193f85-49af-4d69-be29-1952a90c981d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e6221903cb7289101107c26a30833c2f2a4313445fffdcf37518e49e798436e"}, "3": {"node_id": "a7da9470-2a7f-4ab7-9853-7a7a557da973", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "72e994283cdc604d6574fa6120c46a3899cde15baabcef9b5030de8b5617fc5f"}}, "hash": "b394a95649a26ab09bc93142fcbdc2ed7538bc97177ed0859a63ad3bc98b6e57", "text": "And then there are Resolver weapons, which are similar to the cobbled-together weird weapons of Far Cry: New Dawn. One's a flamethrower, one's a harpoon gun that sticks people to walls, one's a sniper rifle that fires a big explosive round, and so on.Despite all those options, I found that the first rifle I got, with armor-piercing rounds that cut through Kevlar helmets and a crappy but workable suppressor, was effective through a vast majority of the game. Outside of the big fights of some story missions, a lot of the time, you can just sneak into a military location and headshot everyone with the same gun, especially because enemies are, by and large, pretty stupid. You have this whole mess of tools, but the pool of options is so big that the different guns can start to feel only slightly different, and the enemies and situations you find yourself in largely are very similar to one another and don't demand that much brainpower. Choices really just come down to what dumb combination of elements you want to bring into a fight--but if you want to avoid a fight, a series of sneaky headshots are easy enough to land.The overabundance of choices that saps their meaning extends to everything. Instead of a skill tree or abilities you can unlock, Dani can purchase Supremos, special backpacks that give them what is essentially an ultimate ability that charges up over time and as they rack up kills. Supremos include a missile battery, a thing that launches poison bombs, a jetpack that shoots a ring of fire around you, and a pack that gives you an instant self-revive if you should get too hurt. But really, the missile battery feels like the best choice in the vast majority of cases. You'll unlock a whole host of Supremos if you do the work to find the materials you need to purchase them, but you don't really need them--they're just another bunch of choices you can make as the fancy strikes you.The thing about Far Cry games is that they're best when situations devolve into ridiculous chaos, and the upshot of all those choices of weapons and gadgets and mods is that they can help make chaos happen in hilarious ways. The explosive Resolver sniper brings down helicopters in a snap, and they often crash into places where they blow up other soldiers or start fires. The missile battery will track a bunch of soldiers as they run around the battlefield, sending them flying in all directions. The poison turns enemies against each other to turn an approaching force into a discordant bunch of maddened allies. And lots of guns start fires, which will burn across fields and blow up tanks of Viviro poison to make for some great action movie moments.So when Far Cry 6 is firing on those cylinders, as you're grabbing a mounted gun and blasting attacking airplanes or shooting flaming holes in gasoline tanks to make them explode, it's a lot of fun. In fact, most of the story missions are pretty engaging, and doing things like airdropping onto a military ship and taking out its crew or setting a tobacco field on fire feel as good here as they have in past iterations of the game. The Far Cry formula works by and large, and the new additions to it offer some cool ways to make nonsense happen, like when you send a crocodile to tear off somebody's limbs or fire missiles from your backpack to take out a helicopter.The trouble is that there are so many things to do, find, gather, and use laid on top of and distracting from that core formula. Even after more than 30 hours and having worked through the entire story and most of the side missions, I've still got what feels like a ludicrous number of additional things to cross off my list. Co-op missions, weekly insurrection missions, treasure hunts, recruiting new Amigos, crafting more guns, buying more Supremos, adding more vehicles to my bases, chasing unique weapons, finding roosters for a cockfight minigame, fishing, hunting, gathering materials to upgrade my base structures--it all feels like so much more than necessary, gumming up the works of the fun element of getting into fights and setting things aflame.Far Cry 6 is often a fun game that feels like it's throwing everything at you, and if you want a heap of content, Far Cry 6 absolutely has you covered. In isolation, a lot of its elements are interesting ideas. Taken together, though, it feels like a lot of disparate things that keep taking your attention back to menus and map icons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7da9470-2a7f-4ab7-9853-7a7a557da973": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7da9470-2a7f-4ab7-9853-7a7a557da973", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a1aa015-3d99-4e19-97c1-f53c18eeb063", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b394a95649a26ab09bc93142fcbdc2ed7538bc97177ed0859a63ad3bc98b6e57"}, "3": {"node_id": "a007f2a9-e69c-4c55-a438-2b54722e6de5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb5d69e9f6e14391c425600fda8751a2837e1af4859cadbef89ff47f81b672e4"}}, "hash": "72e994283cdc604d6574fa6120c46a3899cde15baabcef9b5030de8b5617fc5f", "text": "It's a lot of exhausting extra stuff, when really, what Far Cry 6 is good at is giving me opportunities to blow stuff up.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:Ubisoft\u2019s newest open world is frozen in timeYara, the Cuba-inspired region in which Far Cry 6 takes place, is introduced as a \u201ctropical paradise frozen in time.\u201d Its people once raised arms to overthrow a dictator, but now, his son Ant\u00f3n Castillo (voiced by Afro-Italian actor Giancarlo Esposito) is following in his footsteps, deploying the military in every corner and disposing of anyone who isn\u2019t what he calls a \u201cTrue Yaran.\u201d History begins to repeat itself through abusive and exploitative practices, while the country burns and progress is measured in blood. And like its island setting, Far Cry 6 feels like history repeating itself \u2014 a perfect showcase for how Far Cry as a whole is frozen in time.Through the eyes of Dani Rojas (a character that can be either male or female), you take part in the fight against this new dictatorship, after Castillo apprehends and executes a group of Yarans fleeing for Miami. You survive, and agree to help the revolutionary group Libertad in exchange for another boat to the United States. But once the moment comes, you decide to stay and help, accepting the task of convincing three factions to join forces and take down Castillo.In classic Far Cry fashion, this means traveling through a massive open-world setting, taking on missions from each of these groups with objectives that Far Cry has leaned on hundreds of times before. You\u2019ll infiltrate camps and outposts, either by going full throttle or taking a stealthy approach; you\u2019ll use a flamethrower to burn down a plantation; you\u2019ll face waves of enemies as you wait for a progress bar to fill. It\u2019s a cycle that is entertaining to take part in during the first few hours. It\u2019s a foundation that has worked well ever since its implementation in Far Cry 3. But it gets old quickly. Enemies don\u2019t offer much variety, and encounters almost always end up with you destroying a tank or a helicopter as a climax.Past crafting-related activities, such as hunting animals, are still present, but they no longer feel like the central focus. Most of the crafting is done with materials lying around the world. They can be turned into weapon suppressors, sights, and different ammo types that dispatch certain enemies more easily. In practice, though, not having piercing rounds for an armored enemy isn\u2019t the end of the world, when explosives and other bombastic tools exist.Two such tools are the Supremo and your Amigos. The first is a backpack that deals an ultimate attack of sorts, ranging from EMP shockwaves to a flurry of rockets. The second is companions, another element we\u2019ve seen in previous Far Cry games. The crocodile Guapo is great for a full throttle approach, while the dog Chorizo will gladly distract enemies so you can finish them off with your machete. In my experience, however, combat scenarios are recycled so often that I was rarely challenged to change my tools and play style. So if these few additions don\u2019t do much, and the combat quickly falls into a repetitive cycle, what exactly is the main draw of Far Cry 6? The answer is Yara, for better or worse.As someone born in Argentina, I was intrigued, if not slightly worried, about how the game would portray a Latin American setting \u2014 specifically, one with a military dictatorship put front and center. Many countries, including Argentina and Cuba, have endured them in the past, and the scars exist to this day. Seeing Yarans under curfew, stopped on the roadside to show their papers, or even imprisoned in torture camps, hits close to home.I wasn\u2019t alive during the last dictatorship, which lasted from 1976 to 1983, but everyone from that time that I know personally, including my parents, has stories akin to these scenarios. My mom used to tell me about the military stopping my grandparents in the middle of the street to check their IDs, or the constant worry that soldiers could knock on anybody\u2019s door at any time looking for so-called subversives \u2014 anyone suspected of thinking differently from the military. University students and young people, in particular, were some of the main targets. Journalists were in the spotlight as well, and often \u201csilenced,\u201d a fact that\u2019s briefly touched upon during an early sequence in Far Cry 6.Unfortunately, Far Cry 6 continues the series\u2019 tiring tradition of presenting itself as political, on the surface, while fumbling any attempts at meaningful critique.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a007f2a9-e69c-4c55-a438-2b54722e6de5": {"__data__": {"id_": "a007f2a9-e69c-4c55-a438-2b54722e6de5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7da9470-2a7f-4ab7-9853-7a7a557da973", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "72e994283cdc604d6574fa6120c46a3899cde15baabcef9b5030de8b5617fc5f"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1cde1db-a3b3-435e-9964-95314155f44c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a8367b1df8be372c04ea4ebb97740701e3c172d958bb8fa93b3244811c2fe36"}}, "hash": "cb5d69e9f6e14391c425600fda8751a2837e1af4859cadbef89ff47f81b672e4", "text": "Like Far Cry 5, which postured itself as an exploration of white supremacy in the U.S. but fell flat in execution, Far Cry 6 is a game in which you rescue refugees by using a weapon that plays \u201cMacarena\u201d while you\u2019re aiming down its sights. The portrayal of Far Cry 6\u2019s guerrillas is similarly conflicting. The term guerrilla in itself is so overused between the characters in the game (\u201conce a guerrilla, always a guerrilla\u201d) that it becomes a catchphrase. The people you help also fall into tropes of Latin American characters: the sassy alcoholic know-it-all; a couple obsessed with sex (who are jokingly called \u201canimals\u201d); the veteran guerrillero who is constantly chanting \u201cviva la libertad.\u201d The bad stereotypes are abundant, and although I tried to overlook them, the game\u2019s dialogue does not help.Speaking of tropes (as I and other Latin American folks saw coming, since the game\u2019s reveal), Yara is a Spanish-native region that defaults to the English language, and more often than not, characters remind you of their nationality by switching between languages without any consistency. There are sequences where two characters speak entirely in Spanish for a few seconds (one standout being a song that is fully captioned in English during a cutscene), then quickly go back to a mashup \u2014 the same ones seen recently in other AAA games such as The Last of Us: Part 2 and Cyberpunk 2077.It\u2019s been said a number of times, but when Spanish-speaking people are talking in English, we\u2019re not constantly cambiando a Espa\u00f1ol mid-sentence. Far Cry 6 is obsessed with this fallacy. It comes across as parody at best, and utterly disrespectful at worst. Castillo quotes his father at one point, saying, \u201cJes\u00fas would make an amazing Yaran presidente.\u201d When I heard that, I got fairly close to putting the controller down and calling it a day. I stuck with the game long enough to see the end credits, but unfortunately, the rest of the game did not remedy any of this.What bothers me the most is the wasted potential to do it right. Proper Latin American representation in games is severely lacking, but 2021 in particular has been a standout in both extremes. I found Hitman 3\u2019s representation of Mendoza to be a pleasant surprise on almost every front, while the first Argentine operator in Rainbow Six Siege sounded nothing like us. Far Cry 6 paints a hopeful picture at times, as every sign in the game \u2014 and all of the graffiti \u2014 is written in Spanish. Recognizing songs on the radio, and even hearing Dani sing over them, made me stop for a second in delight and surprise. But as soon as a character began speaking, the moment was ruined.For a Spanish-native setting, Yara is a vast, sprawling, beautiful island, and on more than one occasion, I parked my car to take a screenshot of the sunset illuminating a nearby coast. Yet it is a world built by a conglomeration of studios at which workers have described experiencing abuse, harassment, workplace misconduct, toxic leaders, and racial pay disparities, and neither empty promises nor leadership changes seem likely to fix those systemic problems. As Castillo himself says, if the guerrillas manage to reclaim Yara, what will they do with an island already set in flames? Far Cry as a whole is frozen in time. The few mechanical additions in the series\u2019 latest entry don\u2019t show much improvement over what Far Cry 5 or Far Cry New Dawn have already explored. And if your interest lies in the search for any semblance of proper representation, you\u2019re better off looking elsewhere. Very few examples, in recent years, have been able to shake the norm. And if Far Cry 6 is any indication of what AAA publishers can do with a Latin American setting \u2014 painting it more as window dressing than an actual picture worth celebrating \u2014 I would rather not see another one try.

There\u2019s normally very little standing in the way of fun, especially when a co-op buddy joins the fight. However, while Far Cry 6 does have the staple arsenal of guns, open world, big villain, and full-featured co-op, this installment disappointingly fails to evolve the series in any meaningful way.Far Cry 6 puts players in the shoes of a bloodthirsty modern-day guerrilla fighter going up against the dictator in charge of Yara, a fictional Caribbean island. The dictator, Ant\u00f3n Castillo, is played by Giancarlo Esposito who, once he starts appearing more frequently at about five hours in, is fantastic. His performance here almost matches the intensity of Breaking Bad\u2019s Gus, his star-making role, and he is a real treat to watch.The rest of the cast is good, too, with Yara\u2019s populace boasting a lot of variety and vibrancy in its characters, even if this also has the unfortunate side-effect of filing down the edges of its dark story. The levity resulting from the constant jokes and banter was too much for me, ultimately undermining the overarching plot. It\u2019s a shame as Ant\u00f3n and his son Diego do experience some interesting developments, but there\u2019s no big payoff.Far Cry 6\u2019s map is massive. When you complete the prologue and escape the initial island, it\u2019s overwhelming just how much space becomes accessible to you. You\u2019re given three missions to start in any order and then sent on your way.Traversing the map is initially done by vehicle or horseback. I eventually opted for the latter, as vehicles get their tires spiked at enemy checkpoints. Later, I got a helicopter, which is shot down by enemy anti-air guns. There are side mission activities to take the checkpoints for yourself and destroy the AA guns, but I\u2019m not a fan of having to divert from the main mission path, especially for the same repetitive task. I eventually learned that I could just spawn in mid-air at a fast travel point and skydive to each new mission to save time.Once you get to the mission marker, it\u2019s time to sneak around for a bit before \u201cgoing loud\u201d and laying waste with your arsenal of weapons. Far Cry 6 does an excellent job in this department, with plenty of guns to unlock and customize with various attachments. I was regularly switching out newly-unlocked guns and they all felt great to use.However, the Rock, Paper, Scissors ammo type system puts a major downer on things. Having to match up an ammo type against the enemy you are facing just isn\u2019t a fun mechanic. It slows the pacing all the way down, with enemies transforming into sponges, and feels like a feature that was implemented for the sake of it. Combine this with the seemingly unimproved AI and there\u2019s little satisfaction in taking soldiers down.What should be the stars of the show in gameplay are the Supremo abilities and Resolver weapons. Supremos are extraordinarily powerful weapons contained in the player\u2019s backpack. They can be made to fire a barrage of auto-targeting missiles, filled with a drug that causes the player to be faster and get an unstoppable melee attack, send out a big burst of energy, and more. It\u2019s enormous fun!The Resolver weapons are homemade guns that can be tremendously powerful. The nailgun returns here and is great for stealth, while the fireworks rocket launcher comes in handy for dealing with helicopters and tanks. It\u2019s just a shame that these weapons didn\u2019t feature more in the main story, as I feel like unlocking them through main missions would have really spiced things up, but they\u2019re instead locked behind a currency earned through side missions.Another highlight to the gameplay is the Amigos system. These are animal companions who will assist you on missions. They can distract or take down a few enemies for you, which can be useful in the earlier stages of the game. However, while I loved having these good boys around, especially Chorizo the dachshund, I found myself forgetting about them during later missions. It\u2019s also pretty sloppy how the Amigos suddenly move at high speed to keep up to you while driving or sailing around.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d13b4f5-2a5c-4225-b4b1-05aec193c802": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d13b4f5-2a5c-4225-b4b1-05aec193c802", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1cde1db-a3b3-435e-9964-95314155f44c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a8367b1df8be372c04ea4ebb97740701e3c172d958bb8fa93b3244811c2fe36"}, "3": {"node_id": "9bd68fd7-813a-4df0-8f15-02703d0fb81a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bdcbb519c74862ec654d725d53b5d223cd3d380fe235912434e91aa967f9de7b"}}, "hash": "b4301bc1b454494a0770e6350fa5eec05a361ada4fdc3e840734008fb0371b64", "text": "Seeing Guapo the Alligator Usain Bolting it to keep up with my car had me in tears. Funny, but sloppy.Far Cry 6 is made for co-op, incorporating the same drop-in drop-out system that we saw in Far Cry 5. If you can get a buddy to fill in the downtime traveling between missions, and also while completing the more tedious objectives, then you\u2019ll enjoy FC6 a lot more. The game appears easier in co-op, too, which is helpful for those making a beeline straight through the main missions to the ending, before potentially going back and trying out some side content.Having decided to focus on the main missions before tackling other diversions, I found myself encountering a \u201cRank up to stand up to STRONGER soldiers\u201d message. I initially balked at the hint, thinking back to the Assassin\u2019s Creed games that forced me to complete side quests so I could rank up for the next main mission, but changing weapons and ammo types allowed me passage through the remainder of the game.It took me 15 hours in total to beat the campaign, but for those players who have the patience to pick up every bit of scrap and take out every single enemy, doing more than the occasional side mission, and traveling less optimally between missions, I can see Far Cry 6 taking the average player 18-20 hours to beat. There is an easier mode available, which I think many will opt for given how annoying the new ammo mechanics are, which will no doubt make for a shorter adventure.Far Cry 6\u2019s side missions are all about quantity rather than quality, which is something that most Ubisoft fans will now expect. Populating a massive map with an outrageous number of markers is expected and I imagine fans would be shocked by a tighter, more refined experience. There\u2019s a ridiculous amount of things to do, most of which aren\u2019t memorable or are memorable for the wrong reasons, like the cockfighting activity which puts a \u201cfun\u201d spin on animal cruelty by parodying an arcade fighting game.There\u2019s a lot of side content that could have just been cut and the rewards instead provided during the main campaign, to help evolve the gameplay at a more rapid pace. That would have made the rather basic mission structure more fun with new toys to play with. There\u2019s a lot of filler content and it\u2019s just not compelling.Playing on PS5, I was extremely glad to see that 60 FPS had been prioritized. It\u2019s smooth like butter, except when things get super explosive and during cutscenes. I\u2019m glad Ubisoft did this, but the bump up from 30 FPS to 60 FPS does come at a perceptible cost. Dynamic resolution appears to be in effect here, with scenes shifting from sharp to blurry to help provide a consistent 60 FPS. There are moments where Far Cry 6 looks awesome and I happily snapped a screenshot or two, but there are also times when the screen looked as though it had been smeared in grease.Far Cry 6 had the potential to deliver an interesting story, solid gameplay, a great next-gen presentation, and a fantastic co-op experience. While it succeeds with the latter, the story feels hollow with a setting that\u2019s handled clumsily, the gameplay is hampered by unnecessary hindrances weighing down the fundamentals, and the visuals get a little too blurry to consistently impress on this new Sony system.Unfortunately, Far Cry 6 has missed the mark again, with too few significant improvements and a lot of bloat. For those who love Far Cry, it\u2019s yet another game to blast through and add to the pile, but compared to the competition, this series is starting to fall seriously behind.Far Cry 6 was reviewed on PS5 with code provided by the publisher.7Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

We like to rank this stuff, again and again, to the point that we talk in circles.

These games sell; they\u2019re pretty well-liked. As someone who can only handle keeping up with one open-world Ubisoft series at the expense of all the others, for me, it\u2019s Far Cry \u2014 no question.I just wish I didn\u2019t feel the weight of that formula quite so much while I played.Far Cry 6 (PS5 [reviewed], PS4, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S) Developer: Ubisoft Publisher: Ubisoft Released: October 7, 2021 MSRP: $59.99 Far Cry 6 is a very fun game in which you, playing as a voiced protagonist with an honest-to-goodness personality for once, tear up a gorgeous (Cuba-inspired but fictional) Caribbean island just as the latest revolution is about to boil over. After attempting to escape for a better life in Miami, Dani Rojas kinda sorta reluctantly joins the guerrillas in hopes of uniting three different regional factions under the wider Libertad movement.Far Cry 6 is also a very familiar game \u2014 so familiar, in fact, that it can be distracting.If you\u2019ve played any of the recent Far Crys and you know a one-sentence summary about the plot \u2014 which tries to juggle care-free open-world antics and heavy real-world themes like \u201cfake\u201d citizens who are forced to work in labor camps \u2014 then you know what to expect. Genuinely. There will be few, if any, surprising moments \u2014 in the story or the gameplay. Now, that isn\u2019t an inherently bad thing, especially with some refinements in the mix, it\u2019s just worth stressing upfront. If you aren\u2019t in the mood for another Far Cry, then do not expect to want to finish this game. It\u2019s not short, and it sure isn\u2019t groundbreaking.The main change feels like it\u2019s a course correction from Far Cry 5, which took some bolder risks that ended up annoying a lot of players. People really didn\u2019t like being interrupted or captured while they roamed Montana, and there\u2019s nothing of the sort in Far Cry 6. The game goes out of its way to let you run wild and chart your course across this island nation. I can see why Ubisoft leaned heavily into this \u201cunrestricted\u201d direction, and I bet a significant number of Far Cry fans will dig it \u2014 but I also think there are trade-offs.Aside from Dani, who can be male or female (though I recommend the latter choice for her great VO), there are a handful of other characters who are worth taking seriously.Most notably, there\u2019s the fierce dictator of Yara, Ant\u00f3n Castillo (played by Giancarlo Esposito), and his well-meaning son Diego, a president-in-training who\u2019s far less dogmatic. Their family dynamic is explored in far-off cutscenes throughout Far Cry 6 as well as in a few, but not too many, face-to-face encounters. I felt a believable tension in the room with those two. I mean, I had guesses about how a Far Cry game would likely end, but I wanted to see how Dani wound up there. The journey itself was hit-or-miss.Almost everyone else \u2014 from zany side characters you\u2019ll recruit to fascist underlings you\u2019ll wipe off the map \u2014 comes across as pure Far Cry fodder. You know the kind. You know how these characters tend to be written. I\u2019d say that Far Cry 6 goes even more over-the-top with some of its big personalities, to the point where it took me a few hours to acclimate to the arguably too-playful tone. I eventually came around on people like Juan Cortez, a world-weary \u201cguerrilla master\u201d who outfits Dani with slapdash weaponry including a rocket-firing backpack, and El Tigre, a revolutionary legend with big dad energy who takes an immediate liking to Dani and adorably refers to her as Beb\u00e9 Tigre.The rest of \u2019em? Well, they won\u2019t get in your way too much. In fact, Far Cry 6 really tries to streamline the way quest-givers dole out information. Main quests have a spoken intro that you can skip right over in a Destiny-style screen with a virtual cursor, which is great, because there are 50-some story missions.

You do not have a skill tree in this game, which I think is for the best at this point. Dani will acquire tools like the fishing pole and the wingsuit early on without any fuss, and perks are tied to pieces of gear like gloves, helmets, and pants.After clearing Far Cry 6\u2018s introductory island, you\u2019ll head off to the main landmass. Yara is made up of three huge zones (each with a group to recruit for Libertad), as well as a fortified city center, and everything is further split up into smaller districts. As you chip away at military checkpoints, outposts, and other activities, Dani will level up, and the threat level in these different districts will also rise. Not every zone is the same \u2014 and at a certain point, your arsenal will feel unstoppable against even the most armored soldiers \u2014 but that\u2019s the basic format.

I saw a number associated with my gear pieces and my guns, and I didn\u2019t like the idea that they\u2019d potentially become disposable in an endless power-level grind. In reality, Far Cry 6 doesn\u2019t work that way at all. With enough accumulated resources, you can bulk up the lowliest weapons with scopes, silencers, and other wide-ranging benefits, so nothing feels like a waste if you don\u2019t want it to be. Customization, in general, is a huge focus in this game. For instance, I have a perk where, once I reload a certain handgun, all of my weapons are also magically reloaded \u2014 a slick solution to the grenade launcher\u2019s elaborate reload animation.For players who just want to get on with the skirmishes and not worry about picking up too many resources, during your Yaran adventures, you\u2019ll organically get some unique weapons that come with bells and whistles all ready to go. I used a mix of these turnkey weapons and my own fine-tuned creations. There\u2019s also an on-demand weaponized car that you can deck out, but honestly, this is Far Cry \u2014 I mainly tried to clear out military targets to open up fast-travel air-drops on the map. If I wasn\u2019t gliding to my next waypoint with a wingsuit, I was calling in a horse. They\u2019re a lot of fun to ride, and they suit the uneven terrain, whereas vehicles can be a little dicey. On PlayStation 5, you will ~feel the horse~. Anyone who has picked up a DualSense controller will know what I mean by that.Even though there are considerations for ammo types when you\u2019re facing certain foes with such-and-such weaknesses, I should say that the progression doesn\u2019t come across as a slog, and I didn\u2019t feel like the difficulty was artificially inflated (outside of a couple of weirdly tough moments, like a chase scene on the back of a fleeing truck). You should ideally be picking up bits of scrap metal, medicine, and gasoline after you clear out an area, because that all goes toward upgrades at your three main bases, so keep that in mind. Eventually, over time, it can be a chore to hold the Square button to grab all of this stuff.It\u2019s ultimately worth doing, though. There are six structures to build at the different guerrilla HQs, and they have a wider impact on gameplay, whether you\u2019re a fishing pro, a hunter, a chef who wants to cook up limited-time buffs, or you just want to get around the map more conveniently. There are other diversions at camp like choose-your-own-adventure missions that can earn you resources in the background if you pick the right Bandido leader for the right task, and, no joke, there\u2019s a full-on 3D fighter mini-game with chickens. Yes, it has a roster with unlockable roosters.

And strangely fun.Animal buddies return, including a croc with a shirt and an oh-so-tiny dog who can catch enemies off-guard with weaponized cuteness. Again, you know the game-design drill.At the end of the day, headshots and stealth still matter most. A well-aimed arrow is often devastating, and for better or worse, my good but by no means maxed-out bow was my weapon of choice in Far Cry 6. Same as it ever was. Maybe I\u2019m boring, but I also ended up sticking with what is essentially the default Supremo backpack \u2014 the one that fires just enough homing rockets to take down a helicopter. While other options, like healing, seemed interesting for a co-op build, I just felt most comfortable with this basic yet effective \u201cultimate.\u201d I found my strategy and it consistently worked; that\u2019s the Far Cry way.Any technical mishaps? I noticed several instances of short-lived screen tearing, and a bit of weird framey-ness in some cutscenes, but otherwise, the performance was great on PS5. The lighting and foliage can really hit the spot depending on the time of day.At the risk of starting to ramble, which is always a concern when it comes to these sprawled-out Ubisoft games, I should wrap up this review. I can\u2019t cover every facet.I spent around 25 hours finishing Far Cry 6\u2018s main campaign, with some distractions here and there, and then I spent at least another five hours on slightly more cerebral treasure hunts, assorted Yaran Stories (side-quests), and yeah, I couldn\u2019t help but capture more of those military outposts on the map. Overall, I had a good time \u2014 I had a fun time! \u2014 but so much of this game feels so familiar, to a fault. And it didn\u2019t make a strong first impression, either. Even though it fell short in other ways, and it lost steam, I feel like Far Cry 5 spoiled me with its tense intro, more interesting cult setup, and that unforgettable soundtrack. I still think about the serene loading-screen tunes and map music to this day.As someone who has played all of these games, this is probably the least motivated I\u2019ve felt to fully \u201cfinish\u201d a Far Cry. You might feel the same way. You might totally disagree. The high point is definitely Dani Rojas, who steals the show, and I can\u2019t see Ubisoft going back to another silent protagonist. She truly fits the tone of this game and this series.In a vacuum, Far Cry 6 is a great open-world action romp, and I should love it without caveats. Plenty of fans will. But when we\u2019ve seen these same old tricks so many times before, year after year, and the new story mostly lacks nuance or even just high stakes, it\u2019s tough to get excited about another checklist no matter where it\u2019s set or who you\u2019re fighting alongside. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was in a sandbox; the illusion broke.I\u2019m in a tricky position where that deflated feeling is probably partially on me, the player, and partially on Far Cry as a series that keeps returning to the same well. The refinements are appreciated. The reliable gunplay \u2014 and the even greater ease with which you can get around and fight without being bogged down \u2014 go a long way in Far Cry 6. I have to give props there. And while I wasn\u2019t able to test co-op, that\u2019s going to be a bigger draw this time, and might be the ideal way to play. It\u2019s supposed to be a thrill ride, after all.If Far Cry 3 was the last game you really got into, or the modern Far Cry formula is your meaty open-world experience of choice that somehow never loses its potency, you\u2019ll find a lot of comfort in Far Cry 6. Otherwise, get to it when you get to it, and try not to burn out.\u00a0[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience.

Ten minutes into Far Cry 6, you feel like the franchise has finally taken the huge leap it needed to.\u00a0However, once you\u2019ve learned its new quirks, come to terms with its sheer scale, and fully settled into the action, this latest installment feels more or less the same as every other modern Far Cry game, albeit with a super-sized helping of Ubisoft hallmarks.Oh well. At least it\u2019s still a lot of fun, even if it\u2019s for most of the same reasons.As with Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla and Watch Dogs Legion, Ubisoft has stamped its first next-gen Far Cry with its emblematic traits: an overwhelmingly huge map, a ridiculous number of collectibles, a wealth of side quests, a suite of new upgrade systems, an odd, cursor-based menu, and more modes than you can shake a garishly modified, military-grade grenade launcher at. Occasionally, and for no reason whatsoever, it even forces a third-person camera mode on you. Good old Ubi.Yet with this incredible explosion in size, scale, and... well, stuff, Far Cry 6 loses some of the charm and immersion that its simpler predecessors had in spades.Ubisoft\u2019s clear desire to create the biggest and most comprehensive gaming experience in Far Cry\u2019s storied history is admirable in principle and largely successful overall, but aside from the core theme of its story, Far Cry 6 doesn\u2019t showcase a revolution.The Far Cry series has its name for a reason: between Africa, the Indo-Pacific, the Himalayas, and Montana, it traditionally focuses on low-population areas filled with dramatic landscapes, villages, and hidden wonders. It\u2019s therefore quite a culture shock when Far Cry 6 drops you in a bustling cityscape from minute one.Following a stunning introduction, you\u2019re immediately thrust into the heart of Esperanza, the capital of brutal urban dystopia Yara\u2013a country clearly based on Cuba, thanks to its failed former ties with the Soviet Union and America (A.K.A. the \u201cYanquis\u201d), and its subsequent transformation into a one-party dictatorship under the idealistic but brutal tenure of Anton Castillo, played by the scene-stealing Giancarlo Esposito.Luckily, Yara found incredible fortune by creating Viviro, a cancer-treating drug derived from tobacco. However, people are needed to grow it using horrific poison, dying in the process. Your journey as the fully-voiced, male-or-female army dropout Dani Rojas begins as you and hundreds of others are chosen by the junta to die on plantations, or in cold blood on the street. It\u2019s the grimmest start to a Far Cry yet, and it\u2019s delivered with aplomb.As is always the way, you manage to evade capture, though your escape inevitably results in your barely fleshed-out friends being killed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b9efa3c-42cf-41df-b49b-4a97f8e8cec7": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b9efa3c-42cf-41df-b49b-4a97f8e8cec7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "bbc5863e-ead5-4434-bb15-6afb810ea1cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "69351228e4aa28a055602496e5fe8c2e12eacb837ebeb524188222d9747d1e1f"}, "3": {"node_id": "444fd72d-f7de-4fab-8b2b-c7cbc3e9ee9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "270a9620637b29a46868b058f9d24d32011a3901c606295b9d68c29ab296f60f"}}, "hash": "bda00d0a0dca7e2d8f4f67da2109898a6d002a32b9313c623baa0c3daee19b94", "text": "Naturally, evil figurehead Castillo is improbably yet delightfully placed at the very front and center of these deaths. Soon, you\u2019re dumped on an underpopulated tropical paradise to start afresh and lead the fight.So far, so Far Cry. It\u2019s lip service to fans, something underlined by an early mission where you burn crops with a flamethrower. You half-expect Skrillex ft. Damian Marley to start playing again; Dani herself says it \u201cfeels familiar.\u201d Absolute megalols.Far Cry 6 is all about the red fog of war.In a two-hour spell, you transform from a universally loathed have-a-go hero and into freedom fighter Clara Garcia\u2019s prized guerrilla. You escape to the mainland, and the map is finally unveiled. Good lord, it\u2019s absolutely huge.Far Cry 6\u2019s landscape must be more than twice the size of Far Cry 5. To match its massive map, there are over 80 or so land, sea, and air vehicles (including horses, finally! Horses are vehicles). While the story lightly encourages you to start in the west, you can begin your quest wherever you want, but don\u2019t go flying too early\u2013flak cannons will shoot you down until you take them out.In its desire to showcase all those shiny new ideas, Far Cry 6 puts its story on the backburner to deluge you with tutorials for countless new modes, upgrades, and abilities. While there are a lot of good ideas in there, it soon becomes apparent that Far Cry 6 has way too much going on.Each district has a central hub you work from, where you develop your resistance, unlock new abilities, upgrade your weapons, and deposit or pick up your vehicles. The age-old art of base-taking has been shaken up; while some still appear on the map with those all-telling smoke plumes, they\u2019re pared back and joined by checkpoints and hideouts, which bring more restrictive benefits and rewards, though don\u2019t lose those all-important fast travel and air-drop points.All these bells and whistles come with a raft of new currencies, which are literally strewn across the landscape. While you now thankfully only have to run over the bodies of the fallen to reap their ammo and cash, you instead have to repeatedly hold the action button to collect a plethora of camp resources (gasoline, metal, medicine), crafting materials (parts, scraps, Supremo-Bond, gunpowder), tradable items (animal pelts and meat), and then some.\u00a0The sheer number of items and management situations is immense, though they fit the \u201cwaste not, want not\u201d mentality of guerrilla fighting. Love them or hate them, you soon learn to put them to the back of your mind. If you\u2019re chasing progress and story development, chances are you\u2019ll spend, trade, or upgrade once every five hours or so, by which point you\u2019ll always have an abundance of materials and cash to use.\u00a0After all, there\u2019s just so much to see, do, and kill.Far Cry 6 makes a big deal about its new approach to combat, which takes a lot of its cues from guerrilla fighting. Still, it\u2019s more variation than innovation.There are well over 90 guns to find or buy, but in keeping with its partisan aesthetic, there\u2019s a huge emphasis on homemade weapons\u2013so-called \u201cResolver\u201d contraptions (Spanish for \u201csort out\u201d), which add real DIY flair to proceedings. Alongside often crazy creations, there are also practical issues to consider, such as overheating suppressors; no longer can you spray bullets in constant silence.Far Cry 6's weapons are endlessly customizable.Clothing is no longer cosmetic, and instead delivers different forms of protection or buffs. The only time this ever feels important is after you die from, say, a tank shell to the face. Once you die, the game unhelpfully reminds you to wear some blast-proof trousers to avoid dying so quickly from, you know, a tank shell to the face\u2013said trousers that aren\u2019t as effective against the soft-target rounds of the 15 troops also shooting you, or the armor-piercing bullets from the helicopter overhead.The maddest addition to Far Cry 6\u2019s arsenal is your Supremo: a backpack that can shower the battlefield with bombs, or heal you and your allies, while also acting as a hub for your preferred throwables.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "444fd72d-f7de-4fab-8b2b-c7cbc3e9ee9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "444fd72d-f7de-4fab-8b2b-c7cbc3e9ee9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b9efa3c-42cf-41df-b49b-4a97f8e8cec7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bda00d0a0dca7e2d8f4f67da2109898a6d002a32b9313c623baa0c3daee19b94"}, "3": {"node_id": "da1adaf6-6c32-4059-9c7b-9c479048c4a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2935336b0fa9571b97020742065448fe43a3723a06a60c5bea96507b7070ddb3"}}, "hash": "270a9620637b29a46868b058f9d24d32011a3901c606295b9d68c29ab296f60f", "text": "Think of it as a special move\u2013one that never seems available when you need it most, and something you routinely forget even exists.Whatever your chosen loadout, Far Cry 6\u2019s combat only ever seems to play out in one of two ways: you\u2019re either running rampant without breaking a sweat, or you fall victim to its weird, inconsistent, and rather cynical enemy mechanics.With the bare minimum of stealth, you can wipe out a squad of five elite soldiers with relative ease, even if they\u2019re all looking at each other. Considering this is the first game in the series where you\u2019re fighting a trained military, Far Cry 6\u2019s AI is shockingly slow. After discovering you, soldiers motionlessly gawp at you for a second or two, giving you plenty of time to line up your sights and get an easy headshot. And then another. And another.Conversely, the red miasma that shows yet-undetected enemies on your radar can be endless. Situations flip from a walk in the park to disastrous, as baddies swarm at random, occasionally popping up on your radar from literally nowhere. You can cleanse entire sections of a military marina or plantation, only to go back to the same area two minutes later to see the exact same soldiers stood in the same place, running the same routines. It\u2019s truly bizarre.This problem is most keenly felt in boss fights and urban settings. One notable key story mission in Esperanza initially seems like a Dishonored-style negotiation of carefully positioned troops\u2013you can sneak past, or take them out. However, it soon becomes obvious that Far Cry 6 is pushing you to get to your target destination as quickly as possible, as it just keeps throwing tons of soldiers at you. Hide and they\u2019ll find you; stand and fight and you\u2019ll get swarmed, or run out of ammo.Once you figure out the game\u2019s foibles, these highs and lows work together to create a truly unique experience\u2013one that makes Far Crys past look pretty damn dull. It\u2019s an issue reflective of the game\u2019s story: an inconsistent rollercoaster of highs and lows that somehow manages to create something incomparable to its predecessors, for better and worse.Far Cry 6 has a real problem with its tone. Rattling between two extremes, it never quite finds a consistent level; you won\u2019t find any real nuance between its dichotomy of resolute anger and absolute madness.WHO'S A GOOD BOYIn the earliest moments of the game, you see people being executed for just being in the wrong place at the wrong time; flamethrower-wielding troops are burning bodies; men, women, and children are running for their lives while friends and family are culled around them. An hour later, you see an alcoholic former guerrilla order his T-shirt-wearing pet crocodile to death-roll an advancing soldier.\u00a0Sure, brutality and hilarity have often gone hand in hand in past Far Cry games, but this sixth installment only seems to have one or the other at any one time.Aside from the wonderfully dramatic writing for the characters of Castillo and Espada Montero, A.K.A. Lara Croft But Angry, stand-out performances are somewhat limited to comic stars like Juan \u201cPTSD for everyone!\u201d Cortez\u2013Ernest Hemingway in all but profession\u2013alongside aging rebel El Tigre, the frankly unhinged Philly, and the genuinely delightful Jonr\u00f3n. And, of course, Chorizo the dog really is a very good boy, even if his squeaky wheels make him intolerable as a companion.Whether purposeful or via Stockholm syndrome, this binary storytelling ends up becoming Far Cry 6\u2019s weirdest draw. While the acting talent often feels either too serious or ridiculous, major players bounce off one another and weave in and around what is arguably the most fleshed out and realistic tale in the series, complete with those trademark twists and turns.

It\u2019s not a mockery of bloodsports; it\u2019s not a sideways exploration of culture; it\u2019s not an artistic criticism of animal abuse; it\u2019s not even a skilled minigame. You wouldn\u2019t make one about dogfighting, so why this? What does it add?Despite these grotesquely confounding moments, Far Cry 6 can be an incredibly beautiful game. It\u2019s no great leap forward from FC5, but cutscenes are sharp and atmospheric, emotions are conveyed better than ever, and Yara may well be the most beautiful and colorful land out there, should you discount New Dawn\u2019s obsession with neon paint.\u00a0The game\u2019s beauty is undoubtedly enhanced by Ubisoft\u2019s incredible photo mode, which has to be the best of its kind in gaming right now. From wholesale time-of-day changes and weather toggling through to facial expressions and unrivaled manipulation of aperture and field of vision, it\u2019s a standard-bearer in the industry and gets every drop out of its endless stunning vistas.While we\u2019re talking about top-quality work from Ubisoft, its approach to accessibility seems to get better with every game. The robotic voiceover now omnipresent during every Ubi game\u2019s initial boot-up signals its admirable commitment to inclusivity, and even though none of the options apply to me (aside from my rampant love of tiny subtitles), its suite of accessibility tools seems to improve by the year. Cap doffed.Photo mode never gets boring - it's a game in itself.At its heart, Far Cry 6 is an extension and expansion of its forefathers, for both better and worse. If you\u2019re a die-hard FC fan, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019ll bloody love it, even if it can feel too big. If you don\u2019t like what\u2019s come before, it won\u2019t give you anything to suddenly evoke an epiphany and fall in love with its charms.Yes, its AI is slow and a bit stupid. Its driving and flying mechanics are dated. Those all-new ideas just don\u2019t quite land. Its UI seems getting more confusing with every new game. But Far Cry 6 is definitely the most fun I\u2019ve had from the series since the delightful Far Cry 3\u2013even if everything seems to hinge on extremes, and rely on old tricks.Disclaimer: I was provided with a copy of Far Cry 6 in exchange for a fair and honest review. The game was tested on Xbox Series X.\nShacknews, New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowFar Cry 6 takes some impressive leaps forward but struggles to maintain focus at times.To the surprise of nobody, Far Cry 6 is a huge game. There are endless sights to see and things to do, but some activities don\u2019t live up to expectations. One of its greatest strengths thus becomes a weakness at times. Thankfully, what Far Cry 6 gets right outweighs the instances where it falls short.Far Cry 6 begins with an introduction to the main character, Dani, as well as Dani\u2019s two friends, Lita and Alejo. The group is having a couple of drinks on a rooftop when soldiers move in and round people up for the Draft to Paradise, an \"opportunity\" to work for a better Yara, a country that\u2019s struggling with crippling poverty. Yara's dictator, Anton Castillo, is not afraid to make tough choices that he believes are necessary to get the country back on track.It\u2019s here that you will select between a female or male character, both uniquely voiced, providing a full narrative experience regardless of who is chosen. Once you make a choice, bullets begin to fly. You are forced to sneak, run, jump, and generally parkour over balconies and through streets to escape death. It\u2019s an impressive bit of gameplay to kick things off, and soon Dani gets to meet Anton Castillo and his son Diego face to face. As is often the case early in a story, this first meeting doesn\u2019t go well for the main character.Soon after this meeting, you're introduced to the guerrilla organization known as Libertad. A group that is pushing back against Castillo\u2019s regime.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f593a823-dca4-4f83-a49d-3a6e8b09e05e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f593a823-dca4-4f83-a49d-3a6e8b09e05e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "da1adaf6-6c32-4059-9c7b-9c479048c4a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2935336b0fa9571b97020742065448fe43a3723a06a60c5bea96507b7070ddb3"}, "3": {"node_id": "47165936-2867-44bc-befa-3c3b88cd70bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "217d37ddd63e73103f5abb7655b8cfae65c12a8572caae53fa6663b4731abc1c"}}, "hash": "e0fb193d726e3a2fa63537b0b1d180eb3caeb51f0b37c558cc46b1fb6a475d3b", "text": "A group that is pushing back against Castillo\u2019s regime. While it\u2019s clear early on that they are a thorn in Castillo\u2019s side, they desperately need a hero, which is where you come in. The group\u2019s leader, Clara, will ask you to fight back against Castillo\u2019s forces and recruit key figures to increase the strength and capabilities of Libertad. With that, the stage for Far Cry 6 is set and you are (sort of) free to explore the vast country of Yara.Once you're loose in Yara, a major strength is immediately clear. Far Cry 6 is one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played. I was able to run it at a resolution of 2560x1440 (2K) with most settings cranked and the HD texture pack installed. The result is a world filled with beautiful mountains, forests, beaches, cities, and tucked away areas to explore. There aren't a lot of quiet moments in Far Cry 6, but when there are, you'd be wise to take a moment to enjoy the view.My first walkabout in Far Cry 6 featured plenty to sink my teeth into. First, I noticed the guerrilla paths that allow travel without being confronted by enemies constantly. Along those paths are various Libertad NPCs that will offer tidbits of information you can use, as well as hideouts and workbenches. It\u2019s never too far to the next car, boat, horse, plane, or helicopter, so if walking isn\u2019t ideal, you can grab a ride to the next destination.Around this time is also when I noticed that I couldn\u2019t see enemies as well as I expected. I\u2019m color blind, but Far Cry 6 is packed with accessibility options ranging from menu narration to outlined enemies to choices in difficulty. These options are presented as the game launches, so those that need some or all of the options can tweak them right out of the gate, which I thought was a fantastic move by Ubisoft.Traversing Yara in any vehicle is enjoyable, whether it\u2019s gliding across the water in a boat, flying over the vast mountains, or bombing down the highway in one of the cars (rides) with the radio cranked. It cannot be stated enough that Far Cry 6 is breathtaking. This is furthered by a strong collection of music that can be enjoyed by turning the radio on in any vehicle found in the world. If what\u2019s playing is particularly good, you might hear Dani singing along.The pain point I foresee with vehicles is the first-person only perspective. The option to drive any vehicle in third-person doesn\u2019t exist in Far Cry 6. At first, I thought this was a terrible choice, but the more I fly or drive, the more I appreciate it. While I expect that stance won\u2019t be shared by many, I\u2019ve often criticized Ubisoft for trying to be everything to everyone. There\u2019s lots of that in Far Cry 6, but first-person only vehicle operation is at least a design decision that is unique and will be remembered. How it\u2019s remembered, only time will tell.A major win for Far Cry 6 is the combat and movement. Not long after you're turned loose in the world, you'll receive your first Supremo, a backpack that acts like a mobile skill tree with a special ability and some gadgets. The unique ability charges over time, and features things like a barrage of rockets, cloud of poison, or healing abilities. Supremos can be equipped or modified at any workbench, allowing you to swap them in and out to fit the situation. Instead of always having the skills you selected in a traditional skill tree active, you are focusing your build around the gear you're wearing and carrying. This\u00a0is a step away from other Ubisoft offerings and a decision that I applaud.Before heading out on a mission or engaging in combat, you'll normally start at a base, camp, HQ, or any of the other places Libertad calls home. I mean, you don\u2019t have to start there, but friendly camps allow players to improve their gear, buy new gear, call for vehicles, get quests, and even take part in some of the many activities in Yara. Camps can be upgraded via a construction desk that allows you to build specific additions for activities like hunting and fishing, as well as other endeavors.After leaving camp and setting out to cause trouble, the gear and combat came together for me. I used a Supremo backpack that fired a barrage of rockets. I added perception grenades to mark enemies, EMP grenades to disable alarms, regular grenades for blowing stuff up, and baseballs to lure and distract foes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47165936-2867-44bc-befa-3c3b88cd70bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "47165936-2867-44bc-befa-3c3b88cd70bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "f593a823-dca4-4f83-a49d-3a6e8b09e05e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0fb193d726e3a2fa63537b0b1d180eb3caeb51f0b37c558cc46b1fb6a475d3b"}, "3": {"node_id": "d905d4bf-1c99-4df1-bcf2-8289a8e7d822", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "744676e03911573161f22b65606676eff4dd1cb8dff06ba7272e4aeb72315c05"}}, "hash": "217d37ddd63e73103f5abb7655b8cfae65c12a8572caae53fa6663b4731abc1c", "text": "Combine this with my suppressed lever-action rifle with a 4x scope, an SMG, and an RPG, and I was living the guerrilla fantasy my way and having a blast. Stealth was no longer the slow play it used to be. I was clearing bases in a few minutes, going full parkour by scaling walls and zooming down zip lines, ending with satisfying headshots that I\u2019m utterly addicted to. When injured in the fight, I loved seeing Dani heal by bending a broken finger to point the right way, snapping a dislocated wrist into place, or wrapping duct tape around a wound.When a location is cleared and your fingers are pointing in the right direction, it\u2019s time to collect the loot. Far Cry 6 does a better job of not making you spend 15 minutes picking up weapons and armor after every fight, which was an issue in Ghost Recon Breakpoint. There might be one gun, which could be a standard or a unique weapon. These drop at different levels, and overcoming the enemy is about not only leveling up your character, but also choosing the right gear for the job.Combat efficiency is tied into the gear you wear or the perks and mods equipped on weapons. Clothing can offer bonuses, but the transmog system means you can look the way you want and not give up any of the functionality. While the bulk of Far Cry 6 is first person, Dani will appear in cutscenes wearing whatever you equipped. The result is unique builds designed to to be powerful no matter the individual styles of play, while not giving up anything in terms of visual expression.What misses for me in Far Cry 6 are companions. Some of the quests to get these companions are fun, but most of the time these helpers are more of a nuisance than anything. The number of times Chorizo (the little dog with wheels for back legs) would get stuck trying to follow me, or get downed in combat, far outweighed any benefit. That\u2019s not to say companions aren\u2019t adorable (Chorizo) or hilarious (Chicharron) but, unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t translate into useful. Frankly, I miss Nick Rye from Far Cry 5.Far Cry 6 is stuffed with so many things going on that it\u2019s impossible to discuss each system or feature in detail without turning this into a novel. While there\u2019s the perception that more content is better, and that can be true, too much content means that not all of it ends up being high quality. With Far Cry 6, it feels like Ubisoft knew that to fill this vast map, it had to stick everything possible into Yara, and some of it misses the mark.On the other hand, some things do stick. The Treasure Hunts in Far Cry 6 are both fun and rewarding, offering simple puzzles to solve or tricky terrain to navigate. At the end you'll normally find a useful piece of gear as your reward. Yaran Stories can be hit or miss. These side missions can lead to recruiting a new companion or NPC, or just uncovering more about Yara in general. Racing is a cool way to pass time and collect items for your ride, and I was oddly addicted to Los Bandidos Operations, a cool mini game that can be played at camps where players must deploy leaders and guerrillas to complete an objective. It\u2019s something that plays out in menus, but it\u2019s well done and an unexpected highlight for me.The activities I\u2019m not a fan of are hunting, fishing, mythical creatures, and cockfighting. These generally tie into other parts of gameplay, like trading fish and animal meat for materials. The problem with fishing and hunting specifically, is that other games do it better than Far Cry 6, and the motivation to to hunt or fish in Yara misses badly. I have no desire to go fishing to get meat I can trade for a material needed to upgrade a weapon, and since these activities don't really offer any captivating gameplay on their own, I generally couldn't be bothered. The lone exception to this was killing mythical creatures without ever having to leave my helicopter. It felt very Far Cry, but even that didn't compel me to look for more of them.Far Cry 6 also features a Special Operations mode that can be played solo or in co-op. These can reward gear items and a special currency that can be used to buy things from a specific vendor. Once you complete a Special Operation on the lowest difficulty, you can head back in and try it on a harder one. My time in Special Operations was as a solo player and, while fun, it's clearly designed with co-op in mind.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d905d4bf-1c99-4df1-bcf2-8289a8e7d822": {"__data__": {"id_": "d905d4bf-1c99-4df1-bcf2-8289a8e7d822", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "47165936-2867-44bc-befa-3c3b88cd70bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "217d37ddd63e73103f5abb7655b8cfae65c12a8572caae53fa6663b4731abc1c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e1e9ac9-a6e9-4704-89b8-dc363d23c751", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5be992450efa460a89072d016dd4214ff2a08af79fd96f3677b7a51629d0c232"}}, "hash": "744676e03911573161f22b65606676eff4dd1cb8dff06ba7272e4aeb72315c05", "text": "When it comes to the characters and story of Far Cry 6, I loved the performances and thought most of the actors did a fantastic job, especially Nisa Gunduz (female Dani) and Giancarlo Esposito (Anton Castillo). My issue is that most of the NPCs that you meet along the way are written in a way that makes them so over the top that they are each forgettable. If everyone at the party is the center of attention, nobody is, and Far Cry 6 falls into this trap. Juan Cortez, a Libertad member, might be the exception.Giancarlo Esposito suffers the same fate as Jon Bernthal in Ghost Recon Breakpoint. I think Esposito got about five minutes of screen time in the first 10 hours. That obviously picks up in the back half of the experience as the narrative progresses, but there are long gaps between appearances that can lead to the story losing its steam. Some of this could have been the order I chose to play through missions, or how much exploring I did outside of the main story, but a bit more of Esposito early on wouldn\u2019t have been a bad thing. The scenes where Castillo is grooming his son Diego to be the future leader of Yara are fantastic.When the dust finally settles in Yara, Far Cry 6 is both a fantastic game with some unique design choices and one that tries too hard to please everyone. The scope of activities and the gaps between meaningful screen time for Anton Castillo early on can lead to an experience that lacks direction.Even with a few missteps, Far Cry 6 is a triumph in a few ways that should be celebrated. The graphics are spectacular, and I imagine they will be spoken about by everyone who visits Yara. The choice to leave the skill tree behind has resulted in engaging combat that makes the gameplay feel tighter. Mix in a few fun activities while ignoring some that fail to resonate, and the good far outweighs the bad. Far Cry 6 is an immensely fun game that series fans and open-world aficionados won\u2019t want to miss.This review is based on a PC download key provided by the publisher for review considerations.

It gives me an excuse to play Fenix Rising and get a bit further in Asshala as well. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOh yeah, Fenix Rising had a bunch of DLC too.  I should go back to that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFar Cry 6 at 76 on Metacritic. Lowest rated Far Cry ever. Oh well.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA lot of the \u201creviews\u201d aren\u2019t even about the game.

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s invalid. It just seems to be the extremely dominant thing - with very little references to the actual game.

Constructing these buildings would unlock new systems including a cantina where I could trade in fish and animal meat to gain temporary buffs. If I wanted to make the most of the fish meat, I would first need to use more gasoline and metal to construct the fishing hut to find the best spots. I closed the game. \n\t\t\t\t\tFirst sentence of article.\r \"I made it five hours into Far Cry 6 before I hit Alt+F4 and walked away. \"  Welp, I made it 5 seconds into his opinion before closing it.\t\t\t\t\nIt was fun when I did the first time in Far Cry 3, which came out in 2012. It was a little better but the same when I did it in Far Cry Primal. It was entirely boring and unnecessary when I did it in Far Cry 5. The fact that Far Cry 6 thinks it can essentially deliver the exact same game a decade later is just depressing.\r...\rOpen world games are supposed to invite the possibility of exploration and discovery. In Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, the game\u2019s various systems collide in fun and surprising ways. In Ubisoft\u2019s open world sandboxes, and Far Cry 6 is no exception, the fun feels prescribed. If you\u2019ve played an Assassin\u2019s Creed, Ghost Recon, or Far Cry in the last ten years you know how Far Cry 6 will play out. You\u2019ll climb a tower near an outpost, mark various targets within, then kill them.\r...\rIt\u2019s a small change on the surface that has titanic consequences for the flow of the gameplay. In Far Cry 5, perk points unlocked as the player completed challenges. Kill enemies with melee weapons or get a certain amount of headshots, say, and you unlock points you spend to upgrade your character. In Far Cry 6 all those upgrades are tied to gear. There\u2019s no challenges to complete, just boxes to find scattered across the island. Unless, of course, you want to buy some of the best possible gear from Ubisoft\u2019s in-game store.  All the things you'd expect from another iteration of an Ubi franchise\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI never played it, but I was under the impression that Primal was pretty substandard?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNever played it either but I give it credit for being different at least. Legit being set in the stone age, kinda ballsy and unique\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo but it got a lot of flack because the world map was the same as Far Cry 4. Which makes sense once you know that Primal started out as dlc for Far Cry 4.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt actually tried to do something different than the other Far Crys and whoops got shit on by all of us for it. I personally loved that game, it put survival elements and melee into open world Far Cry and I loved it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImagine expecting more from far cry SIX in two thousand twenty one and then still writing all this\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tit's true, most people seemed to expect Far Cry 6 to be more of the same, and they're rating it appropriately given that. You can't sell people the same product for 10 years and expect them to be equally excited each time.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn established series don\u2019t always have to be stagnant, Resident Evil reinvented itself in 7 \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's weird how Far Cry of all things went from a Crytek sandbox showcase to this Ubisoft franchise monster.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUbisoft grinds every franchise into paste and then puts it into one of two molds.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIs crytek doing anything at the moment?

That's how you know it's thesaurus day. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is absolutely no surprise based on how much they are leaning in to this model, in guessing limited edition weapons, resources every grindy or you can buy them, etc. Probably a big push to show off in coop, etc. To get your friends to pony up.But this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone whose played the previous games and see how they are leaning into microtransactionsThen you wash up on a bright beach and recruit a futbol jersey-wearing crocodile named Guapo to your revolutionary cause. For 500 Far Cry Points, roughly $4.99, you can buy a cool outfit for Guapo in the in-game store.     \n\t\t\t\t\tThe microtransaction store has been a thing in Ubisoft games for a while now, but it's never felt egregious or forced on you to progress.  At least for me.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI think one of the Assassin's Creed games went overboard and they have since dialed it back but I don't remember which one. Maybe it was Unity?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaybe?  That's the one that I never got very far in.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIs it as depressingly nihilistic as 5? The gunplay in 5 was a lot of fun, but the whole thing felt so negative I put it down pretty quick. Also, I didn't like getting attacked every 8 seconds in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes I just want to wander in relative peace, y'know?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat's why in 6 they let you holster your weapon and walk around.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe review also mentions backwoods paths traveled by the rebels.  Presumably they're safe, or at least safer, than the roads?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGuerrilla Paths. These wind through the forests and mountains and you can drive small vehicles (smaller than cars) on them or walk. They are generally safe, except where they may intersect a road traveled by the military. They are great early on as I had to do a bit of walking. Later on, they are less important because I fly everywhere. But, overall there is much less confrontation when you are driving on a road, and these paths help.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI never want to wander in relative peace. Wandering is boring because it's the time I'm not shooting anything. It's tough for them to cater to everyone.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSneakyalmond says he doesn't want to sneak around, but wage war\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat's what he wants to believe. It's all part of the nut agenda\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI get your point, but at the same time, the constant need to fight everything got a bit much in some of the previous games, especially when you're just trying to drive from point A to point B.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can holster your weapon and \"blend in\" in 6, plus many of the enemies aren't outright hostile.  There's going to be a lot more general exploration and wandering I think.  Which is good because the graphics sound incredible.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYes but they didn't include a reasonable explanation why you should even need to holster your weapon along with an entire subplot describing arm sales and the 2nd amendment and how the gun lobby works so hard pass\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can drive by almost any enemy and they won't attack you. If you take your gun out in some places, they will warn you to put it away. You can walk within feet of soldiers and not be attacked. I wouldn't call it peaceful by any stretch, and it doesn't promote exploring, but it's nice not to have every soldier on earth shoot at you as you're driving down the road or walking through the forest.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat was my biggest complaint with 5, felt like I had 3 stars wanted level at all times - annoying.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll these Far Cry games and they never thought to set them sometime in the past. 60's Far Cry would at least have a unique flair.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere was primal but that's quite a bit farther in the past.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40569928-1d43-4750-b822-16a9848cbdae": {"__data__": {"id_": "40569928-1d43-4750-b822-16a9848cbdae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f97023b-70d8-492b-8a79-5248a9a688e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "36fa46c99d564f32deb69570272a250273a1dd0cd91658b41f54b189c4b16599"}, "3": {"node_id": "6af02a68-4fd7-40a8-ad94-3d12757c79b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "56e607a5de054b4d5af872366e4b85936a945f41819e7a2fe09f15bd2e1be28e"}}, "hash": "27dc4f47057e37b43101515245bd4976c6a4d65f0d46cbdb9e0b3524b98be732", "text": "There was primal but that's quite a bit farther in the past.

Castillo has reinstated a citizen draft for the ongoing cultivation of Viviro, a homegrown wonder drug that cures cancer. Made by fertilizing Yara's tobacco crops with a chemical gas, this magic medicine is the key, the president declares, to lifting his broken-down island into the upper echelons of the world economic stage.But this is Far Cry, well-known for its love of open-world war games, destabilized nation-states, and crackpot despots. And Castillo, played with gusto by Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad), is certainly a tyrant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6af02a68-4fd7-40a8-ad94-3d12757c79b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6af02a68-4fd7-40a8-ad94-3d12757c79b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "40569928-1d43-4750-b822-16a9848cbdae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "27dc4f47057e37b43101515245bd4976c6a4d65f0d46cbdb9e0b3524b98be732"}, "3": {"node_id": "a500df68-c888-4927-95b3-e6e318a0b515", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2713abf1bf4e9c9273a1310e37e559ce18ae28d4191150fdc9b7611a13eb6c31"}}, "hash": "56e607a5de054b4d5af872366e4b85936a945f41819e7a2fe09f15bd2e1be28e", "text": "The truth we're shown during his address\u2014of citizens being shipped off to the fields as forced slave labor or gunned down for resisting\u2014is a non-revelation given the series' touchstones.It's when the president's forces then march into Yara's capital of Esperanza and begin indiscriminately slaughtering everyone on the \"draft\" list that I first raised an eyebrow. Though this series has made its cartoonishly warped sociopaths the stars of their respective games for some time, the game-y nonsense of making your fascist regime an inhuman death squad before it's had time to carry out the vile plan your antagonist\u00a0just finished explaining is beyond ridiculous. It also feels like peak Far Cry\u2014and maybe says a lot about where these games are today.You can't say Far Cry isn't aware of its own ridiculousness; starting with 2012's Far Cry 3, the order of the day has been breezy, stupid, free-form fun. The franchise has incentivized running riot through typically exoticized locales by enticing you with truckloads of guns and gimmicky death toys to inflict maximum mayhem. That is, if you're not already distracted by setting things on fire; hunting wildlife (or otherwise unleashing it on hapless goons); capturing occupied strongholds and points of interest; tearing around air, sea, and sky in all kinds of vehicles with and without mounted weaponry; or engaging in any of the other myriad activities that have become staples of the series.And so it goes with Far Cry 6. You play as Yaran ex-soldier Dani Rojas, who has just escaped Castillo's draft in Esperanza and has become a member of Libertad, a revolutionary group with plans to overthrow Castillo's rule and free Yara. To do that, the band of guerrilla fighters needs the support of a number of allies spread across the western, central, and eastern parts of the massive country.In practice, earning their pledges boils down to familiar territory for longtime players. You're given the option to take on bigger, set piece-type missions at your leisure or just screw around with side distractions like pursuing a homing-beacon pelican across the sky to hidden caches of \"treasure\" (loot and gear) and chasing a geriatric guerrilla through a carnival of explosive traps to deliver a love letter.To its credit, developer Ubisoft has gradually made each passing entry in this series increasingly frictionless. Getting around and terrorizing Castillo's troops in whatever ways you feel like is straightforward from the get-go\u2014even momentum-destroying enemy checkpoints, a sticking point to greater or lesser degrees in earlier entries\u2014don't pose much of an impediment this time around.Early on, I was easily able to gain access to an enemy base with some parked tanks and only a handful of guards on duty. A few messy machete stealth kills later, I stole a tank and wreaked explosive havoc for almost an hour, turning hostile jeeps into hunks of twisted metal, sending soldiers ragdolling comically, and otherwise bulldozing through everything destructible that got in my way.I have to admit, there's some brainless fun to be had here.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

It\u2019s just another day in paradise.\r\n\r\nFar Cry 6\u2019s paradise hinges on fantasies \u2014 the fantasy that one man can shape fate, that corruption can be overturned, and that you\u2019ll believe the situation on Yara is deeper and more complex than it really is.. The latest in Ubisoft\u2019s long-running franchise refines the series\u2019 penchant for chaos, but the fight against Castillo is far from the only civil war taking place here. Far Cry 6 is at odds with itself as well.\r\n\r\nFar Cry 6 begins with a bang, or, more accurately, hundreds of them. Government soldiers raid a mid-sized city on Yara\u2019s main island, ostensibly hunting rebels, but actually capturing dissidents and outcasts as labor supplies for Ant\u00f3n Castillo\u2019s work camps.\r\n\r\nDani escapes with her friends and fellow orphans, before ending up alone on Isla Santuario, a government outpost off the Yaran coast. Her sole mission is making it as far away from Yara as possible, but she can only do that with help from Libertad, the guerrilla revolutionary group bent on destroying Castillo and everything he stands for.\r\n\r\nDani is a first for Far Cry in many ways. She\u2019s a vulnerable and reluctant participant, rather than an overpowered \u201cchosen one\u201d hero, and watching her ease into the role of liberator throughout the game makes for a satisfying narrative arc, even though her character growth is limited and predictable.\r\n\r\nDespite his central role (and Hollywood casting), Castillo doesn\u2019t steal the show, at least not all the time. Giancarlo Esposito\u2019s performance as the unpredictable and brutal dictator is captivating, but Castillo is a villain we\u2019ve seen before. What\u2019s of more interest is the themes Far Cry 6 tries addressing and the people it uses in the process.\r\n\r\nFar Cry 6 touches on a surprising range of topics in weaving its tale of revolution, from the middle class\u2019 role in fueling rebellion to the process of institutionalizing division and notions of the \u201cother.\u201d Yara\u2019s Libertad are idealists, but grounded ones who recognize removing a corrupt regime is far from the last act of a successful rebellion. They\u2019re also progressive, providing homes and a purpose for Castillo\u2019s so-called undesirables, including LGBTQ+ Yarans disowned by their families.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame, then, that Ubisoft doesn\u2019t carry this narrative further. There\u2019s potential for a unique perspective on war, politics, and society buried in Far Cry 6 that most video games and media in general tend to avoid. \r\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s still a Far Cry game before it\u2019s anything else. Recognizing these factors exist is as deep as Far Cry 6 goes, and this is where it relies on the idea of guerrilla fantasy to hold itself together. There\u2019s just enough suggestion of depth in the characters and their struggles, but anything beyond what you briefly see and hear is your responsibility to provide. \r\n\r\nYou see this the most with optional guerrilla objectives, Dani\u2019s opportunities to dismantle Castillo\u2019s regime at its foundation. One set of tasks in Valle de Oro targets Maria Marquessa\u2019s propaganda machines, including a film studio and broadcast station. Clara urges you to do as much damage as possible, both to show Castillo you mean business and to hamper his propaganda efforts in the region, but you\u2019re left imagining the effects. \r\n\r\nDani\u2019s actions earn Libertad a new base, some fresh intel on hidden caches \u2014 and nothing more. There\u2019s no change in Castillo\u2019s broadcast abilities, no influence over guerrilla efforts, and not even the Matanzas, the group you\u2019re aiding, recognize what you\u2019ve accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the same across Yara\u2019s other regions. There\u2019s a sense of disconnect between your guerrilla work and the sub-stories about Yara\u2019s culture and people Ubisoft tries telling, and it highlights the limits of adhering to the series\u2019 familiar structure. \r\n\r\nDespite its shortcomings, Far Cry 6\u2019s guerrilla fantasy is still hypnotic, with some outstanding moments as well. The set-piece that ends the tutorial genuinely had me on the edge of my chair, and arriving in Esperanza the first time inspired a sense of awe, dread, and anticipation as the magnitude of the task in front of you slowly becomes apparent.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d8f59b6-c619-4fb4-a951-d2b820191e3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d8f59b6-c619-4fb4-a951-d2b820191e3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9e685d1-2dcb-440d-9432-4ad269bd7352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ab1790abfccf39b5b981c10aeb137fd95cdc26df3b70c7c63ac708b8a720e0e"}, "2": {"node_id": "a500df68-c888-4927-95b3-e6e318a0b515", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2713abf1bf4e9c9273a1310e37e559ce18ae28d4191150fdc9b7611a13eb6c31"}, "3": {"node_id": "aebc499c-e656-4b5d-953d-ac5b5d8c66c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0cbd872378285a39ea2d5f6069c34680600f4d209e65e8f06335eb9a1a446c0f"}}, "hash": "7ef652d57e96a3ebe218a56aa8132126b2295a6eecaf2b4072d2e0acb4d28c8e", "text": "Castillo\u2019s regime and the horrors it inflicts are despicable enough where you feel invested in Dani\u2019s fight. Every encounter with Castillo\u2019s soldiers feels like a small victory for the people, even though you know it has no value outside letting you play with big guns.\r\n\r\nGranted, playing with the big guns \u2014 and the small ones, and the gas-powered ones \u2014 is incredibly fun on its own and makes Far Cry 6 the epitome of chaos sandbox. \r\n\r\nDani gets the standard sniper rifles and shotguns over the course of her journey. Mods ranging from poison ammo to high-powered scopes help keep combat interesting by providing endless methods of approaching each task, but it\u2019s the rare, pre-modded Resolver weapons that stand out the most. \r\n\r\nThe motorized crossbow literally blows enemies away, while the nailgun rivals any submachine gun Dani can swipe from Castillo\u2019s army. A personal favorite is the Resolver revolver, a monster of a handgun paired with a metal riot shield that replaces Dani\u2019s machete attack with an overpowered punch. Yara might be vast and beautiful, but these weapons, created with scraps, leftover uranium, and a touch of Juan Cortez\u2019s unstable genius, are what give Far Cry 6 its strongest sense of place and emphasize the struggle\u2019s guerrilla roots more than anything else. Take the Supremo, for example. It\u2019s a kind of ultimate weapon cobbled together from garbage and glue \u2014 finding Supremo Bond adhesive is actually required to upgrade it \u2014 that launches baseballs and dynamite. It also feeds on the blood of your enemies, because of course it does.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t even going into the trained attack companions, wild tank rides across Yara\u2019s countryside, gliding into restricted airspace using a wingsuit, or the dozens of other outrageous things Dani can do in the name of liberation.\r\n\r\nThe problem is where she\u2019s doing them. Ubisoft isn\u2019t trying to hide the similarities between Yara and Cuba: the colonized Latin island with a prized agricultural crop, the mid-century revolution that propelled a militaristic tyrant into power, American trade restrictions, Miami as the first stop for refugees, and countless others. Far Cry 6\u2019s themes are universal, arguably even more applicable to contemporary American society than anywhere else. There\u2019s no discernable reason for choosing not-Cuba as the setting. At worst, it subtly reinforces stereotypes framing Latin American nations as war-torn and corrupt without the necessary narrative depth to explore the factors that cause these conflicts to begin with.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s illustrative of the broader conflict Far Cry 6 finds itself facing with, well\u2026 itself. It wants to spin a more involved narrative, but steps back before things get too serious. Yaran Stories hint at deeper worldbuilding, though adhering to the standard Far Cry and open world structure means staleness creeps into exploration and guerrilla activities. Juan Cortez was more accurate than he realized when he recruited Dani to Libertad. Far Cry 6 prefers playing guerrilla over more serious reflection because \u201cblowing up shit is fun,\u201d and Ubisoft just isn\u2019t quite ready to give that up yet.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Tested on Xbox Series S, with a copy of the game provided by the publisher.
