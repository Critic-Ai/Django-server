That's perhaps over-simplifying the arc for Capcom's beast-bashing grindathon par excellence, but the series now has a huge fanbase and the kind of resource behind it that has resulted in years of better and better games, as well as a distinct split.There's the Monster Hunter: World take on the series, which has the fundamentals but is a seriously big-budget endeavour\u2014a visual and aural spectacle with gorgeous, flowing animations and jaw-dropping monsters. Monster Hunter: Rise is the other branch, following in the footsteps of games like Generations and hewing closer to the series' portable heritage: Smaller, more contained maps rather than larger more open-world style exploration.Rise was, of course, originally designed as a Nintendo Switch exclusive and, though this PC release is a good port with everything you'd expect, it has nowhere near that immediate visual 'wow' factor that World did. Nor can it compete on things like textures or the stunning bespoke animations for monsters fighting each other.Thing is, though, Rise is the better game.Monster Hunter's problem for new players is also the game's main strength: This is a combat system of almost unparalleled depth and precision, with literally dozens of fundamentally different playstyles. It's overwhelming at first. Rise has easily the best onboarding experience in the series, and in the process introduces several new mechanics that enhance the hunting experience even beyond Generations.One of the most fun additions is your Palamute, a rideable dog. You've still got your Palico, of course, but the dog transforms the game's traversal which, arguably, was always a weak\u2014or at least not standout\u2014element. Series veterans will recall many a long slog across maps you know like the back of your hand, simply because that's the way things were, but in Rise your options with and without the dog now include wall running and a Spider-Man-style grapple that doubles up as an essential battle tool. You can not only get around faster than ever, but it feels amazing to do so.This in turn changes up the rhythm of fights but in an awesome way. In older Monster Hunters, there always comes the point in a fight where your quarry realises they're in a spot of bother and takes off. You could very rarely stop them escaping or interrupt these movement sequences, but now, you just instantly hop on the dog and give chase. This may make me sound slightly psychopathic but it is enormously satisfying to chase down a wounded creature trying to escape, and set about it with your mates.\u00a0Performance was smooth on a GTX 1070\u2014not that you'd expect any different. Rise does suffer from screen tearing on occasion, though I didn't notice any frame drops or other performance issues. There are some basic presets before the graphics settings allow you to turn a wide range of options on or off, as per your preference, as well as support for ultrawide monitors and an uncapped framerate.\n\nThe obvious caveat here is that, if you're playing this in 4K on max settings with a mega rig\u2026 it's never going to compete at that level. If you can stomach a few jagged edges and fuzzy textures, however, the art style more than makes up for the lack of grunt.There's a quality to Rise that maybe isn't obvious, which is that it has stripped away an enormous amount of the busywork the games used to come with. You used to have to look up what the 'key quests' for each hunter rank were online, for example, whereas now the game just tells you. The upgrade trees for weapons have been made clearer.

It punts all the stuff that was a bit annoying.In turn this means you spend most of your time playing Monster Hunter: Rise actually hunting monsters rather than fiddling around in menus or trying to work out what to do next, and hunting is absolutely why I play these games. You can zoom through hunts with almost zero downtime, and combined with the generally faster pace of the game it makes Rise feel so much more pacey and vibrant than the older titles. The sense of verticality it has in the locations and the way you zip around them soon becomes second nature, and it really feels like from the opening seconds the chase is on.\u00a0Monster Hunter has always been unforgiving: if you take its monsters lightly, even the weediest will quickly dispatch you. Rise follows the usual pattern of setting you off against small dinosaur-like creatures like the Great Baggi or Great Wroggi before introducing the wilder, weirder stuff like Tigrex, the stone-cold classics like Rathalos, and the (mostly) awe-inspiring fights against the Elder Dragons.\u00a0It's actually difficult to describe a 'typical' hunt in Monster Hunter: Rise because part of the game's inexhaustible quality is that there are so many dozens of large monsters by now it can mix-and-match them in endless new combinations. It's also less shy than ever before about having monsters fight one another, which used to happen rarely in the older games but is now very frequent (you can also temporarily 'ride' the monsters during these and enjoy a Godzilla moment).This may make me sound slightly psychopathic but it is enormously satisfying to chase down a wounded creature trying to escape. The monsters look absolutely amazing, and the older ones have more aggressive and surprising behaviours than ever. This game is a riot: I went with gunlance (again) because I love it, and the weapon has certain familiar moves but also a whole bevvy of new ones that make it feel completely new. The more Rise you play, the more it has to give. You begin unlocking special moves that give each weapon's moveset a new angle of approach, or a ten-tonne slam for when it's needed (Gunlance's big downside was always low mobility, but in Rise this feels irrelevant when you're doggo-sprinting, grappling, and force-blasting across the landscape). Sometimes you try out a new ability, process what has just happened, then mime a chef kiss and give silent thanks to the Capcom brain that thought it up.\u00a0The sheer variety of Rise's bestiary and weapons means that, even as the game cracks on at enormous pace, it doesn't stop serving up new stuff for a very long time. There's so much to do here, and it's all laid-out and explained better than ever, with all of the little fiddly bits that used to annoy players just gone. Sure, this might be a Nintendo Switch game in origin, and visually it shows. But who cares, because it's hard to shake the feeling that Monster Hunter Rise is as good as this series has ever been. Which is to say: As good as it gets.Monster Hunter: Rise is arguably the greatest entry in Capcom's flagship series, and a game that simply never stops giving.Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nEurogamer, Magnanimalos.I've just drifted my dog into battle, his hindlegs tilting out in a glorious arc at the press of a button for that precious extra boost of speed, before dismounting with the flick of a wirebug that sends a silken line up into the sky, allowing me to grapple onto it and swing towards my prey. In mid-air I pull out a sword fashioned from the remains of a bony Besarios and drive it straight down into the skull of another. Bring this big bastard down and I can fashion a hat out of his hide to complete my Besarios outfit and grant myself an attack boost, so that I might be able to go out and do it again only with more flair, and more efficiency. \r\n Good gosh do I love Monster Hunter.\r\n The core loop remains unchanged but Capcom's series has evolved an awful lot since its inception way back in 2004, and after a long run on Nintendo's console that peaked with the exceptional Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate it was only after 2018's multi-platform Monster Hunter World that the series found a proper foothold in the west. Here was Monster Hunter at its most accessible - and, with expansion Iceborne, at its most brutal - and for the first time it no longer felt like a niche pursuit. Monster Hunter had finally gone mainstream.\r\n Forgive me for making crass assumptions, but I'd presumed the series' return to Nintendo, and to more modest hardware - Monster Hunter Rise is a Switch timed exclusive, with the PC version not arriving until early 2022 - might mean a more modest outing for the series. I could not have been more wrong. This is as lavish and opulent a thing as Monster Hunter's ever seen, Capcom's inhouse RE Engine excelling in its debut for the series while its soundtrack is fully orchestrated and accompanied by full vocals (every single monster gets its own unique introductory song complete with shamisen and hyoshigi in keeping with Rise's traditional Japanese theming). It's as if all that money made through Monster Hunter World's success somehow made it into Rise' production. \r\n This is as significant a step forward for Monster Hunter as World was before it, with a generous suite of new features making hunting more palatable, more action packed and much, much more pleasurable. Before running through them all, though, there's one underlying change worth noting that's seismic in nature, and that informs everything that's new this time out. Traditionally in this series, you're the whipping boy - for the first few dozen hours at least - as you get knocked this way and that by all number of beautiful beasts. In Monster Hunter Rise, however, you are OP AF, and I am 100 per cent for it. \r\n It's not so much that the monsters here are a pushover, and more that Rise is willing to push you through it all with a bit more pep and pace than seen in previous games - here you'll be going head to head with new signature beast Magnamalo when an earlier entry would still have you ferrying eggs from one end of the map to another. Hunts are quicker, too - even the later enemies unlocked after the credits roll, itself done after some 20 hours, can be felled in just over 10 minutes if you've half an idea what you're doing. Is that a problem for a series where endurance and hard-edged challenge has often been part of the make-up? Maybe for some but most certainly not for me - and anyway, the reason these things go down so much quicker is because you the player are so much more dynamic than ever before, with so much more in your arsenal.The headline addition might be the wirebugs that let you fling from point to point, though they're just one part of a whole cohort of new colleagues that open Monster Hunter's maps like never before. As in Monster Hunter World, maps are now one continuous area rather than the partitioned zones of old, though they're freer and less claustrophobic than the dense biomes found last time out, partly to make room for the all-new Palamutes. These are canine mounts, on hand to hop onto at the press of a button and taking so much of the misery out of tracking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfe5570a-e22a-431c-b95d-70c0c671d16b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfe5570a-e22a-431c-b95d-70c0c671d16b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "03b441c4-623f-4c30-b528-a1722a273c02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0df840a33eb60093700382f3c0886badb791929beb4a6cdb2e3f299793013e06"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f0d5cdd-9115-4c20-a51b-71270e26a91c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ea045dbcb30979d0b4c234f5edfdb9a2a1cde179e371d72315daeaf7c037e39"}}, "hash": "04f30f0373ae1aaa8297fb8cf24ad558f0fcf30ee5d87ad447bca1e9e6df5780", "text": "It helps that these things are absolute delights, customisable to an outrageous degree whether that's through you outfitting them with spoils picked up through your adventure or even in the character creator itself (a tool that's as powerful as any I've seen in a game like this, and something that could quite easily consume the first half dozen hours of your time with Monster Hunter Rise should you be that way inclined).Another new feature to be found in Monster Hunter Rise are the Rampage events - though their impact and indeed even their frequency is limited in the extreme in the base game. Essentially it's an evolution of some of the more staged encounters we've seen in previous games, only this time out you're building defences and mounting guns as you face down hordes of enemies that precede one final big bad. It's a neat wrinkle and enjoyable enough the few times they crop up though that scarcity suggests they're not too important a part of Monster Hunter Rise's make-up. Whether that changes in the future as Rise is updated remains to be seen. While riding your Palamute you can consume items or resharpen your weapon, and the act of tracking itself has been greatly streamlined: thanks to your new Cohoot buddy, it's now simply possible to see each monster on the map, a blunt solution that's still more elegant than Monster Hunter World's scoutflies that have now been completely excised. The actual involvement of your Cohoot is limited, admittedly, though it's hard to complain too much: Monster Hunter Rise gives you an owl companion you can dress as you please, and that's plenty good enough for me.For all that, and the returning Palicoes that aid you in battle, it is those wirebugs that really do make all the difference. How profound that will ultimately prove to be it's hard to say- after 50 hours with Rise, I'm only really just beginning to prod at the possibilities - though I will say they're responsible for one of the most engaging, open and elastic traversal systems I've seen in a game outside of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wilds. Seemingly nowhere is out of bounds now, and while they're limited as a resource - you typically have two flings available on a cooldown timer - a short combination of well-timed leaps can have you scaling even Rise's greatest heights. Combine that with Rise's impeccable gyro aiming and you've got a movement system that's simply delicious.It's tempting to dwell on a comparison with Breath of the Wild, but truthfully it's an extension of a path the series first set upon with Monster Hunter 4's emphasis on verticality and mounting. Mounting is something that returns here in Rise, though in keeping with the mentality found elsewhere it's now been supercharged. That same silk wire that can propel you around the map can also entrap prey and allow you to control them, puppet style, to unleash even more damage, giving turf wars an extra edge as you smash two monsters together. It is as gloriously overstated and over-the-top as everything else you'll find in Monster Hunter Rise.That wire silk also lends each of Monster Hunter's staple 14 weapon types a new edge, granting them new moves that eat away at your wirebug resource in exchange for a dazzling volley. Then, of course, there's simply the ability to launch into combos while airborne with that bit more ease, or how the added movement impacts positioning in a scrap. Factor in the aforementioned gyro controls that make ranged weapons more viable for players like myself who've previously been reluctant to experiment and you've got a Monster Hunter that can feel profoundly different to what's gone before. Indeed if there's another offshoot to Monster Hunter Rise's empowering of the player it's how it encourages experimentation, encouraging you to pick up a weapon type you might previously have neglected, or poke around in the depths to be found elsewhere. And those depths are still there to be explored - with all that the additions bring, I'd argue that Rise is as deep as Monster Hunter has ever been. It's just that those depths have been made a little easier to get to, which is surely no bad thing.  It's all enough to make me believe that this really might be the Monster Hunter for all, and as much as World pushed the series into the mainstream it's Rise that could yet propel it to be a phenomenon - and at the very least it'll earn the series some new fans along the way. If you've been put off by the challenge, the investment or even the action, Rise does its very best to smooth the path and open up Monster Hunter's charms to all. If you're already smitten with the series like I am? Well, Monster Hunter Rise might well be as good as video games can get.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f0d5cdd-9115-4c20-a51b-71270e26a91c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f0d5cdd-9115-4c20-a51b-71270e26a91c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "dfe5570a-e22a-431c-b95d-70c0c671d16b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "04f30f0373ae1aaa8297fb8cf24ad558f0fcf30ee5d87ad447bca1e9e6df5780"}, "3": {"node_id": "b32f95fa-0133-4149-8aeb-cc653e34f97e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "73e8a04a7b5443c7e50c3589a0144ddb1a8c0948247bdd72585971052eb12b9b"}}, "hash": "6ea045dbcb30979d0b4c234f5edfdb9a2a1cde179e371d72315daeaf7c037e39", "text": "From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nMartin Robinson\n\n          Contributor\n        Martin worked at Eurogamer from 2011 to 2023.

In the meantime though their release schedules are bare, with only more minor releases and remasters to keep things ticking over. Ordinarily, you wouldn\u2019t expect Nintendo to be able to rely on third parties to pick up the slack but then Monster Hunter is not an ordinary game.Although it only gained mainstream success in the West with 2018\u2019s Monster Hunter: World, the franchise has been around since the PlayStation 2 era and is a full-blown cultural phenomenon in Japan. It almost single-handedly made the PSP a success in its home territory and its absence on the PS Vita is a major reason why Sony\u2019s second portable console failed.It wasn\u2019t available on the PS Vita because Nintendo signed it up as a portable exclusive on 3DS, something they never usually do and another sign of how important the franchise is considered to be. What deals they\u2019ve made to ensure Rise is a Switch exclusive (on consoles, there is a PC version due next year) they\u2019ll probably never reveal but this is not only a full-bodied entry in the franchise it\u2019s arguably the best it\u2019s ever been.The secret to Monster Hunter: World\u2019s success in the West wasn\u2019t really much of a secret. Much of the franchise\u2019s appeal in Japan was due to the social element involved in meeting up physically to play on PSP. That didn\u2019t translate to the West but having robust online options did and so Monster Hunter finally became a worldwide hit.The obvious reason for making Rise a Switch exclusive is that World wouldn\u2019t run properly on Nintendo\u2019s less powerful console, but as anyone who\u2019s played the demo will already know Rise is one of the best-looking games on the Switch. Certainly, there are compromises in getting it to running at a consistent pace with four people online, but the monsters and human characters look fantastic and the landscapes, while lacking detail close up, are impressively varied and highly interactive.Although Monster Hunter has a long learning curve the basics are very simple. Although there is always some underlying storyline, it\u2019s really just a means to build up the tension around the larger boss-like monsters at the end of game. Generally speaking though Monster Hunter is a game of side quests, where you play as a simple hunter in a medieval village (in this case one that is more obviously Japanese than usual \u2013 although thankfully the Californian dudebro dialogue from the demo has been curtailed in the full game).It\u2019s your job to go out hunting monsters, presumably for their meat but in terms of game rewards you\u2019re after resources such as skin and bones that can be used to craft ever more powerful weapons and armour. It\u2019s a simple loop \u2013 fight monsters to get the equipment needed to fight even bigger monsters \u2013 but it\u2019s one which you have a huge degree of freedom in how you approach.There are 14 different types of weapons (the same 14 from World) that range from a fairly simple sword up to complex ranged devices and Bloodborne style transforming gadgets. New players often find them clumsy to use at first, especially as there\u2019s no lock-on for the camera, but that\u2019s entirely purposeful. Monster Hunter\u2019s combat revolves around learning a monster\u2019s tells and making sure every attack you make is a purposeful one, which it needs to be given the long wind-up for most moves.Although there is an easy-to-use dodge and roll this is miles away from the fast action of Devil May Cry and closer to Dark Souls in terms of relying on careful tactics and planned attacks. Monster Hunter is not nearly as hard as Dark Souls and its ilk though and if anything the main complaint that series regulars will have is that some of the returning monsters require only a more simplified approach to defeat.Compared to previous games in the series Rise has a more arcade style approach, with what amounts to power-ups scattered across each of the maps and some easy to learn combos for each weapon. There\u2019s also the key new feature of wirebugs, which can be used as a grappling hook to get around but also to clamber aboard monsters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "738250e3-6875-4a0a-94a1-e756750f5dd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "738250e3-6875-4a0a-94a1-e756750f5dd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "b32f95fa-0133-4149-8aeb-cc653e34f97e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "73e8a04a7b5443c7e50c3589a0144ddb1a8c0948247bdd72585971052eb12b9b"}, "3": {"node_id": "8dc5c871-105d-4632-9569-fa97a4437631", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e6ba36727b5ef13e620e3a0db11e3c4218fef329ea11e04b799e35774fe04b9"}}, "hash": "c35cd19facb60dd50b246bbcb619f672cc8a74c8425b1b859849f98ad70f8cee", "text": "The idea of mounting creatures is greatly expanded on from World, in that you can ride some of the smaller creatures around for a short time and use their own unique attacks \u2013 or simply get them to slam into a wall and injure themselves.The wirebugs also enable a different set of special moves for each weapon type, that can be used to slow down or ensnare monsters, either for mounting or in conjunction with traps and non-lethal weapons to capture the creature alive (but don\u2019t let that fool you as this is not a game for those squeamish about harming animals, even if there\u2019s never any gore).Even when just sticking to one weapon the variety of options at your disposal are immense, with the game leaving it entirely up to you how you approach a hunt. That includes making use of the canyne hunting partners, which can also be customised with their own weapons and armour.The cat-like palicos are mainstays of the series and particularly useful in helping to cure status aliments and restoring your health. The dog-like palamutes are more suited to combat but can also be rode like a little pony, which is helpful for getting around as you can still collect and use objects as you go.With so many options it\u2019s easy to feel lost at times, even as the game tries its best with detailed pop-up tutorial help on every subject. That\u2019s not nearly as intrusive as it sounds and if anything we would\u2019ve liked to see context-sensitive help keep reappearing, as it\u2019s very easy to forget how whole swathes of the game\u2019s interconnected systems and complex interface work.However, that\u2019s an unavoidable problem with a game this involved and certainly this is more accessible than any of the pre-World games. The best way to learn though is in a team, with the game offering both local and online co-op options. On a technical level the latter seems to work fine pre-launch but the problem comes with the importance of communication. It\u2019s easy to join a hunt in progress with a random player but you could easily play and complete the mission without even seeing them, let along co-operating with them in any meaningful manner.As Switch users have learned to expect by now, if you want to talk while you play you\u2019ll have to use Discord or some other alternative on your own, which is a needless obstacle for what is the best way to play the game.Most people probably expected Rise to be just a slimed down version of World but it\u2019s really not. It takes everything that\u2019s great about that game and mixes it with existing elements from the older titles and an impressive number of new features, which includes the new Rampage quests.These are a key plot element and involve monsters being riled up to attack the village en masse, forcing you to take a defensive stand in what is a mix of survival mode with a Tower Defence style strategy element. Different defences, some automated and some of which you have to control yourself, can be set up before a wave of monsters appear\u2026 at which point your carefully laid plans devolve into frenzied melee action.As an additional style of quest it\u2019s a welcome change of pace and indicative of the fact that this is not just a pared down Monster Hunter: World but a full sequel all of its own, with its own unique features and tempo. Everything about the game feels expansive and carefully detailed, including the excellent level design that hides innumerable secrets in terms of resources, collectables, and unexpected vantage points for a monster ambush. Each is a proper open world too and not split up into separate sections like the older games.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationFrom snowy wastes to a sunken forest, the variety of biomes is highly impressive, with each filled with both new and returning creatures.

Instead, though, the Monster Hunter development team has opted for a smaller, more personal adventure, trading in World\u2019s sprawling plains and snow-capped mountain ranges for a decidedly more low-key tale in Monster Hunter Rise.As the titular monster hunter, the silent protagonist awakens to life in the small village of Kamura on the frontier, embarking on quests for the population to slay tyrannical beasts patrolling the wilderness. Monster Hunter Rise is a hack-and-slash action game at its core, but one with a graceful elegance through its 14 varied weapon types and devastating skill combos.Monster Hunter Rise strikes an impressively delicate balance between gameplay styles. It\u2019s pulling from World\u2019s hefty numbers game and hidden mishmash of systems, and older Monster Hunter games' more arcade-like combat of hammering buttons. The result is something incredible: Rise feels fast and fluid, unshackling itself from many of World\u2019s intricate design systems and feeling more open and inviting for newcomers who just want to slap a monster around.Nowhere is the combat\u2019s fresh pacing better embodied than the Wirebug. A small, unassuming tool, it quickly becomes apparent that the Wirebug has a crucial part to play in every aspect of Monster Hunter Rise\u2019s gameplay. The tool can be used to propel the player into the air, grappling onto ledges to reach higher vantage points, and bringing an excellent sense of verticality to Rise\u2019s biomes. It can even be used to evade a monster\u2019s attacks, pulling the player from the literal jaws of defeat. In combat though, the Wirebug is used to initiate devastating moves, as simply pressing two buttons unleashes a powerful attack for any of the 14 different weapon types.The Wirebug has different actions for every single weapon in Monster Hunter Rise. With the switch axe, for example, it\u2019ll chain together a massive spin attack when used, whereas using it with the long sword propels the hunter up into the air, latching onto a monster and slashing downwards through it. The Wirebug is a brilliant addition to Rise, one that brings a crucial new gameplay element to every weapon, giving series veterans something new to learn and newcomers dependable attacks to learn from. The Wirebug uses are tied to a cooldown timer, so rather than becoming a fundamental of combat, it acts like a crutch to support the player when the going gets tough.All of this is supported by a supple tutorial system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93f9e78f-819a-44f4-ad13-1fc69c39afba": {"__data__": {"id_": "93f9e78f-819a-44f4-ad13-1fc69c39afba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dc5c871-105d-4632-9569-fa97a4437631", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e6ba36727b5ef13e620e3a0db11e3c4218fef329ea11e04b799e35774fe04b9"}, "3": {"node_id": "108ebf88-e41b-435d-9401-64cadcec8766", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f005c59b923726f6ee5364d8c1e69e8ad20140586b39c7b9a8c81c77bbce208d"}}, "hash": "19cd89a29aa76f812556f99839d76719f608915fb22149625d3a1ef7c8404262", "text": "Rise starts out small, making sure the player knows every base combat mechanic and how to use each weapon, before delving into the more complicated territory of the Wirebug, blights, elements, and more. In 2018 it was incredibly easy to get overwhelmed by World\u2019s vast systems and monsters right out of the gate, but Rise does a far better job of making sure rookie hunters and experienced slayers alike are acclimated to the inner workings of the game before turning you loose against deadly beasts.The monsters themselves are an eclectic bunch. Series stalwarts like the fiery Anjanath and the poisonous Rathian return, joined by some utterly nightmare-inducing creatures like the ghastly Khezu. Every monster has something defining that you\u2019ll remember them for: the Khezu can snake its slithery neck around the battlefield like a whip, and the Bishaten uses its claw-like tail to sling poisonous fruits at you. I\u2019ll always have a reaction to seeing any of Rise\u2019s brilliant cast out in the wild: it could be a \u201coh this guy\u201d when a Rathian swoops down on me, or a harrowing scream when the Khezu roams into view. Every single one of Rise\u2019s creatures are memorable in some fashion, no small feat when there\u2019s well over 20 in the base game.There\u2019s not so much of a focus on co-op gameplay in the smaller monster hunts, but that changes the further you progress into Rise\u2019s story. The game\u2019s plot is divided into two paths of progression: village missions, which are designed to be smaller, lower level fights to be overcome by solo players, and bigger hub missions, which require a team of hunters working in close tandem with one another to best. The single-player village missions wrap up decidedly earlier than the co-op hub missions, forcing players down a path of working together with online companions to see the conclusion of Rise\u2019s story. It\u2019s a puzzling design choice - especially for the Nintendo Switch, a console that isn\u2019t exactly known for its robust online infrastructure.Still, Rise\u2019s online features manage to work well within the confines of the Switch\u2019s online capabilities. Approaching the feline mailman in Kamura Village lets the player search for a lobby of four hunters, or set up one of your own, giving you the option to invite friends in or group up with anyone. There\u2019s mercifully very little busywork in getting going with Rise\u2019s online features, and the quick-chat options being a button away and offering a litany of supportive shouts like \u201ccapture the monster\u201d or \u201chold on!\u201d feel catered to strangers working in greater harmony with one another to overcome ferocious hunting quests.Outside of the hunting quests though, Rise introduces a new tower defense-like mode called Rampage. The outset of Rise\u2019s story talks up Rampages as threatening Kamura Village and being the driving point of the story, and that all comes to a head in a fortified arena, where one or several hunters run around installing defenses like ballistas, cannons, and traps to repel the onslaught of monsters before the gates to Kamura Village are breached. The Rampages start off as the focal point of Rise\u2019s story, but quickly find their groove as a way to break up the routine hunting quests.The Rampages are pleasantly enjoyable in the moment but can become increasingly frustrating when you\u2019re faced with monsters that bounce the hunter between them like a volleyball. Rampages further in the game starring elite monsters almost demand to be taken on by a squad of hunters, especially when the AI comrades you can place in ballistas and cannons barely make a dent in the hordes facing Kamura. Despite the frustrations though, Rampages are used sparingly throughout Monster Hunter Rise\u2019s critical story path, offering something new to the standard hunts instead of being a backbone to support the core gameplay loop.Monster Hunter Rise is a great debut for Capcom\u2019s franchise on the Nintendo Switch, smartly providing sublime new tools to the established arsenal like the Wirebug, and acting as a welcoming point of entry for newcomers with overly welcoming tutorial segments. There\u2019s a lot to like about the Rampage missions as a headline addition for the series, however harrowing they might become to face on your own in the latter half of the game. Monster Hunter Rise has the satisfying feeling of a smaller and more compact adventure than 2018\u2019s sprawling World, but tying story progression to the game\u2019s online co-op mode is a little disappointing.Reviewed on Nintendo Switch.

The well-paced difficulty ramp made progression enjoyable for newcomers, while countless endgame challenges kept expert hunters coming back for more. Monster Hunter Rise\u2019s gameplay often attempts to copy World\u2019s success, which isn\u2019t always a bad thing. Battles continue to be an exhilarating dance with death, gear customization is satisfying, and coordinating hunts with friends makes for awesome fun and unexpected outcomes. Even with the introduction of new mechanics that help amplify these features, Monster Hunter Rise struggles to establish a creative identity of its own.Encounters with huge and impressive beasts is the centerpiece of the experience, putting your skills with the myriad weapon types to the test. Once victorious, you spend your downtime sprinting around the main hub, upgrading or forging better equipment, nabbing a bunch of pending quests from NPCs, and meticulously preparing for the next hunt. This captures the fundamentals of the fantasy-action series, but Monster Hunter Rise doesn\u2019t venture far beyond that comfort zone.During the opening hours, the people of Kamura Village are busy preparing for the \u201ccalamity,\u201d an army of wild monsters hell-bent on laying waste to everything in their path. As the village\u2019s newly registered hunter, you must slay or capture numerous creatures in the biomes beyond your hometown\u2019s steel gates. As soon as you\u2019re done marveling at the blooming cherry blossom trees and humming along to the gorgeous score, be sure to grab key consumables from your ever-expanding item box, eat a delicious meal at the local eatery for exclusive bonuses, and venture forth into the unknown. This routine has a comfortable monotony that Monster Hunter fans will likely appreciate, but the addition of the \u201cBuddy Plaza\u201d adds a new feature to your return trips.The Buddy Plaza is a base of operations for your palicoes and palamutes (cat and dog warriors, respectively). You can send your trusty pets on missions of their own to procure miscellaneous crafting materials, spend currency to train them so that they\u2019ll be more effective in future engagements, swap out their equipment, or hire even more of them by talking to the handler. Buddies are extremely versatile, and Monster Hunter: Rise constantly rewards you for using the plaza\u2019s various facilities. Still grinding for that rare beak or tail? Your palico \u201cmeowcenaries\u201d might surprise you with one from a recent expedition. This kind of positive feedback gives the lulls between combat/exploration some much-needed flavor.The environments are visually arresting, and house entire ecosystems filled to the brim with endemic life as well as hard-to-find secrets. My two favorite locales \u2013 Shrine Ruins and Flooded Forest \u2013 are littered with the remnants of ancient civilizations; they have huts wrapped in thick vines and sky-piercing pyramids that loom in the distance. While roaming, I often thought about the histories of these forsaken settlements and the people that once called them home. However, my imagination was often all I had to go on, since the lack of meaningful story beats makes the plot fall flat.A generic tower defense mode serves as a\u00a0lackluster reminder of the larger narrative; these jarring \u201crampage quests\u201d involve constructing an array of automated turrets and mountable ballistae around the village\u2019s gates.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2286c58c-97be-4c7c-8893-3d1f296c17c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2286c58c-97be-4c7c-8893-3d1f296c17c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "108ebf88-e41b-435d-9401-64cadcec8766", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f005c59b923726f6ee5364d8c1e69e8ad20140586b39c7b9a8c81c77bbce208d"}, "3": {"node_id": "317554d9-d6f7-42df-9770-a319feca79ca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f0488105fe77a51899304757b086fca39e3e6f29119da4388576ff004ca0681"}}, "hash": "a39823fc96e211819f7afe49be3f911f7133ed82a8ab31efd23fc527c52b3c83", "text": "Waves of monsters clutter the screen and work together to pummel you while also breaking through your defenses. All the enemies are damage sponges, and clearing the arena hardly requires much thought; I often just held the fire button until I was the last one standing. Thankfully, you aren\u2019t required to complete a ton of rampage quests to gain access to Monster Hunter Rise\u2019s main missions.You spend most of your playthrough experiencing the classic loop: Battle gigantic adversaries like the feral Arzuros and Lagombi, collect mundane items, and deliver heavy objects to camp. Be sure to explore the nooks and crannies of every map as floating, colorful birds called \u201cSpiribirds\u201d can be absorbed to increase your health, stamina, attack, or defense. These buffs make completing the above-mentioned missions much easier. Don\u2019t want to do all of that on foot? Ride your palamute to expedite navigation or whip out your wirebug to scale cliffsides and mountain ranges in seconds.Wirebug attacks, called Silkbinds, add a new layer of intensity to the action. When used repeatedly, Silkbinds force monsters into a mountable state. These short combat sequences are all about using a monster\u2019s power against them by ramming into nearby structures for stagger damage or sprinting towards other unsuspecting adversaries to dish out the pain. Wyvern-riding is my favorite mechanic because it adds an exciting burst of strategy to the franchise\u2019s age-old combat system.Beyond mounting monsters and using the wirebug to wall-run in spectacular fashion, not much else distinguishes Monster Hunter Rise from the installments that came before. It has enough endgame content to keep you occupied long after the credits roll (if you don\u2019t mind copious amounts of grinding) and multiplayer is still the optimal way to play, but the excitement of my early hunts waned before long. Monster Hunter Rise is far from being the next definitive chapter in the series. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re looking for a polished-but-conventional adventure with a few small-scale nuances, then you\u2019ll be right at home in Kamura Village.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

For Rise specifically, this Switch exclusivity window gave Capcom time to add in the game\u2019s ending \u2014 which was unfinished at launch \u2014 and a handful of fan-favorite beasts. But with Monster Hunter Rise getting a barely noticeable visual upgrade on PC, I found myself disappointed by what this re-release could\u2019ve been: a more impressive version of an already excellent game.Where World was a sprawling adventure on a new continent, Rise offers a more compact game, taking place in a Japanese-inspired village called Kamura. Players spend dozens of hours hunting beasts in an attempt to unravel the mystery of why monsters are going into a rage and attacking their hometown \u2014 something the creatures haven\u2019t done since the elders of the village were young.\n    Related\n  The new Wirebug mechanic in Rise makes it the most mobile and accessible game in a series known for being inaccessible \u2014 and helped land it on Polygon\u2019s best games of 2021 list. It\u2019s filled with interesting choices, like the bizarre tower defense mode that\u2019s surprisingly fun to puzzle out, or the musical Japanese intros for each monster. And with the Switch\u2019s ability to swap between TV and handheld play, it felt like something I could play for hours on a flight, or dedicate weeks to on my couch after a major update.Of course, all of this is present in Rise\u2019s PC version (the portability being the exception). But it doesn\u2019t feel enhanced for the more powerful system. It may have an uncapped framerate and high graphics settings \u2014 the latter of which my PC cleared easily \u2014 but at the end of the day, it still looks like a Nintendo Switch game.Monster Hunter Rise looks great on the Switch, especially in handheld mode. It was extremely impressive on Nintendo\u2019s less powerful hardware, implementing the wide open maps of Monster Hunter World rather than the segmented ones from the previous handheld titles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "317554d9-d6f7-42df-9770-a319feca79ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "317554d9-d6f7-42df-9770-a319feca79ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "2286c58c-97be-4c7c-8893-3d1f296c17c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a39823fc96e211819f7afe49be3f911f7133ed82a8ab31efd23fc527c52b3c83"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c7a32e2-7e14-490e-8274-f622d69bb122", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e94996afe5e6ceab932c776f9a1e5ffe1f4706fe526eabed5ce5d9625ec2c9c3"}}, "hash": "5f0488105fe77a51899304757b086fca39e3e6f29119da4388576ff004ca0681", "text": "It was only easy to notice the game\u2019s faults or lack of detail in a screenshot, or when I was idling in town. But it\u2019s much easier to see those imperfections on more impressive hardware.I see the blurriness in Monster Hunter Rise constantly on my PC, inherent to an art style originally designed for Switch. The game\u2019s opening cutscene just looks fuzzy, even on the highest setting, and the look continues into the actual gameplay. And when I\u2019m running around Kamura village or hunting down a monster, I\u2019m often easily distracted by a flat-looking rock or a smooth wall. You don\u2019t notice how fuzzy a PlayStation 2 game looks when you\u2019re playing on a TV from the 2000s; you all but feel the whiplash when playing a PS2 game on an HD monitor. Jumping from Switch to PC with Rise is reminiscent of that feeling. But in venturing out on hunts in the game\u2019s first two biomes, I didn\u2019t run into any performance issues. I was also able to train and upgrade my gear without any problems \u2014 on PC, the game runs very well. The issue isn\u2019t that this is a bad version of Monster Hunter Rise, it\u2019s that it\u2019s the same exact experience as it was in 2021. It may be on a more powerful platform now, but Rise can\u2019t shake its history on Switch.For PC-only players who\u2019ve been dying to play since last March, Rise on PC will still show you a good time. In fact, with all of the post-game updates already out for the PC version and an expansion coming to both platforms this summer, you\u2019ll likely have a better first year with Rise than Switch players did. Everything I originally loved about Rise is still here \u2014 the monsters, the world, the atmosphere \u2014 and it\u2019s bound to get a well-deserved second life on Steam. Patient Monster Hunter fans who never bought a Switch will finally be able to dive into their favorite series, tackling some new monsters and discovering different systems. Far more importantly, this PC launch is an opportunity to introduce new players to the franchise with Rise\u2019s friendlier mechanics.But it\u2019s because of this influx of new players that I wish the PC version would\u2019ve improved on the excellent framework Capcom built on Switch. Without cross-save between the Switch and PC, or visuals that improve on what players already have on a handheld system, it\u2019s hard to see why anyone who\u2019s already sunk hundreds of hours into Rise would jump ship for Steam. Monster Hunter Rise on PC is just a different way to play a fantastic game. And while that\u2019s great news for PC players who\u2019ve never bought into Nintendo\u2019s ecosystem, its graphics fail to impress, even on the most impressive of hardware.

Its PC port makes it the definitive version of one of 2021's best gamesBy \n    Richard Wakeling\n   on January 11, 2022 at 9:37AM PSTThe locations you explore in Monster Hunter Rise have already felt the delicate touch of humanity's hand. Traditional Japanese torii can be found weaving through mountainside paths, leading to sacred shrines, while decaying temples have been reclaimed by nature as local plant life envelops the aging architecture. Signs of human life can even be found at the base of a raging volcano and in the midst of a flooded forest, where a Mesoamerican-style pyramid dominates the landscape.If 2018's Monster Hunter World was all about unearthing a new continent as an intrepid frontiersman, then Rise is a triumphant return to the Old World with valuable lessons learned.

World coalesced both the single and multiplayer parts of the experience into one cohesive whole, but Rise reverts back to the old ways by splitting them into disparate Village and Hub quests. Village quests can only be played alone, while Hub quests can still be tackled solo but are designed with multiple players in mind. This isn't the most welcome setup for newcomers since it isn't immediately clear which quests progress the story, nor is there any indication of whether or not you should be alternating between both paths. The impact this structure has on the game isn't as substantial as it initially seems, though. Hunting the same monster multiple times has always been a part of Monster Hunter's DNA, so repeating the same mission as both a Village and Hub quest is something you would typically seek out anyway.That's not to say Rise isn't approachable in other areas either. There's a renewed focus on fast-paced action that strikes an impressive balance between being welcoming for newcomers and satisfying for battle-hardened veterans. When entering a location, for example, your trusty pet Cahoot will mark all of the nearby monsters on your map. You won't immediately know the identity of each one until you've already discovered them, but this cuts down on the time it takes to seek out your foe and gets you into the heart of the action much faster. It's an ideal fit for the Switch's handheld mode, allowing you to jump in and out of its most thrilling moments without having to engage with the long-winded slog to find and follow a monster's tracks.Exploration is still a key part of the experience, even if you know the exact location of your prey. There are plenty of shortcuts and hidden paths to uncover within each location, and the addition of local wildlife--known as Endemic Life--encourages you to seek out every nook and cranny in order to gain the temporary buffs to damage output, stamina regeneration, and so on, that they offer. On the flip side, if you're not interested in boosting specific stats to get a leg up in battle, you can always ignore the Endemic Life and tailor the challenge to your liking. Rise offers a degree of flexibility in the way you're able to tackle each monster that goes beyond your choice of weapon and armor.With that being said, the verticality afforded by the new Wirebug mechanic has the most significant impact on Rise's exploration. This exciting new tool allows you to zip through the air by utilizing what's known as Wire-dashing. From here, you can chain moves together, mixing in wall runs with additional Wire-dashes to reach previously unattainable heights and traverse the environment at a rapid pace. The finesse it requires takes some getting used to, and you still need to be shrewd with the Wirebug's forgiving cooldown to be successful, but it's an incredibly fun tool to use once you're comfortable with its demands.There's a renewed focus on fast-paced action that strikes an impressive balance between being welcoming for newcomers and satisfying for battle-hardened veterans.The Wirebug also plays an important role in combat, as each of Rise's 14 signature weapons has its own Silkbind attacks. These unique moves are relatively easy to pull off and range from a timing-based counter with the Long Sword to an uppercut leading into an explosive downward strike with the Switch Axe. Each Silkbind attack can be linked into different combos, opening up your repertoire of potential techniques, and the Wirebug expands on this even further with its defensive maneuvers. The evasive Wirefall move, for instance, gives you an opportunity to get back on your feet and avoid a monster's follow-up attack after being knocked down or pushed back, while the Wire-dash extends the reach of your dodge for when you need to quickly evade a rampaging beast.Aside from the addition of Silkbind attacks, each of Rise's weapon types have remarkable depth in keeping with the series' traditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5dcde705-a1f8-449a-88fc-44116b2d02f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "5dcde705-a1f8-449a-88fc-44116b2d02f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c7a32e2-7e14-490e-8274-f622d69bb122", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e94996afe5e6ceab932c776f9a1e5ffe1f4706fe526eabed5ce5d9625ec2c9c3"}, "3": {"node_id": "a324d43f-35ac-4523-a6bc-1ee1ccd89bdf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d75c8bcaa082ddc807b74e4d33ffde8780d8b21c1a03350356e7a6d2920ba791"}}, "hash": "8c5e2c86a91b6bf4e34b7974784266448958edd5ebc3cd8f4dc4525c6ac12b5c", "text": "Mastering a particular weapon is just as rewarding as before, and there's also an element of customization available this time around too. The aptly named Switch Skills allow you to swap out certain regular and Silkbind attacks to make a weapon that's reflective of your play style and preferences. An improved training area, and a reduction in the amount of materials necessary to upgrade a new weapon, also makes this aspect of the game more approachable for newcomers who need to experiment in order to find a weapon type that suits them.Stamina and weapon sharpness have also been streamlined thanks to the addition of Palemutes. These new dog-like buddies will help you out in combat and can be decked out with weapons that only add to Rise's combat depth, and they also act as mounts for you to ride any time you want. Stamina isn't consumed when you're on the back of your trusted Palemute, and you can even sharpen your weapon while traversing to give you something productive to do during travel, thus alleviating some of the more time-consuming aspects of Monster Hunter.Multiplayer is also a hassle-free experience, whether you're playing with a group of friends or with up to three strangers. The wait times are relatively short when joining an online hunt, and lag is a non-issue on Nintendo\u2019s new online infrastructure. The frame rate holds up, too, even when the screen is awash with multiple hunters, particle effects, and the beasts themselves. And this is to say nothing of how good Rise is as a multiplayer game. There\u2019s nothing else quite like gathering a party to go and hunt down an imposing adversary, and Rise\u2019s new features only add to the inherent joy you can glean from its hectic cooperative action. Not to mention the fact that it gives support-oriented weapons--such as the reworked Hunter Horn--time to shine.There is a basic story that sets all of this up by casting you as Kamura Village's sole hunter, but the narrative is little more than a paper-thin vehicle for introducing Rise's new mechanics and game modes. Chief among the latter is the Rampage: a special mission type that requires you to defend a stronghold from waves of ferocious monsters. The Rampage is inspired by Japanese folklore and the Hyakki Yagy\u014d \"Night Parade of One Hundred Demons\" idiom in particular, which sees an uncontrollable horde of yokai march into our world. In gameplay terms, the Rampage is similar to a tower defense game, tasking you with placing various hunting installations around each stronghold in order to repel the frenzied invaders. Some of these installations are automatic and manned by NPC companions, while others can be manually controlled if you fancy dishing out some damage of your own with ballistas, cannons, and other heavy weaponry.Rampage quests offer a respite from the usual Monster Hunter formula, delivering histrionic thrills as you find yourself bombarded by multiple monsters at once. There's some satisfying depth to it as well, with progression rewarding you with more powerful installations and upgraded weapons. You can even jump into the action as you would on any other monster hunt, or lure the enemy to specific points on the battlefield to unleash devastating attacks with powerful installations like the Dragonator and the Splitting Wyvernshot. Completing a Rampage quest will reward you with the usual assortment of monster parts with which to craft weapons and armor, but you're also incentivized to finish them in order to unlock Defender Tickets. These can be spent on numerous Rampage Skills that permanently boost specific weapons stats such as attack, affinity, and defense.Part of what makes the Rampage so exciting is the addition of Wyvern Riding to your offensive arsenal. Monster riding was first introduced in Monster Hunter 4, but it's had a significant shakeup in Rise. By performing a series of Silkbind and aerial attacks, a monster will enter a mountable state that allows you to hop on their back and go for a ride. You can launch your helpless prey into walls to deal damage and put them in a downed state that leaves them vulnerable for a time, or you can use them as a massive battering ram to attack other monsters. This is a tad cumbersome due to some stiff controls, but being able to ravage the monster you're hunting with another beast is a singular treat that adds a tinge of kaiju-esque action to the proceedings--not to mention the strategic considerations it introduces to each hunt. Monsters will occasionally bump into each other and fight over territory, but you can also use Wyvern Riding to seek out another monster and force them into a confrontation, creating emergent moments that enhance the game's core combat.The monsters themselves consist of fan favorites such as Rathian, Diablos, and Puki-Puki, along with plenty of new monsters and a few surprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a324d43f-35ac-4523-a6bc-1ee1ccd89bdf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a324d43f-35ac-4523-a6bc-1ee1ccd89bdf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "5dcde705-a1f8-449a-88fc-44116b2d02f3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c5e2c86a91b6bf4e34b7974784266448958edd5ebc3cd8f4dc4525c6ac12b5c"}, "3": {"node_id": "9424be57-c727-44ec-adca-bc4bc5054560", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "abdf79d506b68b4eec177bbaa2943fbefbb92f4062b1d31fe25bd5e329dee8da"}}, "hash": "d75c8bcaa082ddc807b74e4d33ffde8780d8b21c1a03350356e7a6d2920ba791", "text": "Much like the Rampage, each of the new beasts are inspired by yokai and other legendary creatures from Japanese folklore. The menacing Somnacath, for example, is based on Japanese mermaids, which have the lower body of a fish and the upper body of a demon. It's a fascinating creature to fight as it moves through the water like a sea otter before putting you to sleep with its siren's song. Bishaten, on the other hand, is inspired by tengu, presenting an ape-like monster with the face of a crow and a dangerous tail the shape of tengu's fan. Aside from using its rear appendage to deal damage, the Bishaten also throws large pieces of fruit at you, making it one of the more peculiar monsters in the bestiary.Going toe-to-toe with these intimidating beasts is the unmistakable core of the Monster Hunter experience, and Rise still feels like a distinctly Monster Hunter game, even if it's more of a fully-fledged action title than any other entry in the series. This renewed focus doesn't diminish its layered RPG mechanics, nor does it dumb down on any single aspect of the hunt. Certain changes make Rise a more approachable game for newcomers, but you also have the freedom to tailor the experience to your liking. The moment-to-moment combat is as impeccable as it's ever been and puts Rise on a pedestal as one of the feathers in the Nintendo Switch's cap.Monster Hunter Rise was one of 2021's best games. It still delivered the quintessential Monster Hunter experience of killing increasingly large monsters with increasingly powerful weapons, but Capcom also stripped away a lot of the fat to deliver the most dynamic and accessible entry in the series thus far. After almost a year of Nintendo Switch exclusivity, Rise has now made its way to PC with a souped-up port that improves on what was already a fantastic game in almost every way.The most obvious improvements are, of course, visual, as it comes with all of the bells and whistles you would expect from a snazzy PC port. The addition of high-quality textures results in a sharper and more detailed image even when bumping the resolution up to 4K, and the system requirements are lenient enough that you can get it running at 60fps or higher with every graphical setting maxed out on even moderate hardware. There are a few new graphical settings like motion blur and depth of field that can be toggled on or off to add an extra layer of fidelity, and support for ultra-wide monitors is also included. It's incredibly well-optimized right out of the box, too, which wasn't the case when Monster Hunter World launched on PC back in 2018. Rise isn't as hardware intensive, but it's always nice when you don't have to wait for post-launch patches for a game to reach its full potential.Monster Hunter has always had a deliberate pace, especially during combat where timing your moves and their locked animations is an essential skill. As such, the increase in performance afforded by the PC version isn't a game-changer, although it's still difficult to return to the Switch release after experiencing Rise at a buttery smooth frame rate. The new wirebug mechanic completely alters the flow of traversal and exploration by letting you effortlessly zip around the environment, and it's here where the unlocked frame rate really shines. Rise is also a much snappier game than its predecessors, and the PC version's faster load times take this a step further by getting you into the action almost instantaneously.Keyboard and mouse support is also robust, letting you set shortcuts and new key bindings until it's palatable on something other than a gamepad. If you are using a controller, however, the gyro-aiming found in the Switch version is absent here, despite the PC port being compatible with both the Switch Pro controller and the PS5's DualSense. You're not going to miss it if this is your first time playing Rise, but for those who became accustomed to tilting the controller when soaring above the ground with the wirebug, it might take a while to acclimatize to solely using the right stick again.If you did play Rise on the Switch and are wondering whether the PC version is worth picking up, one of the most significant aspects you'll have to take into consideration is the absence of cross-play and cross-save. Capcom is unable to implement these features for both Rise and its upcoming Sunbreak expansion, so if you've already invested hours into depleting Kamura's monster population, you'll have to do it all over again if you want those visual and performance boosts.Fortunately, there is some new content to sink your teeth into if you haven't played the Switch version in a while and are making the jump to PC.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9424be57-c727-44ec-adca-bc4bc5054560": {"__data__": {"id_": "9424be57-c727-44ec-adca-bc4bc5054560", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "a324d43f-35ac-4523-a6bc-1ee1ccd89bdf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d75c8bcaa082ddc807b74e4d33ffde8780d8b21c1a03350356e7a6d2920ba791"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8b4d946-8da7-4072-bec0-8a572964ebf8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c5c9b24d879a49b7d28911ae1bd24b3cbdf27133e5904b9ae66eba58a5a4f41"}}, "hash": "abdf79d506b68b4eec177bbaa2943fbefbb92f4062b1d31fe25bd5e329dee8da", "text": "All of Rise's free post-launch content is included up to version 3.6.1, with tougher apex monster variants to hunt and special event quests that feature collaborations with the likes of Okami, Street Fighter, Mega Man, and Sonic the Hedgehog. Capcom is also planning on syncing content between the Switch and PC versions at the end of February, so the PC won't be lagging behind when new content drops. Meanwhile, the Sunbreak expansion is scheduled to launch on both Switch and PC at the same time when it releases sometime this summer.Monster Hunter: Rise is still a technical marvel on Switch, but the graphical and performance enhancements present in this PC port make it the definitive version of one of 2021's best games. It will even retain its portability if you're planning on picking up a Steam Deck later this year. For those who already own Rise on Switch, picking up the PC version will come down to how willing you are to replay the game from the beginning. For everyone else, it should be a no-brainer.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:Helping new players adjust quickly, giving veteran players a way to flex their skillsThe movement in Monster Hunter Rise finally clicked for me as I soared above the Lagombi\u2019s head.The Lagombi is an obnoxious Monster Hunter beast, a bearlike critter that slides on its belly at high speeds. When it would slide, I would dodge, but it didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that I wasn\u2019t doing a good job. Movements left and right were too slow; I needed to think vertically. I started anticipating the Lagombi\u2019s slides even before I finished the first fight. Then I used my new Wirebug to soar into the sky and hang high above my prey below. The beast tired itself out looking for me, and I fell from the heavens and hit the monster with a massive blow from my hammer. This is not the Monster Hunter of Monster Hunter: World. Rise is faster \u2014 players have far more in-game mobility, and it\u2019s an even better starting place for new Hunters. The Monster Hunter series is known for being unfriendly to newcomers, with deliberate combat and loads of complex menus to navigate. Players gather resources, take on lengthy boss fights with energetic monsters, and skin their prey to make better gear for the next hunt. The series is slow-moving, a trait that offers finesse to players who master its timing, but can throw off newbies trying to survive their first hunt. The Wirebug \u2014 a living creature that gives you the ability to dash through the sky like Spider-Man  \u2014 changes that. The X button takes me straight into the air, and A dashes me forward while holding the ZL trigger on my Switch. I can also hold ZL to aim my Wirebug more precisely, hitting ZR when I\u2019m ready to fly a short distance. I can press A in midair to hang from a Wirebug indefinitely, or B after getting hit by a monster to get myself back on my feet. The variety in movement options offers a level of finesse I\u2019ve never had in a Monster Hunter game before.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

I have two Wirebugs when I start a hunt. I can use them back to back to dash twice as far, or just one at a time to get myself in the air for a quick strike. I can climb a mountain by alternating between zipping and running up the side. The Wirebug opens up the entire map as playable space, instead of the prebuilt alleyways and arenas from previous games where I can battle beasts and collect mushrooms. This mobility helps give Rise a more modern feel than its predecessors. Instead of lying on the ground after a big hit, I can use my Wirebug to recover in midair. It lets me pull myself to safety and heal before the monster can catch me again. I don\u2019t only have to choose between dodging left or right; I can also dodge up. I can escape a fight by scaling a mountain, or follow a retreating monster by zipping over some buildings.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8b4d946-8da7-4072-bec0-8a572964ebf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8b4d946-8da7-4072-bec0-8a572964ebf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "9424be57-c727-44ec-adca-bc4bc5054560", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "abdf79d506b68b4eec177bbaa2943fbefbb92f4062b1d31fe25bd5e329dee8da"}, "3": {"node_id": "2bfa1e82-68f1-44eb-8dc6-ea1d57ccc633", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e066c4e108d24e4148d5a17d87d09f14145756be6645ddb5cb1b1d3fc83dda28"}}, "hash": "1c5c9b24d879a49b7d28911ae1bd24b3cbdf27133e5904b9ae66eba58a5a4f41", "text": "I have more chances to save myself from the often brutal enemy AI. But that mobility cuts both ways. As it lowers Rise\u2019s skill floor, it also raises the skill ceiling, allowing for incredible plays. I started Rise using the Wirebug just to dodge and recover, but it didn\u2019t take me long to learn how to zip around fights and bash on the monster from creative angles. I can zip to dodge an attack, dodge again in midair, and bring my hammer down on the monster\u2019s head with a crack. It\u2019s a satisfying feeling, being in complete control of my movements.The Wirebug gets even more complex. I can spend my Wirebug charges to do powerful Silkbind moves, which deal a special kind of damage that tires monsters and allows me to ride them.Monster Hunter: World allowed me to ride on a monster\u2019s back and knock it over to damage it. But Wyvern Riding, the new mounting system in Rise, is something else entirely. When I climb aboard my monster, I\u2019m no longer a Hunter from the small village of Kamura. I am the Tigrex or the Magnamalo, and I can use this powerful body to deal some major damage. This breaks up the monotony of the 20- to 30-minute hunts that new players go through \u2014 but, like all things in Rise, it also allows veterans to prove their skills. The Wirebug changes the entire pace of Rise. Monsters attack faster because I can dodge faster. Areas are more vertical because I have the means to climb hills, mountains, buildings, cliffs, and bluffs. It\u2019s freeing, and it makes Monster Hunter: World \u2014 barely three years old and the current gold standard for accessible monster hunting games \u2014 seem archaic and slow by comparison.The Wirebug creates a host of gameplay opportunities outside of Monster Hunter\u2019s minute-to-minute combat, and Rise\u2019s new Rampage mode is perhaps the best example of what\u2019s now possible. Rampage is a tower defense quest that takes place in a variety of arenas, all situated around the village of Kamura. A horde of monsters is attacking your home, and you need to fend them off. All of Rise\u2019s improvements make its ending that much more disappointing. Without getting into specifics, the game ends very abruptly prior to its planned April update, which Capcom says will add a few monsters and uncap the Hunter Rank system. With the end of the story scheduled to arrive about a month after launch, and Monster Hunter games taking 40 hours or so to finish, this may not be an issue that will impact many hunters. But it\u2019s worth knowing what you\u2019re signing up for if you\u2019re a hardcore player.Rampages play out in the game\u2019s normal third-person perspective. But the arenas are huge, and the distance between where I am and where I need to be makes walking feel far too slow. I need to zip up and around the map to set up turrets and level up my base as I progress. The arenas have to be large to accommodate the size of some of these monsters, so a tower defense mode like this wouldn\u2019t work without the Wirebug\u2019s added mobility. The freedom to fly from one turret to the next prevents Rampages from ever being dull, and leaves me juggling turret repairs and setting new traps for the monsters \u2014 a welcome departure from the more structured hunts.Despite my Wirebug zipping, Rise is still Monster Hunter at its core. It still offers those bullshit moments, like watching helplessly as your Hunter gets carted back to town because you couldn\u2019t get them up fast enough. These are the kind of frustrations that cause Monster Hunter vets to look at you and shrug because ... yeah, that\u2019ll happen. Rise\u2019s more modern sensibilities don\u2019t eliminate deaths that feel unfair or stuns that seem too long. The monster should be able to knock me out the same way I can knock it out, by Monster Hunter\u2019s own philosophy. But Rise is another moment of growth in the series. The bullshit still exists, and the monsters still frustrate, but new players won\u2019t run into these nuisances as often as they used to, because now they have more tools to save themselves with. Monster Hunter Rise takes the accessible foundation that Capcom built in World and expands on it without breaking what makes Monster Hunter fun, including the deep combat and the feeling of progression as you defeat, skin, and wear one monster to fight the next. If World was the first step forward into a new era of Monster Hunter, Rise takes it even further.

The Switch missed out on the fun, but a game specifically for that system (and PC sometime next year), Monster Hunter Rise, has been in co-development and is finally about to release.Since Capcom created Rise concurrently with Monster Hunter: World, players can expect many similarities. It has the same open-world design, which has players hunting monsters on one expansive map. The gameplay is similar as well, with all 14 weapon types carrying over and controlling almost exactly the same. When it comes to the core loop of hunting monsters, crafting gear, and hunting stronger monsters, Rise feels more like an expansion to World than a new game.However, the transition to weaker hardware hasn\u2019t done the series any favors. It runs smooth, which is a testament to Capcom\u2019s development skills, but it does so at the cost of some of the smaller details that make Monster Hunter: World such an engaging title. However, it does include a few new mechanics that somewhat make up for this.Rise takes players to Kamura Village and runs with a Japanese motif for the hub area. The story is a lot lighter this time around as you\u2019re not exploring a whole new continent. Instead, you\u2019re just a Kamura Village hunter who is just starting their career. Instead of chasing down Zorah Magederos and discovering the mystery behind the Elder Dragons\u2019 migration, you\u2019re just trying to keep your village safe.In Rise, Kamura Village is put in danger by a phenomenon called \u201cThe Rampage.\u201d For some reason, monsters in the surrounding areas are becoming more aggressive and sometimes even attacking the town in waves. This part of the story gives players access to a new survival-type mode where you have to defend the village from attack. Before and during the attack, you can set up defensive positions and give orders to NPCs. Solving the mystery behind these attacks is a big part of the plot, which seems to mostly exist in this game as an impetus for you to hunt monsters.Kamura Village is much more compact than Astera or Seliana, which makes navigation easier. However, I found myself missing the hustle and bustle of the two hubs found in Monster Hunter: World. I also missed the hook in World that we were researching the beasts we were killing or capturing. It gave a deeper purpose behind hunting than, \u201cOh, that monster is causing a ruckus!\u201d Kamura Village has a cool aesthetic, and the NPCs are likable; it just feels like a step backward.Because the game is on the Switch, a console that many people play on the go, there are some changes to gameplay to make hunts more streamlined. For one, you no longer have to discover major monsters to track them on the map. Cahoots, the new owl companion that replaces Scoutflies, automatically places markers for each major monster on the map. The icons don\u2019t initially tell you which creature is which, but this eliminates the need to follow tracks and environmental clues to find major monsters.The Palamutes are one of two big additions to the game, and stand alongside the Felynes as companions. These new dog buddies fight alongside you in battle, but most importantly, you can ride them on hunts. Being able to ride Palamutes basically puts each hunt into turbo mode because they\u2019re significantly faster than the player character, and you expend no stamina when you\u2019re riding them. You can use many items while on your Palamute, like the Whetstone, rations, and potions, which means you can get prepared to fight while traveling to your target.Hunters also get a new tool to use in Rise, the Wirebug, which acts as an evolution of the Clutch Claw introduced in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eceef2d3-5df9-456c-b421-a8a879ff81ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "eceef2d3-5df9-456c-b421-a8a879ff81ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "2bfa1e82-68f1-44eb-8dc6-ea1d57ccc633", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e066c4e108d24e4148d5a17d87d09f14145756be6645ddb5cb1b1d3fc83dda28"}, "3": {"node_id": "2746f746-3c4e-42d6-b715-49354a083578", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2eebb0904387d3d2c9efc695cf0a42a503802e0a38ace24fb8ab9530931a3500"}}, "hash": "63353361619a45531be4789e09526281f472737cae39f467d518815b45d3bca1", "text": "This tool lets you launch into the air to dodge an enemy attack quickly or to traverse gaps. It also allows for more verticality, as you can use Wirebug charges in quick succession to climb to places you otherwise couldn\u2019t reach.The Wirebug also introduces the Silkbinding mechanic. The Wirebug can be used in conjunction with your main weapon to produce new combos. These combos, when landed correctly, can snare a monster, allowing you to engage in Wyvern Riding. However, Wyvern Riding can also be made possible when a monster gets knocked down during a Turf War, something that is more common in Rise than in World.Wyvern Riding allows you to mount a monster, and instead of just attacking them, you get a limited amount of control over them. You can use strong and weak attacks on an enemy or cause the monster to slam itself into the nearest wall. There\u2019s also a gauge you can fill up by evading or landing attacks when Wyvern Riding that allow you to execute a Mounted Punisher attack which causes major damage to an opponent.Because of the increased opportunity to do damage with Wyvern Riding, hunts are typically over much quicker in Rise. Fights later in the game are still tough, but some of the monsters that were challenging for early players in World, like the Pukei-Pukei, are much easier to take down.While Rise nails the fundamental gameplay of Monster Hunter, it feels lacking when it comes to worldbuilding. One of the things that drew me into Monster Hunter: World is how thought out each monster\u2019s place in the environment is. I loved that you had to track monsters, spying out footprints, disturbed plantlife, and excrement.Unfortunately, though the maps are large in Monster Hunter Rise, they don\u2019t feel quite as natural as those found in World. Rise\u2019s locations feel more like video game maps, with medium-sized arenas to fight monsters in connected by narrower corridors. There are less shortcuts and cramped passages than in World, which leaves each map with a constructed feeling.The amount of endemic life also seems to be toned down. Instead of having a ton of critters to capture in nets and collect, most of the endemic life is are either items to pick up (Dung Beetles), instant use (Flashbugs), or the new Spiritbirds that buff you as you collect them.Most players likely won\u2019t notice that Rise puts less emphasis on worldbuilding, but it was disappointing to me. Rise has great gameplay, but there\u2019s a lot more emphasis on the hunt. It\u2019s likely a side effect of the game being on Switch more than anything, which makes me wish that it was a second expansion to Monster Hunter: World rather than a separate title.Capcom did an amazing job distilling the gameplay experience of Monster Hunter: World into a streamlined form for the Nintendo Switch. Hunts are easier to get into and faster to complete, but they still give the challenge that fans loved from previous games. There\u2019s also just enough new mechanics to make Rise feel like a step forward, even if it\u2019s only a small one.Fans who love Monster Hunter exclusively for the hunts will likely welcome the raised emphasis on taking on major monsters as quickly as possible. However, Rise is missing some of the worldbuilding of Monster Hunter: World, which will make it feel a bit emptier for players who prefer to stop and smell the roses.9Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

But Monster Hunter Rise\u00a0has so much personality, and adds several key mechanics into the mix, that it elicits far more joy than suffering, so long as you\u2019re willing to work with it.As is the case with most entries, Rise\u00a0once again tasks players with literally hunting down various big bad beasties, with a variety of weapons and playstyles. Once you\u2019ve bested them, you can skin them for parts, gear up, upgrade, and repeat the process; solo, or with friends. You do this until you kill a really big monster in the main storyline, then kill more monsters in a postgame.The general flow is still the same. But\u00a0Rise\u00a0has the benefit of working with a very clear theme (feudal Japan) as a\u00a0throughput. Rather than becoming numb to the environments and the game\u2019s hub zone, I embraced them, and started to take notice of all of its colorful nuances. The NPCs grew on me in a way that many hadn\u2019t before! And the beautiful, majestic soundtrack drew me into the world even further.It can still be a slow start. A few of the early monsters are a little bland, as are the ins and outs of early equipment pieces and weapons. But ramp you will, and the creatures \u2014 and their lovely haiku intros \u2014 get even more interesting to look at aesthetically. Even some of the older concepts have a little more flair in Rise, as you witness them in a new light.If you felt like Monster Hunter\u00a0was clunky in the past, the wirebug might change that notion. Think of it like a flavorful grappling hook, which can not only zoom you around the map for exploration purposes, but zip you around in combat as an action-centric dodge. Hunters have access to a recover ability (think fighting games when you get knocked down), which prevents you from getting stunlocked or comboed by enemies, as well as special wirebug moves.It\u2019s up to you to govern your wirebug meter (which refills over time via a cooldown) and decide which enemy attacks are worth recovering from, how much ground you need to cover, and how useful your individual weapon powers are. It\u2019s a neat little metagame that has a relatively low skill floor in terms of picking up the dodge element of the wirebug mechanic, while providing a high ceiling and opening up weapon tech.The Palamute (dog) companion deserves a special shout-out, too. While having a little deadly mutt running around is its own reward, you can ride it\u00a0to get places quickly and chase down monsters. Period. In a game where you might be pursuing a creature four or five times a match, it breaks down the monotony. Riding monsters (who can quickly get from place to place and start bar fights with other creatures) similarly feels straightforward and to the point.Then there\u2019s the rampage missions. These work kind of like a light tower-defense gimmick, allowing hunters to create weapon platforms in specific locations in an arena, as well as spring one-time-use traps or NPC powers. You can opt to pilot a platform (such as a bow gun or a cannon) yourself, or put an NPC in charge. It\u2019s a little streamlined, but it is fun to see a handful of big monsters on-screen while you blow them up with heavy-duty weaponry. It\u2019s more like controlled chaos, but given that the game doesn\u2019t force you to do rampage missions en masse, it works out more like a welcome diversion than a slog.Playing through the \u201cmain story,\u201d you can defeat the Magnamalo in one-on-one combat in around 15 hours. But as all Monster Hunter fans know, the game begins when the credits roll. After that\u2019s said and done you\u2019ll unlock a weapon and start the endgame with higher-rank monsters to hunt. Replaying rampage missions is also a treat, because the general chaos lends itself well to repeat viewings.Beyond that \u201cvillage progress\u201d questline, you\u2019ll have access to the \u201chub progress\u201d branch, which is the meat of the game. This is where you\u2019ll make your way through the ranks fighting near-endless foes; with other people, if you so choose. Although my access to multiplayer was limited prior to launch (it was cut off at one point), Monster Hunter Rise\u00a0is still very fun in terms of group coordination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "287bc300-3baa-4d4f-a378-9ad5340ed414": {"__data__": {"id_": "287bc300-3baa-4d4f-a378-9ad5340ed414", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "2746f746-3c4e-42d6-b715-49354a083578", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2eebb0904387d3d2c9efc695cf0a42a503802e0a38ace24fb8ab9530931a3500"}, "3": {"node_id": "85acc0f0-734d-4c3c-8424-7c60aff5dc6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "419a2d53c4c152489bb4078083596d12dd74ad3c0e8176e75058b3b1fce2b67e"}}, "hash": "133fe7cfe25a5b514d5abc4b8473b542cf19e328b8454e8f66a378478934e9ba", "text": "With the wirebug, seeing everyone zip around is a treat.You also have the fairly deep buddy system to play around with, which operates with its own hub zone, and allows you to recruit more furry friends for off-screen adventures and item rewards.

There\u2019s a good chunk of fun busywork abound if you want a break from hunting. I even found myself rewatching monster intros just to show my wife how cool/silly something looked; I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever done that!Like a lot of Monster Hunter games, I slowly started to get more and more acclimated to Rise\u00a0until I hit a positive tipping point.

Login NowMonster Hunter Rise launches players into the next era of the franchise as it swings back onto the Nintendo Switch with Master Rank expertise.When I heard that the next major chapter of Monster Hunter was going not to the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, or PC (at least not right away), but rather starting out on the Nintendo Switch, I had my reservations. How could one not after the absolutely breathtaking experience that was Monster Hunter World and its expansion, Iceborne? I went into Monster Hunter Rise thinking I just wanted it to be adequate in comparison.I misjudged. Monster Hunter Rise is more than adequate. Its inclusion of familiar and new mechanics and an all-new full-fledged adventure packed with new and returning beasties would be enough to make Monster Hunter Rise of note. That said, the fact that it can bring all of these things to the table and then play proficiently offline and online makes this a must-have for any player looking for a quality and lengthy dragon-slaying adventure you\u2019ll enjoy at home and on the road.Monster Hunter Rise brings players to the hugely far Eastern-inspired village of Kamura. There\u2019s often a great deal of European, bohemian, and naval influence behind the home base settlements of Monster Hunter games, but Monster Hunter Rise makes no bones about the fact that it\u2019s all about ninjas, shrine maidens, and further feudal Japanese iconography. More importantly, Kamura faces a problem. Every fifty years or so, a ruckus known as the Rampage stirs up the wyverns and drives them to attack Kamura in gathering masses. If Kamura is to survive, the Rampage must be driven back and defeated.That\u2019s where you come in! As a budding hunter in Kamura, your task is to build your might, master your weapons and tools in increasingly dangerous hunts, learn to thwart the Rampage, and hunt down its source once and for all.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85acc0f0-734d-4c3c-8424-7c60aff5dc6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "85acc0f0-734d-4c3c-8424-7c60aff5dc6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "287bc300-3baa-4d4f-a378-9ad5340ed414", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "133fe7cfe25a5b514d5abc4b8473b542cf19e328b8454e8f66a378478934e9ba"}, "3": {"node_id": "6963b295-d499-42e2-aaa2-0cfe1274c5f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "69c7ba5d985af9bdaf2aeb3dc93b973e9129abf11d6cc096005c6c8b9dbf5f2b"}}, "hash": "419a2d53c4c152489bb4078083596d12dd74ad3c0e8176e75058b3b1fce2b67e", "text": "As is often the case, the narrative of Monster Hunter is little more than corny buffer to get you to the action, but it does its job well enough. The whole point is getting you ready to hunt bigger and bigger beasties.Now I will say, getting you ready for the hunt is one area where Monster Hunter Rise is tedious and unintuitive. If you\u2019re a seasoned Monster Hunter player, it probably won\u2019t take you long to figure out what you remember, how it works, and the new tricks that go with it. Where it doesn\u2019t do so great is for complete newbies. I\u2019d say the first hour of Monster Hunter Rise is a dizzying array of tutorials that barrage you with information overload. There are some new things you'll need, but it\u2019s still an annoying flood of info rather than thoughtfully training you learn up on what you can do.That aside, nearly all of the staples return, including the 14 classes of weaponry to explore, the eating before a hunt, the sending for supplies, and more. Palicos also return and they even have classes this time, like Healer to keep your health up or Bombardier to dish out explosive damage. They aren\u2019t your only best friend in the lonely wild. Canine hunting partners known as Palamutes also make an entrance this game. These large pups can not only be equipped with special weapons, but you can also ride them like a steed and travel around maps quickly. Heck, while you\u2019re moving on their backs, you can do things like drink a potion or sharpen your weapon on the ride. They're a fantastic addition to the overall solo squad \u2013 so much so that you can only choose to take a Palico or Palamute with you in multiplayer games. Slight bummer.Once you\u2019ve prepped yourself, picked your weapon of choice, and readied to leave camp, you can head for the available locales. At first you just get the Shrine Ruins, but eventually you unlock various environments all with a myriad of opportunities to explore and unique creatures to pick apart for gear crafting materials. I\u2019m not going to sit here and say the locales are as intricately gorgeous as Monster Hunter World\u2019s were, but they are charming in their own right, featuring their own fun variety and style to keep your hunts interesting.The inhabitants that wander these locales are good too. Monster Hunter Rise features the return of a lot familiar creatures, as well as some new challenges to chase down. The likes of Great Izuchi, Aknosom, and Tetranadon join staples like Rathalos, Anjanath, Khezu, and plenty more. Each monster comes into the game in grand form, offering a unique challenge and equipment rewards for overcoming it. Monster Hunter Rise will still make you grind some monsters several times to get what you need, but generally the battles were so fun and intense that I hardly noticed.This is due in large part to several new elements throughout Monster Hunter Rise\u2019s hunts and combat. For one, there\u2019s the Permabuffers. These are bird-like little creatures that embue you with a stat gain if you come near them. There\u2019s Attack, Defense, Stamina, and Health Permabuffers, and you can even equip certain accessories to boost one style of effects or another. It makes your pathing to collect these little critters as paramount as popping a Demondrug potion for attack or an Armorskin potion for defense at the start of the match.Then there\u2019s the Wirebugs. These critters serve several purposes throughout the hunt. For one, you can use a Wirebug like a grappling shot to yank you forward or up to walls. If you hit a wall, you\u2019ll run up it a bit before having to jump and Wirebug grapple again. You can use this to scale cliffs you otherwise couldn\u2019t, and it adds player-controlled verticality to Monster Hunter Rise. There\u2019s also Wirebug attacks. These are done using the Wirebug button with your usual attack buttons. They can do anything from sending out a barrage of silken slashes on the Long Sword to giving you temporary impenetrabale shields against an attack. Some weapons feel more limited or niche with these attacks, but it\u2019s hard to complain about their inclusion on top of the usual move sets.The most delightful part of this is easily setting up Wyvern Riding. Monster Hunter Rise lost regular monster mounting, but by dealing damage with Wirebug attacks, utilizing Puppet Spiders found in the wild, or letting a wyvern get attacked by another wyvern, you can jump to take control of them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6963b295-d499-42e2-aaa2-0cfe1274c5f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6963b295-d499-42e2-aaa2-0cfe1274c5f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "85acc0f0-734d-4c3c-8424-7c60aff5dc6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "419a2d53c4c152489bb4078083596d12dd74ad3c0e8176e75058b3b1fce2b67e"}, "3": {"node_id": "656d55fd-8468-412e-9fb9-0ca2b682fc4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7dbaa43c12ba4ae907daa6527e54269761caa3c8ec0e53eac4e1fd6602706f80"}}, "hash": "69c7ba5d985af9bdaf2aeb3dc93b973e9129abf11d6cc096005c6c8b9dbf5f2b", "text": "In this moment, you can use them to wage a battle on another monster and damage them severely, or you could just launch them into a wall, jump off, and wail on them while they\u2019re recovering. No matter what, Wyvern Riding provides massive opportunities for big damage and stuns and despite regular mountings going away, Wyvern Riding feels highly bombastic and satisfying when you do it right.Finally, there's Rampage Quests. These are gate defending scenarios where you'll ward off several waves of Wyverns with automated and operable ballistas, cannons, machine guns, and bombs. These were basically tower defense sections, and while okay. I didn't really feel one way or the other about them.One of the things I was most concerned about coming into this review was online play in Monster Hunter Rise. Even if Capcom was running the servers, with Nintendo Switch Online, I was expecting very little. So, color me shocked when I hooked up a hunt with my colleague in Australia and the hunt was practically lag free - a completely smooth experience both when I hosted and he hosted a match. I was floored by how well it handled in even the most chaotic hunting moments. All of our hunts ran the same as when I was offline. I will note that Monster Hunter Rise's online menus are a convoluted joke for a game that has been around so long, asking you to do all sorts of extra presses to get to a place that would take one or two buttons in other games, but once I was in a hunt, it was hard to complain.Moreover, the game performed that well in docked and handheld mode for the Nintendo Switch. When I took the Switch off the dock to test it out, I was equally shocked to find it handled nearly as well as when docked. The only noticeable quirk in quality, was that objects at distance (like over fifty feet) are dulled and living entities are choppy in their movements. However, up close and in most combat range, I found the Nintendo Switch handled my exploration and battles with a maintained standard regardless of whether it was docked or not, quite the good news for anyone hoping to hunt on the go.When I think about the problems I have with Monster Hunter Rise\u2026 They are trite in comparison to the overall experience. Most of them are inconveniences that we can learn to deal with in time even if I'd say it's silly they're there at all at this point. Some are just mild ho-hums I wish were better. Overall however, Monster Hunter Rise was beyond anything I expected. The tried and true grind of Monster Hunter's giant beast battles is alive and performing exceedingly well for the Switch\u2019s hardware. Its formula is also thoughtfully augmented with Palamutes, Wirebugs, and Wyvern Riding, all of which I\u2019d love to see stay in the series after this game. Grab a friend, near or far, or make some new ones as you engage in Rise\u2019s grand new hunt. I doubt you\u2019ll be disappointed.This review is based upon a Nintendo Switch digital copy supplied by the publisher.

With a face full of Pukei-Pukei poison and a sumo-wrestling hippo belly-bopping my front door to pieces, my hunter glacially lifts an antidote to his lips just in time to see two more monsters scale the fence in search of mischief. Maybe it\u2019s just not my day. Built from the ground-up for Nintendo Switch with Capcom\u2019s RE Engine, Monster Hunter Rise is a condensed experience, but not necessarily a reduced one, ticking all of the necessary boxes of a modern Monster Hunter, while scaling back some of the scope to deliver a tighter package on a less powerful machine. Despite the technical concessions, Rise still unmistakably feels like Monster Hunter. Where a lot of action games try to make their combat as fluid as possible, Monster Hunter Rise is content to flow as smoothly as frozen nutella spreads, with the same idiosyncratic chunk to all 14 weapons that gives the series its distinctive handling. As always, supping a potion feels like brewing a pot of tea, as your character ambles out of the way of whatever huge and onrushing beast has caused you injury in the first place with all of the urgency of George Martin writing the last Game of Thrones books. It sounds like a nightmare, but in practise it makes for painstakingly deliberate, unblinkingly intense scraps that\u2019re satisfying hefty in just the right way when you eventually click with the right weapon for you.  \n \nHowever, the new Wirebug zipline ability, which has been added for Monster Hunter Rise, adds a bit more freedom, momentum, and impetus to your mobility. By holstering your weapon and holding the left trigger, you can shoot out a Spider-Man-style silk string which pulls you in any direction - including up into the air. It\u2019s a powerful tool for closing the distance with more agile monsters, escaping a sticky situation, or lining up a strong aerial smash which softens up a wyvern for riding. Between this and the unique and flashy Silkbind attacks for each weapon, the Wirebug opens up loads of options for your character not just in combat, but exploration as well, where you can sling yourself into scenery and wall run to higher ground in search of rare materials and secrets.  It feels like a lot of what\u2019s new in Monster Hunter Rise is to do with mobility. The aforementioned wyvern riding, which lets you mount a monster that\u2019s been stunned with Wirebug attacks or through a turf war with another roaming beastie, is deceptively flexible - letting you charge nearly the full way across the map to square up to your target. Yes, it does feel like there\u2019s a full three-second delay between pressing the attack button on the back of a monster and anything happening, but it just wouldn\u2019t be Monster Hunter if you weren\u2019t locked into a grand animation at some point. Then there are the new Palamute buddies - ninja dog friends to me and you - who you can saddle up and ride about whenever you\u2019re in need of a speed boost.  \n \nBeside being incredibly cute, with loads of adorably functional equipment sets for both your doggo and traditional palico cat helper to craft, your buddies are useful partners in battle. You can deck them out to be healers, distract monster aggro away from your hunter, or just focus on extra damage with behavior sets which actually feel like they make some difference. Between these three additions, Capcom has functionally solved the issue in previous games where you had to trudge around wide-open spaces from encounter-to-encounter or to farm materials, without any one thing feeling too overpowered. The story in Monster Hunter Rise is light, but the framing and characterisation of Kamura Village is one of my favorite things about the game. Where Astera in Monster Hunter World felt flat and empty despite its size, your home in Monster Hunter Rise feels emblematic of the game as a whole: condensed to include the series\u2019 fundamentals with not a whole lot else. During the main story there aren\u2019t any purpose-built set-pieces like when you fight Zora Magnaros in Monster Hunter World. In fact, every main mission you embark on is a standard hunt or Rampage. But again, this stripped back presentation isn\u2019t much to the detriment of Rise. It feels like Capcom has conceded that you\u2019re coming to Monster Hunter for deep and nuanced combat, not a deep and nuanced story, and focused on creating somewhere sweet and cosy to kick back between missions, rather than anything more character-led.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbfb5184-6239-4cd2-8dee-680d40bbe535": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbfb5184-6239-4cd2-8dee-680d40bbe535", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "656d55fd-8468-412e-9fb9-0ca2b682fc4c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7dbaa43c12ba4ae907daa6527e54269761caa3c8ec0e53eac4e1fd6602706f80"}, "3": {"node_id": "5f086a93-6ed6-49da-998f-1424f197cd5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67dfea297791331ad2bc1728c33be1173225c850bed363ff93fab5d509da1cd2"}}, "hash": "2fc52136a8b70784e4992b28f693117393d82e0a38fcf2f1fc293c96d9b919c5", "text": "This extends to the hunts themselves where the sedate tracking feature, where you'd have to collect clues pointing you towards a new wyvern's location, has also been shelved in favor of a simple map marker.   \n \nA commonly accepted factor in Monster Hunter World\u2019s breakout success in the West was accessibility, with a greater grounding in complex mechanics offered to new players from the start. Monster Hunter Rise feels like another step in this direction, with your journey towards rolling the game\u2019s initial credits - past which there are several completely different monsters introduced - feeling noticeably easier than previous entries in the series. To continue comparisons to World, it doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything as tough as Anjanath in the Ancient Forest or Diablos in the Wildspire Waste through the whole of Monster Hunter Rise\u2019s main story. This time around, the real big boys don\u2019t come out to play until very close to the end. While not boring by any means, it does make for a stronger difficulty spike instead of hitting more consistent walls. It\u2019s an interesting design choice that definitely settles you into the rhythm and familiarises you with the skill set of hunting more smoothly, but could feel like a grind for returning players looking to tax themselves from the off. However fans of Monster Hunter\u2019s more impenetrable systems needn\u2019t worry too much about any dumbing-down. Things like the inscrutable crafting system remain as bulletproof as ever - albeit with the ability to rollback unwanted upgrades to reclaim your spent materials. The wyverns in Monster Hunter Rise are brilliant. Each archetype feels so unique, so expressive and majestic that it feels utterly terrible to watch them gammily limp away in injured retreat or cry tears why you break one of their material parts.  There only feels like a couple of really obvious economic reuses of animations - a charge here, a paw-swipe there - but it does a lot to keep the same revisited areas fresh when you\u2019re fighting multiple different monsters in a single mission. The environments themselves look less brilliant, and this is one of the places that you can tell you\u2019re playing on a less powerful machine. Textures can look muddy and lack detail up close which is further lost at a distance.  \n \nHowever, docked and handheld performance has remained solid throughout the entirety of the main story and beyond I\u2019ve played. With that said, even on a stock Switch things in handheld mode look very, very small, and it\u2019s tough to discern the subtle animation cues of monsters\u2019 attack patterns and focus on the finer points that\u2019re key to success in Monster Hunter. A traditional console experience suits the marquee fights more naturally, but the option to take farming runs or other expeditions into handheld mode does help Rise feel less grindy. Finally, the biggest new addition in Monster Hunter Rise is Rampage mode, where you defend the gates of Kamura Village from waved onslaughts of multiple monsters at a time. It plays out like a tower defence game, where you position auto-firing ballista turrets and cannons, along with special units and bombs, to slow the encroaching advance of big beast after big beast.I really didn\u2019t like playing Rampage at first, where I felt like the protracted chunk of Monster Hunter animations meshed horribly with the frantic plate-spinning required to keep on top of the assault.  \n \nFor example, as I mentioned in the intro, getting poisoned by a Pukei-Pukei is an absolute disaster, since you have to spend an eternity putting away your weapon, cycling to an antidote, pressing to drink it, sniffing the cork of the bottle, writing flavor notes on the vintage, swirling it around in your palm to warm the aromas, before finally sitting down to drink it with a four-course meal. All the while your mates are getting battered by the kind of wyverns that target your installations, your defences are being mauled by the kind that monsters that break everything, and flying monsters just generally make a nuisance of themselves. Rampage has grown on me a lot as a good source of rewards and an alternative way to gather resources for many different types of monsters at once - especially as it\u2019s a much easier and ironically less intense way of farming difficult monster types. Then there are the unique Defender Ticket rewards, which give powerful \u2018Ramped Up\u2019 buffs to literally every weapon in the game, so it\u2019s well worth the distraction. Ultimately, Monster Hunter Rise is a solid, standalone entry to the series which pulls back on the scope of recent games on more powerful platforms, but doesn\u2019t skimp on the fundamentals that made the Monster Hunter name.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f086a93-6ed6-49da-998f-1424f197cd5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f086a93-6ed6-49da-998f-1424f197cd5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ef4a3adf-3be8-429f-9241-2c9645ec512d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6585855f0eaa540d46aade82120cc7fa736ec870ac75db56d732ffe2eaf248ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "bbfb5184-6239-4cd2-8dee-680d40bbe535", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fc52136a8b70784e4992b28f693117393d82e0a38fcf2f1fc293c96d9b919c5"}}, "hash": "67dfea297791331ad2bc1728c33be1173225c850bed363ff93fab5d509da1cd2", "text": "While it does feel like a smaller package in terms of grand story presentation, the new additions and quality-of-life fixes make it less grindy to play, with greater flexibility in exploration, navigation, and resource collection adding to the portable possibilities.
