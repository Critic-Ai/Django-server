Here\u2019s how it works.The wonderful chaos of the open world and your choice of how to tackle it is occasionally stifled by bad boss fights and worse boss speeches.PC Gamer's got your back \n\n\nOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.

An open world FPS where you liberate a rural region of Montana from a murderous cult\nExpect to pay: $60/\u00a350\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\nPublisher: Ubisoft\nReviewed On: Intel Core i5-6600K @ 3.50 GHz, 8 GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 980\nMultiplayer: Drop-in co-op with a friend, multiplayer maps for up to 12 players in Arcade mode\nLink: Official siteIn Hope County, Montana, you might find yourself using a guided missile to kill a charging bear. Not because a missile is the best weapon to kill a bear with\u2014a crossbow would be more sporting\u2014but simply because you already have the weapon resting on your shoulder. A moment ago you used it to blow an enemy plane out of the sky and a boat out of the water, so dispatching a bear with it is just quick and convenient, and the sooner the bear is dead, the sooner you can get back to the important task at hand: breaking the county record for catching the heaviest golden trout.Welcome to Far Cry 5, where a quiet spot of fishing can and often will result in piles of burnt wreckage and scattered corpses. It's a chaotic and wonderfully ridiculous open world sandbox of destruction and violence where a short drive down a dirt road can quickly become a pitched battle, as enemy vehicles appear and engage you, friendly fighters arrive and open fire at them, and ravenous animals leap from the woods and attack both. When the smoke finally clears, you may realize you've forgotten where you were going in the first place. Then an eagle swoops down and attacks your face.If you're a Far Cry veteran, this probably all sounds familiar, and Far Cry 5 follows the same blueprint as Far Cry 3 and 4 with a few new tweaks but no massive changes. I'm good with that: Ubisoft refining its wild and turbulent sandbox formula rather than reinventing it suits me just fine. This time you play as a nameless deputy sheriff sent to Hope County to arrest Joseph Seed, a cult leader backed by a heavily-armed force of devoted followers who have taken control of the region using kidnapping, mass murder, and brainwashing as recruitment tools. Your arrest of Seed in the first five minutes quickly goes awry, and your law enforcement cohorts are captured by the cult. Stranded in the mountainous backcountry with no backup, the only way out is to liberate the whole dang area, farm by farm.Hope County is divided into three regions, each controlled by a member of the Seed family. Defeating them requires first collecting resistance points in their regions, which come from completing missions, liberating captured locals, destroying the cult's resources, and conquering their outposts. Between these objectives you'll have countless random skirmishes, as traffic, enemies, rebels, citizens, and wildlife constantly converge and clash. It's a busy wilderness. You're constantly swiveling your head around to see where the gunfire is coming from or what people are yelling about, and amusingly, the NPCs react with the same panicked urgency when noticing an enemy plane circling as they do when spotting an approaching skunk.This chaos of overlapping AI factions is almost always a good thing\u2014the best parts of Far Cry are when crazy shit happens. It's just that crazy shit happens nearly constantly, which can occasionally be frustrating if you're hoping for a few minutes of silence to contemplate an environmental puzzle, admire the scenery, or catch a fish in peace.At one point I came across a quiet airfield with two planes parked on it, and thought I'd help myself to one. While preparing to attack the two cultists guarding it, I noticed some movement nearby: it was a bull fighting a mountain lion. As I engaged, one conflict spilled over into the other, and by the end of the fight more cultists had arrived (some in a helicopter), a wolverine had appeared and attacked a fleeing cow, a citizen had driven up in a tractor, two planes (in the air) got into a dogfight, another cultist drove up (in a different tractor), and the planes on the ground had exploded in the ensuing carnage. I had to settle for stealing one of the tractors, which I used to run over an angry bear that showed up late.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0bd2fcf-5891-41a4-9022-795236729076": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0bd2fcf-5891-41a4-9022-795236729076", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9e716e5-71d4-4d9e-814b-74e9e650ec6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "24287212d89e644e8a9f55275d91028bd5f35853145f5ccaa50fadc0e02a2489"}, "3": {"node_id": "085cdbcb-479b-402e-9cee-26a91f23c7e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38d7bfa9ff5bbc4131c24993029a85a99316ba7139b042d4e8df911db83958d3"}}, "hash": "4ec99078212ed2ba31bf14f00aed98c8ddccdf1ba99ce68032677fcf30233b3c", "text": "Slacker.I got a great performance using ultra settings (only motion blur was turned off) on my GeForce GTX 980 at 1920x1080: I was typically between 60-65 fps with occasional dips into the mid-50's. James played on his 1070 and found it ran buttery smooth as well.\u00a0Essentially, it's comparable to Far Cry 4, so if your PC ran that well you should see a similar performance from Far Cry 5. Read more in our comprehensive performance analysis.\u00a0To join this chaos you've got a constantly growing arsenal of weapons, including throwable shovels you can awesomely impale enemies with, craftable dynamite and proximity mines, and a generous cache of machine guns, rifles, pistols, and my favorite, the RAT4 rocket launcher, which locks onto vehicles and lets you steer your missile after firing (say, into a bear). There are lots of ways to get around: cars, boats, plus choppers and planes that are just as easy to operate as cars and boats. Cheap perks unlock a grappling hook for climbing, a wingsuit for when you can't be bothered to climb back down, and infinite parachutes, perfect for hastily activating when you realize the roof you just jumped off was a bit higher than you thought.Enemy outposts, as they were in earlier Far Cry games, are the best thing about Far Cry 5. Survey them from a distance, tag enemies with your scope or binoculars, and note other features like alarm towers (which can be used by the enemy to summon reinforcements), caged animals (which can be set free to cause a wonderful ruckus), and explosive barrels (self-explanatory), then either slither around dispensing cultists one by one with melee attacks and silenced weapons, or go in loud with grenades and guns. There's always satisfaction in being stealthy enough to take an outpost without a single shot being fired, but I prefer a big noisy fight filled with explosions and ragdolling enemies which runs the gamut from exhilarating to hilarious.You can also rip up the joint with missiles and miniguns while hovering overhead in a helicopter, which is a bit mindless but makes for a nice change of pace from all the careful scouting and enemy tagging. You can fling raw meat over the wall and let hungry wolves and cougars tear your enemies' throats out, or rig proximity mines all over the place, sneak away, and wait for patrolling guards to start stepping on them. The freedom you have to approach outposts in different ways extends to a lot of side missions as well.\u00a0You can fling raw meat over the wall and let hungry bears and cougars tear your enemies' throats out.The Far Cry series has often featured scalable towers that revealed new areas on your map, each with a slightly different configuration but still similar enough to result in what amounted to a repetitive chore of first-person climbing and jumping. While there are a few towers in Far Cry 5, they're only tied to side missions, you can just use a grappling hook to scale them, and they don't reveal map locations. Now you populate your map through exploration and getting tips from citizens, which is a great improvement. Filling in for those tower-climbing puzzles are 'prepper' stashes, caches of weapons, ammo, cash, and crafting resources, often in underground bunkers, sometimes booby trapped, flooded, locked, or with clues scattered around containing information on how to access them. Infiltrating these prepper stashes can be easy or hard, surprising or boring, annoying, spooky, deadly, or even require a bit of climbing\u2014you never really know what's in a bunker, hideout, or cave, and that's a lot better than climbing a set of slightly different towers.Far Cry 5 needed a better villain. The Seeds are boring bad guys, way too talkative without ever saying much, and each will kidnap you multiple times\u2014one can even drag you at will into extended hallucinations\u2014thus interrupting your open world fun to make you suffer through their monologues before either giving you a chance to escape or simply returning you to a friendly bunker. Killing them\u2014which sometimes involves a boss fight where the Seeds gain superhuman powers and take a ridiculous amount of damage before falling\u2014feels less like justice for the county and more like simple relief at not having to listen to their drawn-out speeches any longer.\u00a0\"Look at the headlines. Look who's in charge,\" one of the Seeds says, hoping to convince me that bringing about the end of the world is perfectly reasonable because the world is going to end soon anyway.

The headlines sure are scary these days.Apart from a few scattered lines of dialogue, there's no cohesive message or statement about politics or fascism or militias or anything, really, in Far Cry 5. The cult leaders themselves don't even mention God or religion as often you'd expect, and the cult's motivations are pretty vague beyond killing or drugging everyone who doesn't want to join. Far Cry 5 wants to be whimsical like GTA 5 (\"weaponized super-bears\" is spoken matter-of-factly), but its irreverence comes at the expense of developing interesting villains with clear motivations.I'm not surprised. Ubisoft didn't have a coherent or serious message about spying, surveillance, and privacy issues in Watch Dogs, either. I don't think any developer is obligated to include social commentary in their game, but to evoke so much of the visual language of religious fundamentalism and secessionism, and then not explore that stuff in any meaningful way, makes Far Cry 5 feel hollow. Seemingly scared of not pleasing everyone, Ubisoft avoided tackling deeper subjects altogether and decided that the villains were just weirdos.The dog can detect and tag enemies you can't see, the pilot can drop bombs and strafe targets from above, the bear is a bear.You're not alone in Far Cry 5 unless you want to be. There are generic NPC guns for hire you can bring along for support, and nine distinct AI companions you can recruit from side-missions scattered throughout the county. Three of the companions\u2014the best ones\u2014are animals (a dog, a bear, and a mountain lion), the rest are humans with backstories they won't stop blathering about even once you've heard every last anecdote and observation. You can bring one with you at a time (a perk can add room for another), and each has some useful skills depending on what sort of help you're looking for: the sniper can cover you while you fight at close range, the dog can detect and tag enemies you can't see, the pilot can drop bombs and strafe targets from above, the bear is a bear. \u00a0I didn't use companions that often\u2014the two-legged ones are just too blandly chatty for my tastes\u2014but I love romping around with a devoted bear at my side, and the biggest benefit of traveling with a buddy is that they can revive you if you've taken too much damage, saving you from death. Speaking of health, sadly absent in this Far Cry is the gruesome self-healing animation of past games, which I miss: watching yourself dig a bullet out of your flesh with a knife or resetting a broken bone with a crunch is more fun than simply winding some gauze around your arm. Alas.Far better than an AI buddy is a real one: you can play the entire game with a co-op partner, story missions and all. It's great fun to have a friend along for the ride in the chaotic sandbox of Far Cry 5, and taking down outposts with a coordinated co-op assault (or an uncoordinated one, for that matter) is even more enjoyable than doing it alone. It's easy to drop in and drop out no matter where you are in the game.A big, beautiful, chaotic canvas of freeform destruction, Far Cry 5 continues the series' best traditions. It's strongest when you get to decide how to tackle a challenge, and at its weakest when it strips you of your freedom and makes you listen to a super-powered boss slowly yammer about culling the weak or how pain will set you free. If you can stomach the occasional slow monologue from a dull zealot, you'll be back to blowing up bears in no time.The wonderful chaos of the open world and your choice of how to tackle it is occasionally stifled by bad boss fights and worse boss speeches.Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nEurogamer, Make Montana emergent again. You can kick off a spectacular set piece pretty much anywhere in Far Cry 5. All you need do is stand in the road. Give it 60 seconds, and - yes, there it is, a van full of hostages, cruising around unescorted, the lowest of low-hanging fruit. You pour hot lead into the windshield until the driver flops out of his seat like a spent shell casing, then follow the vehicle into a ditch and help its dazed occupants to safety. One grateful civilian waves you over, a side quest icon materialising over his head. \"Wh-\" he says, and is promptly swept off his feet by a speeding pick-up truck. The truck screeches to a halt and a huge, tattooed lady with a light machinegun climbs out, only to be set upon by the cougar you didn't notice lurking near the treeline. Your AI companion blasts the cougar with incendiary buckshot, setting it on fire; the cougar charges into your AI companion, setting him on fire; everybody runs in circles, yelling at each other, until a plane soars over a hillside and bombs the whole, silly escapade to ashy gristle. Moments of unrehearsed, systemic inanity like these have always been Far Cry's calling card as an open world shooter, and the fifth game continues that proud tradition: between the hostage trucks, convoys, roadblocks, sniper's nests, air patrols, wildlife, plentiful explosives and cartoon physics, you'll seldom want for distraction (or incineration) on the way to the next story objective. Sadly, the game which unfolds around these interludes isn't half as enjoyable. The first instalment to be set in North America, Far Cry 5 is Far Cry at its least engrossing, clumsiest and most basic, though there's still just enough going on here to keep a returning fan involved. Its attempts to address the fractious state of US society through the lens of a game that is essentially about dominating an Orientalised world are a predictable mixture of half-baked and callous. The mechanics of exploration, combat and conquest, meanwhile, lack charisma and substance for all the longer development time, with few new tools or challenges to speak of. Save for its campaign co-op, jaunty Arcade level editor and bland 6v6 multiplayer, it very much feels like the filler episode Far Cry: Primal was supposed to be.Far Cry 5 casts you as a rookie police deputy, travelling to the fictitious county of Hope, Montana to arrest one Joseph Seed, the McConaughey-esque leader of the Christian doomsday cult Eden's Gate. Seed's followers don't take kindly to their prophet's abduction, needless to say, and one hectic car chase  sequence later, you're at large in a county that has become a warzone, sealed off from the rest of the US. Your job is to take down Seed's three siblings, John, Jacob and Faith, each the boss of a particular region and section of the cult's operations, before launching an assault on the Father himself. You'll be aided in this endeavour by a homespun resistance, including nine unlockable AI companions with fully fleshed-out backstories and an endless supply of more generic accomplices who can be recruited on the fly. It's business as usual for Far Cry, give or take a few local variations. You undertake story and side missions to fill up a bar representing local resistance levels: reach certain milestones, and the cult will redouble its efforts to bring you down, dispatching tougher foes such as fighter planes to hound your steps.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36902fbb-29f7-4bae-8c3f-66d43c85e80c": {"__data__": {"id_": "36902fbb-29f7-4bae-8c3f-66d43c85e80c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f87c8ff-4317-4466-8adf-6a5a74fc3a87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d59eb74cb9584bd892646a1dfa4fc585aac2cb4f5da74b20ab08902c2a8d3792"}, "3": {"node_id": "731a03ce-dd6c-4e85-a706-79d2ec936d06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "182795d5833aa3b91f21b07779dfd0c8f3b98b1b7b47c4cd759f8253b70b23f5"}}, "hash": "0fe4aa5ded5709792e6ac631e0135630b80a66923d882873d9b6ffbb9e09d862", "text": "As you sink your teeth deeper into each region you'll also be sucked into the odd clash with one of the Seeds, who'll typically monologue a bit before somehow allowing you to slip their clutches. Fill the bar up completely and you'll trigger a final battle, followed by a race to the region's bunker to rescue all the locals the cult has abducted - a corridor gunfight with the odd, very lightweight puzzle element. As campaign frameworks go it just about keeps you awake, and Montana makes for an appealing backdrop, though it lacks the visual variety of Far Cry 4's Kyrat. But it's also very bland, and more importantly, a serious obstacle for the game's hapless stabs at social commentary. Far Cry 5's key problem as a story is that it's utterly at odds with itself. It wants to say something about our world, about evangelical ecstasy, gun advocacy and nihilism in America's heartlands, but all of that plays second fiddle to the real core of any Far Cry game, a colonialist fantasy that imposes its own criteria on the writing - casts split neatly between identikit footsoldiers and larger-than-life lieutenants, a struggle for survival that can only ever involve the gradual flipping of nodes on a map. It wants to dissect anxieties about nuclear war and the rise of \"patriot\" movements in the US, but it also wants to be an \"anecdote factory\", in creative director Dan Hay's words - a game that teaches its player to think of the setting as a cauldron of apolitical \"gameplay\" props, waiting to be jostled about until something explodes. It wants to analyse how cults rise and fall, drawing upon consultation with real-life cult deprogrammers, but in practice the Pledgekeepers of Eden's Gate are just another army of expendable, dehumanised grunts, irredeemable from the get-go. Presumably, many are relatives or old acquaintances of the various friendly Montana residents you'll encounter, but the writing waves this aside; as far as your red-blooded American allies are concerned, the only good \"Peggy\" is a dead Peggy, whoever they used to be. Where the game does try to take you through the mechanics by which people become fanatics, it does so at the level of cheap sensation, via devices such as mass hypnosis or mind-altering drugs that can be easily translated into the brutal lingo of an action game. There's little sustained investigation of wider social factors, like the overlap between militant Christian extremism and white supremacy or sexism - indeed, the game generally ducks such questions. The cult's ranks are stocked with a mixture of races and genders, in what feels like a careful sanitising of the subject matter. Adding insult to injury, the tone is all over the place, as though several writing teams were fighting for control of the pen. Torture scenes and talk of rape and infanticide sit alongside unspeakably lame wisecracks in weapon descriptions and spoofing of Donald Trump. One moment you're following a scarred huntress around while she weaves a story about cannibalism, the next you have to rescue a bear called Cheeseburger. It's possible to get away with these kinds of tonal shifts - see the Wolfenstein series under MachineGames - but you need a lot more flair than is on offer here.Where Far Cry 5's narrative is merely bad, the moment-to-moment of play is a cunning blend of competent and boring. Much of the action revolves around securing outposts, and these are structured exactly as in previous games - their compact layouts dotted with mounted turrets, vehicles you might turn into timebombs, cage locks you can shoot off to loose a wild animal amongst the guards and alarm systems you can disable to thwart the summoning of reinforcements. It certainly takes a bit of thought, and there are a few missions that change the tempo by, for example, forcing you to sneak for fear of a hostage being executed, but none of it is memorable. Far Cry's outpost design has been ripped off and bettered by any number of open worlders, within and without Ubisoft. Now would have been a good time to throw a few curves, and yet the game's assorted gas stations, ranches, airfields and hilltop bases are as unsurprising in structure as they are easy to upturn.The outposts might be more fun to roll over if your arsenal and customisation options weren't so deathly dull. There's no standout new weapon or gizmo, just the usual crop of SMGs, shotguns, rifles, pistols, launchers, flame throwers, light machine guns and bows, all very lightly accessorisable with scopes and expanded magazines.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "731a03ce-dd6c-4e85-a706-79d2ec936d06": {"__data__": {"id_": "731a03ce-dd6c-4e85-a706-79d2ec936d06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "36902fbb-29f7-4bae-8c3f-66d43c85e80c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0fe4aa5ded5709792e6ac631e0135630b80a66923d882873d9b6ffbb9e09d862"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e2b0b0c-18db-489e-91e9-214bebe09bb4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6787a32e2ff05ba5382de2238d0b2a6f5209e75a14b9f11c061c30e5bf26daad"}}, "hash": "182795d5833aa3b91f21b07779dfd0c8f3b98b1b7b47c4cd759f8253b70b23f5", "text": "The kinesis of Far Cry combat is as mouth-watering as ever - no other shooter save Battlefield quite grasps the joy of lobbing a perfectly timed grenade beneath the wheels of a speeding car - but the lack of inventiveness is startling. The perks system is just as insipid: it consists largely of passive upgrades like inventory expansions and faster reloads per weapon category, plus familiar active abilities like the repair torch and wingsuit. The practice of chaining melee executions - one of Far Cry 3's most vicious flourishes - returns but has been strangely de-emphasised, bundled up into a single unlock. It's one of several, promising systems the new game might have elaborated upon; instead, Ubisoft has stripped it back.In some respects, Far Cry 5's heart of hearts doesn't lie anywhere in Hope, Montana. It lies in Far Cry Arcade, a map editor where the fundamentally reductive nature of Far Cry's open world is caught in the neon glare of a faux coin-op interface. Here, you're free to bodge together and share your own PvE or deathmatch levels within a generous memory budget, using assets lifted from previous Far Cry games, Watch Dogs 2 and Assassin's Creed: Unity. There are some entertaining concoctions on the servers already, which you can sample at random as part of a 6-12 player group or tackle all by yourself - a barebones yet surprisingly moreish shooting range in which all players wield AK47s, and a crackpot neon labyrinth of water traps and jump ramps that could almost be a nod to Action Half-Life.The real intrigue of the Arcade mode, however, is that it exposes how Ubisoft's open world games have become slaves to a formula. In letting you mingle pieces from several franchises - the skyscrapers of San Francisco towering over the ruins of a daydream Tibet, the cannons of revolutionary France lifting rusted muzzles amid the splintered daylight of backwoods America - the editor reveals their basic interchangeability, the way all of these series default to the same broad framework of killing, conquering and unlocking. This is the apparently inescapable truth of Far Cry, a series that still has a lot going for it, but remains in serious need of a revamp. It is a moribund apparatus of conquest that is unable to tell any story other than the rise to power of a well-armed outsider over a lushly imagined, exoticised realm, however urgently it might try. \n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nEdwin Evans-Thirlwell\n\n          Contributor\n        Edwin is a writer from London hailed by peers as \"terminally middle-class\" and \"experienced\".

Far Cry 5 is built on this sort of problem solving. Brilliant, terrible, \u2018what was I thinking?!\u2019 or \u2018how did this happen\u2019 disaster management where the solution is usually shooting, explosions and often a great deal of regret - part slapstick, part exercising the right to bear arms, and part actual bears. Why did I throw a petrol bomb inside the house? What was I expecting the truck coming at me to do when I shot the driver\u2019s face off? I\u2019ve made 20 murderous cultists very, very angry, AMA.\u00a0The initial impression is that this is more of the same - liberating bases in an open world crammed with chaos and random animal attacks. That\u2019s by no means a bad thing. This is full of spur of the moment combat as you adapt and invent tactics on the fly; always rewarding and fun, with a chaotic push and pull that can kill hours and finish up with you realising you never even got near the thing you originally set out to do. It will eat your weekends and snack on the evenings.11 things to know before you play Far Cry 5But take a step back and it\u2019s obvious that while the core \u2018oh God I\u2019m on fire and everyone\u2019s shooting at me\u2019 gameplay is familiar, there are lots of clever tweaks. Everything's been tightened up, refreshing the mix and creating a more streamlined pace. For example, towers are gone - there are no maps spammed with markers after climbing one.

It creates a more unpredictable and organic feel to progress. Rather than unlocking 30 objectives at once and chin-stroking on what to do next, you\u2019re out exploring and seeing what you can find.\u00a0Missions and information feel more meaningful when you have to earn them and it doesn\u2019t take long before you've plenty of things to choose from.\u00a0It all helps build on the idea that you're just the little guy in someone else's world. You're the flea on the dog's back, not the dog. Even key story missions are out of your control - triggered by progress, meetings with bad guy leaders become unpredictable interjections as you're snatched when they feel like it, not when you decide to see them.\u00a0The world is smaller too, but denser in return. So while the map is much reduced - only three regions to Far Cry 4\u2019s six - you never feel short changed. There\u2019s always\u2026 a thing, somewhere, waiting to happen to you. It usually involves screaming and not always yours. So it\u2019s leaner, but what\u2019s been removed is the stuff in between the action, not the action itself. In Far Cry 5 crafting is all but gone for example, reduced to making explosives and buff potions in the weapon wheel. All those ammo capacity increases, and things you\u2019d previously spend hours chasing animals for, are moved into the game\u2019s perk system.\u00a0It cuts away the fat of previous games, just leaving the meat of what makes the series good. Some things don\u2019t change. You\u2019re still exploring a troubled place - a fictional American midwestern rural community under the thumb of a doomsday cult called Eden\u2019s Gate - and working with the locals to fight back and build a resistance in Far Cry 5. You\u2019re liberating bases, balancing speedy, sprinting stealth with the almost inevitable messy, loud conclusion once you trigger an alarm. There are people to rescue, side missions to nibble, events and set pieces aplenty to keep you busy.\u00a0Prepper stashes are a particular joy among all this. Building on the Doomsday prepper themes there are supply rooms hidden around the world full of weapons, gear, perk points and more. You never quite know what you\u2019ll get - both in terms of reward or challenge. Some are climbing puzzles, some are underwater, one is in a tower full of wasp nests you have to try and avoid disturbing. There are story-focused ones and plenty more I won\u2019t spoil (including one of the best bits of the whole game). They\u2019re always unpredictable, interesting, and a great way to break up the action.\u00a0Whatever you do in all this, the idea of being part of a team is stronger now with Far Cry's GUNs for hire, and FANGs can pick up. There are six people and three animals you can choose from to fight alongside you (one at a time initially) using a range of tools to vary your options and capabilities. Nick Rye has a strafing, bomb dropping plane, for example, while Grace Armstrong brings long range sniper support. Other characters have flamethrowers, helicopters and there are generic \u2018fighters\u2019 - basically no name soldiers you can hire in a pinch. Pet-wise you could choose Cheeseburger the bear for tanking savagery, Boomer the dog for highlighting enemies, and Peaches the cougar for silent kills on command.You\u2019ll have your favorites, but once you start switching them out for different missions the game opens up immensely. Especially when you unlock a 'Leadership' perk that lets you have two companions at once. At that point Far Cry 5 becomes a different game as you move from lone gun to leader of a (small) army. Not bothered about stealth and just need to blow shit up? Call in Adelaide's chaingun-armed chopper and Hurk with his rocket launcher. Need to save hostages without setting off alarms? Get Jess in with her bow and Peaches to despatch bad guys without a whisper. The commands are simple - go there, kill this - but when you coordinate an attack and pull if off, it feels amazing.\u00a0Perhaps the only thing I didn't really click with was a maybe an over reliance on hostage rescue to balance the otherwise repercussion free carnage, and some largely flat villains. \u00a0I just didn\u2019t feel much for the cult leaders - the defeat of which the entire game hinges on. In a series that\u2019s seen star turns from Vaas and Pagan Min, Joseph Seed and his clan don\u2019t quite have the same pop.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "320c305f-c00a-46b0-8ba5-5ecc8b54d1d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "320c305f-c00a-46b0-8ba5-5ecc8b54d1d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "733958f0-d682-4aac-86b1-2422705924ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c6936119afb28a9482396f6f796f1dcd8996ab07a8edebd48862f8cf9d0c352"}, "3": {"node_id": "289a49da-9c02-4a14-bc0b-9712c84c2bba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b91b6e45de470c5c0a23789d4e2d4a80447016db448f3eff8792688661eaab01"}}, "hash": "ba4271cabc471fb580fec0945d0ceacaa5d0d1f7b9636743db90b715dedb6181", "text": "Which is odd when the world and everything in it is full of character, and the tone is often darker and more sinister than before (the opening is an amazingly tense sequence). There are serious horror/crime thriller vibes in places, with environmental and incidental storytelling creating a grimer and less fanciful take on the usual Far Cry narrative.\u00a0The familiar US setting, and the fact that real life events like Jonestown and Wako actually happened, make this feel more plausible in some ways than distant Tibetan despots and feudal tropical islands. However, the subdued portrayal of its cult leader, and sub-bosses, lacks impact. They should project menace that makes your skin prickle, and they don\u2019t. out of Jospeh, Jacob, John and Faith, only ex-soldier Jacob has any really edge or depth to his presence. Tonally it feels pulled in different directions between the primary colour comedy of characters like Hurk or Adelaide (frat boy ass humour and \u2018older women talking about sex is funny\u2019 respectively) and its attempt to create a more subtle evil from a cult leader that could actually exist. It almost feels transitional, taking a half step towards being more serious but not fully committing.\u00a0The tonal inconsistencies are more a case of not quite hitting the mark rather than missing the target completely, though. The overall thrust is still an entertaining cacophony of animal attacks, accidental fires, plan Bs, and bad guys to beat. There\u2019s loads to enjoy and design tweaks tighten everything up. Just the single player element is enough to make this worth playing but then there\u2019s the fact you can tackle the entire campaign in co-op, adding a brilliant layer of two player calamity, and the Arcade map creator. I\u2019ve only dabbled briefly but built a simple assassination mission in a mountain lodge, and checked how many turkeys it takes to kill a bear (12, if you\u2019re interested). It\u2019s an accessible dev-level creation system full of props, terrain editors, enemies, AI and gameplay modifiers. Whether you want to cobble together a few things and see what happens, or start your development career, it\u2019s got you covered. It\u2019ll also provide plenty of new single player, co-op and multiplayer levels to take on after the stories done.\u00a0Far Cry 5 is a continuation of everything you remember about the series, but an instalment that\u2019s taken a good look at itself, and what it does, to work out the best possible way of doing it. The compact, more streamlined design never feels small and instead comes across as more achievable and event filled. How often have you finished a Far Cry with a ton of missions and bits you never got around to doing? That\u2019s that stuff that\u2019s been paired back. What remains are the best bits - the pure, distilled chaos of the series more manageably portioned and packaged.I'm GamesRadar's Senior Guides Co-ordinator, which means I run GamesRadar's guides and tips content.

Since then the exact same formula has been used in four different games: spin-off Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4, Far Cry Primal, and now this new numbered sequel. None of the games have any narrative connection but they all feature a giant open world wilderness, a charismatic bad guy, and an invading army that needs to be rooted out by destroying their outputs and liberating sections of the map bit by bit.Far Cry 5 throws out a few of the series\u2019 more overfamiliar elements (there\u2019s a joke about climbing a radio tower at the beginning that the developer no doubt thought was hilarious) but in most respects it follows the formula very precisely. But while that sounds like it would be a criticism it\u2019s really not. The Far Cry games have always been one of the most entertaining open world shooters around and this is probably the best one yet. Even if it is a bit sad that you have to prove the main villain wrong: every problem can be solved with a bullet. At least in this video game.The set-up is exactly the same as Far Cry 3, in that a paramilitary organisation, in this case a vaguely anti-globalist doomsday cult, has taken over and at the beginning of the game has almost complete control of a whole county in Montana. This is clearly absurd, especially as the only official response is to send in four people (one of whom is your own mute, customisable character) to arrest the cult leader Joseph Seed. Seed is relatively menacing but he\u2019s barely in it for most of the game and it\u2019s his three siblings you deal with most of the time, via some very dull cut scenes \u2013 the majority of which involve you being captured and then miraculously escaping.Each sibling controls a third of the world map and one of Far Cry 5\u2019s key improvements on previous games is how much freedom you have to pick fights where you want. There\u2019s almost no structure to the story missions and you can tackle them simply by turning up to a hotspot and working out what needs to be done. If it\u2019s liberating an enemy outpost then it works in the same way as ever: you can go in all guns blazing or take a stealthier approach and knock out its alarms first, so reinforcements cannot be called.Outposts make up a relatively small percentage of the total missions though and the game\u2019s great virtue is just how varied and interesting the other ones are. There\u2019s a lot of relatively straightforward sieges, vehicle battles (including helicopters and planes), and hostage rescues, but also more puzzle-orientated sections \u2013 where you\u2019re trying to work out how to get into a stash of equipment \u2013 and various excuses to hunt the local wildlife. But it\u2019s the side missions that really impress and they can range from climbing a mountain peak to helping a film director finish his movie, swimming around a water treatment park, and investigating rumours of alien landings.Which you missions you do and when is almost entirely up to you, with the only definite goal being to accrue enough \u2018resistance points\u2019 to destabilise an area. And this all works excellently well. The gunplay is solid enough to make up for the fact that most things boil down to a firefight in the end, and there\u2019s a wide range of perks to unlock which do everything from give you the ability to booby trap cars to take along up to two \u2018guns for hire\u2019 with you.The perks are unlocked by completing in-game achievements, such as getting kills with each different weapon and character, and work well to encourage you to use the full variety of your inventory \u2013 which includes various forms of explosives, throwing knifes, and homeopathic power-up potions (why they picked on homeopathic medicine we don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s another example of the game\u2019s so-subtle-you\u2019re-not-sure-it\u2019s-actually-intended satire).The guns for hire are the other big new feature, and while you can recruit ordinary people to help you out, each with their own simple specialities, there\u2019s nine story characters that have more unique abilities \u2013 such as the guy with a plane in our opening paragraph.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ecf19a1-8ff1-4f18-8f64-bddee6db62f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ecf19a1-8ff1-4f18-8f64-bddee6db62f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "289a49da-9c02-4a14-bc0b-9712c84c2bba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b91b6e45de470c5c0a23789d4e2d4a80447016db448f3eff8792688661eaab01"}, "3": {"node_id": "5ff4ee81-2cc8-4ff5-b154-ee5877b44f0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "919cf6c0e2573da96339e97135466b0a48d889612f5abafec7c6165c0f5a9670"}}, "hash": "f0101db556d685a355c5c8d1685fb8d54a953ae0f3010bd97165607c27cf8120", "text": "Three of them are animals though, and having a cougar and a grizzly bear running around murderising bad guys for you is hard to get tired of.A gun for hire can also be a human player, if you want to bring someone in for co-op.

Characters, both allies and enemies, are always wandering off and crashing vehicles, while even proper story allies have a painfully short number of phrases they constantly repeat.For a Ubisoft Montreal game Far Cry 5 is otherwise not too glitchy, although we did have a few missions were an in-game event wouldn\u2019t trigger properly and we had to start again. And while it\u2019s not a bug there is an issue where the default weapons the enemies have are really all you need for the majority of the game, which undercuts the desire to unlock and customise other ones. Especially given the game is extremely easy and a lot of it can be beaten almost on autopilot, literally when you have guns for hire in tow.The only other issue is the weird tonal shifts, which have always been an issue with the series. The Far Cry games always feel like they should be funnier and more outlandish than they are, and this one in particular is held back by trying to make some serious points but being too afraid to upset Americans by saying anything interesting about gun control or religion. It beats about the bush so timidly you\u2019re often not sure whether it\u2019s even really trying or if you\u2019re just reading more into it than was intended. Although we chose to take the fact that most of the good guys are unlikeable, survivalist gun nuts as an intentional satire.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023There are more obvious jokes in the game, but because of the inconsistent tone they always fall flat. So it\u2019s no wonder the developer has reserved the DLC for less serious fair, such as missions on Mars and in Vietnam. In the meantime though you can make use of Far Cry Arcade, which allows you to design your own maps \u2013 including using in-game assets from other Ubisoft games \u2013 and create your own mini-game. The editor seems quite powerful and it\u2019s interesting that so far a lot of the uploaded examples try to turn the game into more of a survival horror.Narrative missteps and some technical issues don\u2019t stop Far Cry 5 from being thoroughly entertaining throughout, and it has much to teach other games about varied side missions and open-ended gameplay. It\u2019s a far cry from having any coherent political message but as a video game this is one of the best open world adventures around and shows how large-scale innovation isn\u2019t necessary if the smaller details are interesting and new.In Short: The best Far Cry yet and one of the best open world shooters of any kind, with an impressive variety of missions and non-linear structure.Pros: Large open world is used to the fullest, with a huge range of interesting and varied missions. Solid gunplay and welcome co-op options. Perk system and vehicles work well.Cons: Almost pointlessly easy at times and artificial intelligence can be laughably bad. Some noticeable bugs and overpowered starter weapons. Timid storytelling when it comes to real-world issues.Score: 8/10\nFormats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, and PC\nPrice: \u00a354.99\nPublisher: Ubisoft\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Montreal\nRelease Date: 27th March 2018\nAge Rating: 18Email gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on TwitterSign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGame Informer, After targeting tin-pot dictators and megalomaniacs across the globe, Far Cry 5 sets its sights closer to home. This entry moves the open-world mayhem to Hope County, Montana \u2013 a beautiful base of operations for outdoorspeople, rugged individualists, and a murderous death cult. It\u2019s also a playground for the explosive antics that we\u2019ve come to expect from the series, where you and a friend can seamlessly go from taking down an armed convoy to bow hunting to fly fishing \u2013 or flying a plane \u2013 depending on what sounds fun.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ff4ee81-2cc8-4ff5-b154-ee5877b44f0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ff4ee81-2cc8-4ff5-b154-ee5877b44f0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ecf19a1-8ff1-4f18-8f64-bddee6db62f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0101db556d685a355c5c8d1685fb8d54a953ae0f3010bd97165607c27cf8120"}, "3": {"node_id": "75444160-a13e-4fcb-86bb-60739197419c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "88c78c7209e15547a743ef02146d1aec6b637e59597cda84dee57ad8a7476881"}}, "hash": "919cf6c0e2573da96339e97135466b0a48d889612f5abafec7c6165c0f5a9670", "text": "Once the luster of the new setting and co-op companionship wears thin, however, you\u2019re left with an experience that\u2019s familiar to a fault.Hope County has been overrun by Joseph Seed, leader of an apocalyptic cult called Project at Eden\u2019s Gate. A disastrous raid on Joseph\u2019s compound leaves your created character, a rookie sheriff\u2019s deputy, alone and outnumbered in a hostile environment. The setup is interesting, but soon settles into a standard routine. Your job is to clear out the Peggies (the local slur for the cultists) by any means necessary \u2013 most of which boils down to reclaiming outposts and taking on missions for the locals. Joseph has a lot of land to cover, and he\u2019s a master at delegating. His church heralds include the charismatic John Seed; hunter of man Jacob Seed; and psy-ops hippie Faith Seed. These three walking archetypes have little consistency between them apart from their last names.Far Cry 5 isn\u2019t as provocative as its posturing may lead you to believe. Its exploration of religious extremism is too bizarre to be taken seriously, and it\u2019s delivered with a self-serious tone that it doesn\u2019t earn. You get knocked out, abducted, and tied to a chair a ridiculous number of times. Since your character is mute and can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) engage in conversation, you end up with extended scenes where vamping bad guys talk at your immobilized form and over-explain their half-baked philosophies. Some moments attempt to subvert your expectations, but they\u2019re generally limp commentaries along the lines of saying, \u201cAh, yes, but have you considered that YOU are the real villain here?\u201dThe story doesn\u2019t offer many big surprises or payoffs, and the same can be said for the gameplay. It\u2019s competent on most fronts, providing a massive world to explore and an arsenal of destructive tools, but it doesn\u2019t feel fresh. Taking down outposts doesn\u2019t provide any new thrills or challenges, and new items like proximity bombs don\u2019t open up encounters. Past games introduced strategy and light puzzle elements as you were rewarded for staking out these camps and figuring out how to take advantage of their weak spots. The Peggies seem more interested in maintaining their human flock than setting up decent defenses. They all follow the same basic setup: A couple of guys are on roofs, one or two have set up shop by the alarms, and a handful of bearded weirdos linger near the explosive barrels. You\u2019re certainly welcome to scout the bases and direct your A.I. companions to help you remain undetected, but going in with guns blazing is just as effective and definitely more efficient. You may miss out on a few cash bonuses, but I was generally flush throughout the game and at no point felt like I was missing out. Vignettes showing former residents reclaiming each outpost are satisfying, but getting to those points isn\u2019t particularly gratifying.Ubisoft Montreal does break from past games in a couple of major ways. First, your deputy doesn\u2019t reveal the world around them by climbing towers to get a better view. Instead, you remove the fog on your map by doing missions and finding maps scattered in ranger stations and other structures. Environmental puzzles are still here in the form of lucrative prepper caches, which are one of my favorite parts of Far Cry 5. Each one offers a unique challenge, which can include escaping a trapped bunker or navigating a mountain obstacle course, with big rewards at the end of each one. I got excited every time an NPC conversation put a new cache icon on my map.\u00a0The second major break from tradition is a decreased focus on hunting; animal pelts are only redeemable for cash, and are no longer associated with crafting. I enjoyed the survival aspect from past games, as silly as it was, and it felt strange to see a previously important part of the series fall to the side like that. Instead of using skins to build holsters and ammo pouches, now you invest points in upgrades as you see fit. The game is generous with the points, which you earn through mission progression and challenges, and it\u2019s easy to prioritize abilities to how you like to play. For instance, if you prefer diving into fast-travel locations from the air instead of spawning on the ground, you can choose to do that. Or you can prioritize potions, making it easier to find the required components and reduce their cost. You will be able to pick up most, if not all, of these perks along the way, so it doesn\u2019t matter too much in the long run.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75444160-a13e-4fcb-86bb-60739197419c": {"__data__": {"id_": "75444160-a13e-4fcb-86bb-60739197419c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ff4ee81-2cc8-4ff5-b154-ee5877b44f0c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "919cf6c0e2573da96339e97135466b0a48d889612f5abafec7c6165c0f5a9670"}, "3": {"node_id": "41cbebc7-a567-41eb-8a05-23b20ce9b261", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad319d159118a17900a0eb57b743277d3ccc4f5d1724f965d03b7edccf36ae58"}}, "hash": "88c78c7209e15547a743ef02146d1aec6b637e59597cda84dee57ad8a7476881", "text": "Dismantling Jacob Seed\u2019s operations could be downright tedious if not for one of the game\u2019s most fleshed-out systems. The Guns for Hire, A.I. companions that you recruit to fight alongside you, add some much-needed variety to the game. There are nine of them to find in the world, and you have to complete a special mission to convince them to tag along. It\u2019s generally worth it. You can bring two of them on your adventures in the solo game, and finding effective combos is part of the fun. Feel like being stealthy? Bring Grace, a sniper, and a tamed cougar named Peaches. Would you rather go a little crazy? Put Hurk (and his RPG) in your crew. Each companion brings something special to the table, too, such as dog Boomer\u2019s ability to automatically mark targets for you. It makes playing solo feel less lonely, and I got a kick out of experimenting with different pairings. The best pairing is with another player, however, and that\u2019s where the game shines.\u00a0For the first time in the Far Cry series, you can play through the entire campaign in co-op. Having a second player around makes the game significantly more entertaining (even if the difficulty balance seems tailored for one), and exploring the playground together is a blast. I had a great time tormenting my partner, whether I was luring him under beehives, blowing up dynamite inside our plane, or rigging his car with explosives. Players are tethered together, so you can\u2019t freely roam around the entire world independently, but it\u2019s a generously long leash. It was never an issue during my time with the game, aside from a few times when I hopped in a plane and took off before my partner could join me in the cockpit. The scripted tasks can feel like chore lists, but players who enjoy messing around with systems can find plenty to love. It\u2019s worth noting that you\u2019ll need to find a charitable partner, since only the host\u2019s mission and world progress is saved. Your buddy will keep their character progression and inventory, but they\u2019ll have to repeat everything else on their own game.\u00a0The experience isn\u2019t necessarily about beelining through the critical path, however. If you don\u2019t take the time to talk to NPCs, you miss out on a wealth of side missions, which are generally more interesting than being talked at for the Nth time by one of the Seeds. Still, Far Cry 5 doesn\u2019t deliver on exploring the lives of people who live in this Red-Dawn-meets-David-Koresh nightmare. You can read notes that outline some of the challenges the characters have faced, but the tragedy isn\u2019t typically explored through gameplay. Instead, you\u2019re asked to chase down baseball cards for a former player who is sad, or harvest bull testicles for a picnic. Those moments of levity are especially jarring when you routinely drive past corpses that have been hung from bridges or strung up in grotesque effigies. \u201cI guess I can help you catch that lunker, ma\u2019am, but have you noticed that your neighbors have been crucified?\u201dPublic executions aside, Far Cry 5\u2019s world is meticulously constructed, and it\u2019s a remarkable facsimile of Big Sky Country. Unfortunately, too much of the action in it is uninspired. It\u2019s a beautiful but bland recitation of what\u2019s come before, from both the series and Ubisoft\u2019s open-world playbook. It\u2019s never bad, but considering how great the past games have been, its overall predictability is disappointing.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

You'll engage in different styles of offensive conflict; attempt to tame the wild, natural environment to your advantage; and slowly build a guerilla resistance in the background. But for its fifth mainline entry, the series formula has undergone some very positive refinements, which make its core hook of exploring and engaging with its volatile setting a more free-flowing and pleasant experience.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41cbebc7-a567-41eb-8a05-23b20ce9b261": {"__data__": {"id_": "41cbebc7-a567-41eb-8a05-23b20ce9b261", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "75444160-a13e-4fcb-86bb-60739197419c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "88c78c7209e15547a743ef02146d1aec6b637e59597cda84dee57ad8a7476881"}, "3": {"node_id": "501a0c9d-7cb3-4e3e-9d54-bbc34f5c5df5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "129c42a541adb70b7c84e5e108ad26ca5d132579e7811a4450c6b099261f8e97"}}, "hash": "ad319d159118a17900a0eb57b743277d3ccc4f5d1724f965d03b7edccf36ae58", "text": "It lets you fully enjoy the sights and activities of its beautiful and interesting open-world without too many overt distractions.The biggest change is that the series is finally confident enough to put you in charge of your own progression. After a brief orientation, the entire region of Hope County, Montana USA is immediately open for exploration. Three intimidatingly large regions surround your starting point, and you're given only a gentle suggestion of a good first destination. The moment when you're shown all the equally accessible possibilities and the furthest reaches of the map feels liberating--you may even be crippled by the choice, and that's a good problem to have.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Far Cry 5 ReviewTo accompany this decision, Far Cry 5 now handles its story progression in a more freeform manner. The goal in each of the three regions is to earn enough Resistance Points to hit three milestones, and subsequently have three encounters with three lieutenants of the Eden's Gate cult, with the ultimate goal of reaching their leader, Joseph Seed, \"The Father\". Each of these individuals runs a different facet of the God-fearing group, but their role in the story ultimately isn't as interesting as you might think, despite Far Cry 5's potential for a controversial and politically charged narrative. Earning Resistance Points--an abstract indication of the growing opposition to Eden's Gate--can be achieved in a number of different ways. Completing story missions and side missions for resistance members is the most efficient way to do so, but you can also viably achieve your goal by performing smaller tasks that you might stumble across during your journeys through the county: rescuing civilians in random encounters, finding and destroying cult structures or supply vehicles, and liberating occupied compounds, seized as cult outposts.Mechanically, it's a great, player-friendly system that rewards you no matter what activities you decide to undertake or avoid. But the reason why it feels so good in execution is due to a change regarding how you discover these opportunities in the first place. With the exception of the locations of each region's hub area and the whereabouts of Specialists (support characters who provide unique abilities), no points of interest are marked on your world map, and the traditional Far Cry (and Ubisoft game) practice of finding and scaling key structures to populate the world with icons has been removed.Discovering points of interest can be achieved in a few ways. Physically stumbling upon a significant area will mark it on your map. Actively looking at wildlife road signs inform you of the fauna in that region. Finding notes, maps, and magazines located in homes and other buildings can point you to a number of different things, including Prepper Stashes, which involve solving obscure environmental puzzles that can lead to money and gear. Simply encountering a civilian might give you the opportunity to talk to them about the latest word on the grapevine about an outpost, side quest, or even the location of a story quest giver.All these elements work wonderfully together to create a style of larger progression that feels mostly organic. I began my time with the game knowing I would be pursuing stealth tactics, so I immediately set off toward the given location of a Specialist who would complement that playstyle. Along the way, I encountered a civilian being led down the road at gunpoint. After saving him, he told me about a nearby pumpkin farm which had been seized by Eden's Gate. As a vegetable lover, I made it my personal duty to free the oppressed squashes from their gun-toting captors. I happened to find a map marking fishing spots while I was sneaking around the compound, and once I had liberated the farm, one of the farmers I had freed flagged me down to offer a side mission. While the initial expanse of the open world might cripple you with choice, the discovery system dishes out distinct options in small doses, encouraging you to follow and explore the small distractions you might find with genuine curiosity, as opposed to because it was one of a dozen icons you arbitrarily picked as they stared at you from a minimap.In fact, there is no minimap, and it's one of the best things to happen to the series (as was also the case in Far Cry 2). There's a compass that helps you track your direction and will narrow down the general location of enemies and marked objectives, but there's nothing telling you about the specifics of the area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "501a0c9d-7cb3-4e3e-9d54-bbc34f5c5df5": {"__data__": {"id_": "501a0c9d-7cb3-4e3e-9d54-bbc34f5c5df5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "41cbebc7-a567-41eb-8a05-23b20ce9b261", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad319d159118a17900a0eb57b743277d3ccc4f5d1724f965d03b7edccf36ae58"}, "3": {"node_id": "05f621d0-bc0e-46c2-87f2-c4851b1e78bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c61f3391cd020a262c8605fa8822fcde6a8be2a1afdcd1f8faecc39a080a7956"}}, "hash": "129c42a541adb70b7c84e5e108ad26ca5d132579e7811a4450c6b099261f8e97", "text": "You'll still need to navigate to the menu to see the world map (the in-world physical map from Far Cry 2 was sadly not reimplemented), but it's a welcome change nonetheless. The absence of the minimap allows you to see the trees in the forest, so to speak. You can focus on details in the world without distraction, and can actively appreciate the stunning beauty of the natural environment you inhabit--the tall Douglas firs among the craggy hills, the serene fields and farms, the lively rivers teeming with fish--and pay full attention to intricate interior details in the homes and businesses you visit, each with distinct, lived-in personality.The new freeform flow sits comfortably well with the most celebrated aspect of the Far Cry series: the capacity for you to engage with the game's conflicts in your own way, seeing what kinds of chance scenarios you stumble into, and attaining those watercooler tales about what happened next. There are still numerous ways to approach tasks like liberating outposts--go in sight unseen with stealthy movement and silent weapons, lure predatory animals into the compound to do the dirty work for you, take advantage of the propagating fire system and set the place alight with flamethrowers and explosives, or just be traditional and go in guns blazing.Far Cry 5's altered upgrade system helps you make these modes of play more viable from the get-go. Perks are grouped into disciplines but aren't arranged in any kind of tree, meaning prerequisites aren't necessarily needed to unlock particular skills, and almost nothing is progress-locked. So if you begin the game and prefer stealthy approaches, you can unlock perks that let you run silently, move faster while crouched, and perform multiple takedowns (all previously higher-level skills, typically) as your very first unlocks. Points to spend on perks are tied to an item you'll likely find often during your regular travels in the world, as well as a laundry list of very achievable challenges that correlate to every weapon, personal action, and support character in the game. You can go out of your way to vary your approaches and maximise perk points, but if you tend to stick to a specific kind of playstyle, it's unlikely that you'll need to. There's also, thankfully, less of an emphasis on hunting. Selling animal skins is the most lucrative way to earn money for purchasing weapons and vehicles, but the series is finally past the point of needing to hunt specific creatures for the purposes of crafting upgrades.Another fantastic change (again revived from Far Cry 2) involves the aforementioned Specialists and their more generic relative, the Guns for Hire. They allow you to utilise and command the unique skills of one of many support buddies, adding another fun and dynamic element to your toolkit. Specialists provide a variety of options, from the humans that lay down covering fire with different weapons and vehicles to the animals who can assist you in marking enemies and stealth takedowns. They're fantastic assets who can complement your skillset or fill in a necessary gap. You might recruit tortured archer Jess to give you a silent attack option, or order helicopter pilot Adelaide to fly in and provide suppressing fire and a distraction.The AI that drives support characters sometimes makes poor decisions that puts them in harm's way, but in lieu of a co-op partner, Specialists help bolster the series propensity for emergent, fist-pumping \"hell yeah\" moments. You could be crossing a bridge and find that an enemy SUV has surprised you by driving up onto it from behind, completely blocking your escape. You could dart into the forest ahead for cover and inadvertently disturb a cougar, who starts by chasing you, but turns and decides one of your aggressors is an easier catch. You might then find yourself in a high-speed car chase, and call Specialist Nick to fly in with his armed seaplane to attack the pursuing vehicles. And as you hear him hooting and hollering over the radio, you look out the rear window to see his airstrike completely annihilate the convoy in a fiery explosion, right before you turn back around and find yourself driving off a cliff.That's what Far Cry 5 is all about--fluid and dynamic engagements that act as different canvases and let you use the game's variety of tools to finish the picture. At least, that's the case most of the time.

You'll escape each time, of course, and in doing so, typically plow through single-style corridor affairs until you escape or reach an opportunity to kill the lieutenant. These missions showcase some of the game's most stunning setpieces, but mechanically they're bland at best, featuring elementary stealth challenges, on-rails turret sequences, and monotonous platforming among other scenarios. These missions are relatively brief, but they're semi-regular occurrences that pull you away from the world that makes Far Cry 5 great, and it's easy to hold that against them.What makes these missions more egregious are the prolonged, close-up encounters with the Seed family members upon capture. Joseph Seed and his lieutenants are nothing if not charismatic villains, and their performances are impressive. But every encounter with them is the same--you're restrained in some manner and can do nothing but watch them get all up in your face, preaching about topics that make sure you know just how evil they are, which becomes tiresome very quickly. Far Cry 5 devotes too much time in belabouring the point here, and the few attempts to try and capture your sympathy for their cause feel cheap. Part of their plan in making sure you really, really, really hate them is capturing and hurting major allies. Scenes of violence against them will make you wince and are supposed to be motivators, but the reality is that you'll likely only have spoken to these people once or twice before, if at all, and won't have formed any real attachment.The other quest giver characters are mostly extreme caricatures you'll either love or hate, but you're not asked to put much investment in their livelihood outside of the outrageous quests they give you. They'll send you on adventures that show you the goofy side of Far Cry, from hunting down alien turkeys for a mad scientist or watching bovine mate as Marvin Gaye's Sexual Healing plays. These missions feel more in line with the freewheeling spirit of Far Cry than anything that directly involves the Seed family.The Seed family missions ultimately aren't an enormous detraction, but there are additional gripes. Weapons and vehicles that have the capacity to be purchased with real-world money take prominent positions in every shop menu, and their connection to an online storefront also seems to increase the loading time of these menus, which is annoying if all you want to do is swap weapons. And, despite Far Cry 5's unquestionably relevant, religiously and politically volatile setting, the game doesn't do or say anything interesting with it beyond a few hammy jabs here and there. It's unchallenging satire, and for all the attention paid to the Seed family, you would expect there to be something more.But there are so many more simple, experiential joys to be found in Far Cry 5. The exhilarating feel of jumping off a mountain and flying through the skies in a wingsuit. The idle chit-chat between your Specialists. Fishing in one of the many rivers or lakes for hours on end. Petting your animal companions. Flying a plane for the first time in the series. The taut and precise gunplay. The relaxing feeling of cruising down a picturesque highway in a 70s muscle car, listening to the great selection of classic American (and one Australian) rock and country tunes on the radio.If you'd rather experience this with someone who is a little more autonomous, or you prefer your worlds to be a little more bonkers, Far Cry 5 also includes a couple of major features: two-player online co-op for the campaign, and Far Cry Arcade. Co-op has a few restrictions--the host is the only player who can control Specialists, initiate quests, or have mission-specific progress saved. Being unable to truly advance through the campaign together with a friend is a disappointing omission, but if you're happy to simply be that extra Gun For Hire, there is a lot of joy to be found in sharing Far Cry's exciting impromptu moments--and you can rave about it with them immediately afterward.Arcade houses the game's custom map editor, allowing you to build and play your own single-player, co-op, or competitive multiplayer maps, or play ones uploaded by the rest of the community.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3cf40b4-6189-452e-adae-dd8f29d3fd3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3cf40b4-6189-452e-adae-dd8f29d3fd3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "05f621d0-bc0e-46c2-87f2-c4851b1e78bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c61f3391cd020a262c8605fa8822fcde6a8be2a1afdcd1f8faecc39a080a7956"}, "3": {"node_id": "b32f1812-863f-4be8-bda8-82f92926034f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7aa70937225efe1c4fc4a394b18a8f58e0ff6943f0824d6b5b685d65610df992"}}, "hash": "b9bd56809ec42823c9d8069fc3319b75763034ba69b3d4ef320a801cfdaf2b55", "text": "While the process of jumping into custom maps requires a lot of patience to cater to potentially lengthy download and loading times, Arcade allows for the possibilities of a diverse array of levels and game modes that are far removed from the tone and rules of the main game (Although, the Hope County denizen that pimps Far Cry Arcade deserves a mention as the most irritating character in the game). The editor itself is robust, and its asset library is generous, offering resources from Ubisoft games like Watch Dogs and Assassin's Creed on top of existing Far Cry titles. As you might expect, it will take you some time to become completely familiar with it, but with diligence, it's obvious that the results can be amazing. Levels created by Ubisoft are a nice showcase of how interesting things can get, but there are a lot of bland examples out there, too. It's easy to weed out the duds when picking and choosing single-player levels, but when it comes to multiplayer, you leave some of it up to chance. Three players in a multiplayer lobby are selected to pick an upcoming map, with the rest of the lobby voting between them and a server-selected option.There are already some wonderful PvP maps--a pirate-themed shanty town and a recreation of Counter-Strike's famous de_dust2 were nice surprises, but there is a fair share of ugly, empty maps with poorly thought-out modifiers. Enclosed caves with infinite ammo (the sound and vibration of grenades constantly going off got pretty unpleasant) and one-hit kill modes in arenas with no cover just aren't that fun. It's great to see that people are experimenting with the tool, but you're not required to publish any of your work, so it's a little annoying. Post-match, you're asked to like or dislike a map to help with ratings, so we're hopeful that after a while, the cream will float to the top.If you like to gamble, there's also the option for Arcade Hero, a version where you can opt to play new and relatively unplayed maps. It's evident that there aren't a lot of people willing to try out multiplayer maps in this fashion since I wasn't able to find a match in Arcade Hero, but I encountered some interesting ideas in the single player version. You're awarded bonus experience towards your Far Cry Arcade progression if you participate in Arcade Hero modes, and levelling this up will reward you with in-game currency and Perk Points, which you can bring over to the campaign.Despite some brief irritations and missed opportunities with its narrative, spending time in the world of Hope County remains absolutely delightful. Far Cry 5 boasts a wonderfully harmonious flow to its adventure, with its smart changes to exploration, discovery, and progression distinctly bolstering the enjoyment of creatively engaging and experimenting with its spectacular open world.  Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:A horrible story ruins an enjoyable worldFar Cry 5 had the potential to say something interesting by setting the game in America, but its murky story and themes do more to taint the game\u2019s fantastic and playful open world than to give it purpose and meaning. The goofy world and the serious story never line up, making this one of the rockiest entries in a series that has already delved so deeply into action tourism. It\u2019s yet another mainstream game that takes crisis or tragedy and builds a Ferris wheel on top of it, while intimating that you\u2019re bad for wanting to take a ride.Far Cry 5\u2019s story starts on a hollow note and never improves. The Project at Eden\u2019s Gate, a religious cult whose followers are pejoratively called \u201cpeggies,\u201d wants to carve out a chunk of land in the U.S. where its members can enjoy their religion and guns without being harassed by the government. You, of course, represent the government. As a deputy sheriff, you initially try, and fail, to arrest their leader, Joseph Seed, in a lengthy action scene that ends with you being rescued by a \u201cprepper\u201d who just so happens to be ready for exactly this sort of situation. It\u2019s a timely story that could at least try to address the polarized nature of current American politics, or talk about the issues inherent in a country that seems to worship firearms. But I never saw anything that hinted at how these cultists were radicalized. And their ultimate goal, revealed at the end of the game, undercuts any grand statement.The \u201ceveryone is bad!\u201d argument pops up often. In one jaw-dropping sequence, you leave a scene of torture perpetrated by the bad guys, only to end up in the bunker of the \u201cgood guys.\u201d Guess what they\u2019re doing? If you said \u201ctorturing someone to get information,\u201d you win.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b32f1812-863f-4be8-bda8-82f92926034f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b32f1812-863f-4be8-bda8-82f92926034f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3cf40b4-6189-452e-adae-dd8f29d3fd3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9bd56809ec42823c9d8069fc3319b75763034ba69b3d4ef320a801cfdaf2b55"}, "3": {"node_id": "6bd5597e-cb25-4793-962a-cab68acbcc3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "afc8cf131d04c6dd39d5e5b66f793626a3878b1a6c72880101da77bd20676399"}}, "hash": "7aa70937225efe1c4fc4a394b18a8f58e0ff6943f0824d6b5b685d65610df992", "text": "If you said \u201ctorturing someone to get information,\u201d you win. These two situations literally happen back to back, without anyone in the game remarking on it. You can be in a cult, or you can fight a cult, but torture is worth it and effective either way!Equally flabbergasting is that many of the peggies are taking part in this violence because of a drug called \u201cbliss.\u201d You can tell when characters are under the influence of the drug from the green cloud around their heads; bliss is used as a shortcut to get away from realistic storytelling and dive back into tired video game tropes. A boss fight with a character who warps around the level, complete with a health bar, is as ridiculous and pointless as it sounds. The drug is meant to dehumanize the characters, so you feel more like you\u2019re gunning down zombies than humans. However, the game totally fails to recognize the horror of shooting American drug addicts while the nation deals with a very real ongoing opioid crisis.The general absence of context in Far Cry 5 feels intentional, as if to smooth over any potentially controversial edges. You\u2019re fighting against a conservative religious cult that has taken control of a big chunk of Montana, which made some conservative and Christian commentators uncomfortable during the game\u2019s initial marketing. Those folks shouldn\u2019t worry; any thematic point to be made about religion, the United States or the current state of the nation\u2019s politics is quickly thrown aside to make way for all sorts of jokes and lighthearted hijinks \u2014 although you\u2019ll also see a lot of crucifixions in your travels. It\u2019s clear that this is a cult based on Christianity, but holy hell, is the game careful to dance around that fact. Ubisoft wanted the evocative art of these religious references for the marketing of Far Cry 5, but the game itself is too timid to do anything with them, let alone dig into their historical baggage.Even the lead character is a blank slate. You have no name or backstory other than being in law enforcement. You get to choose whether you look masculine or feminine before diving into the robust character creator to craft your look, from skin tone to clothing. You\u2019re called either \u201cdeputy\u201d or \u201crookie\u201d as the game progresses, and you never speak. This must have made it easier for Ubisoft to offer co-op through the entire story (even if only one player is able to make progress in the story in their saved game in this mode), but it\u2019s definitely a shift from past Far Cry games, which made the player character a large part of the world and lore. It\u2019s a shame that Far Cry 5 is propped up by a weak story with bland characters, because behind the plot is an open world filled with what Far Cry as a series does best. Between story missions, you\u2019ll be assaulting bases and tackling side missions to regain control of geographic areas, and you\u2019ll unlock a progressively impressive list of vehicles to get around the countryside. That includes planes, in a series first, although the flying controls are so arcadey that the inclusion doesn\u2019t feel like a huge departure from previous games. Bombing runs against cult convoys sure are satisfying, though. All of Hope County, Montana, is unlocked the moment you stagger out of the bunker in the game\u2019s opening \u2014 nothing is gated, and hunting has been demoted to a sport that\u2019s only done for money. That\u2019s right: You don\u2019t have to kill adorable wildlife to make progress or upgrade your gear. Improving your character is done through the perk system, and you earn points by completing challenges like killing a certain number of enemies with explosives. You\u2019ll also find perk upgrades in the bunkers you raid from doomsday preppers who have fled the area. Briefly, on preppers: There\u2019s this strange subtext to Far Cry 5 that will openly tell you that preppers were right to fear the worst, but it\u2019s undercut by the fact that so many of them fled when things got bad. I guess they weren\u2019t as willing to fight against an insurrection as they thought? The preppers were planning for a war that would require them to take their country back, while the followers of the Project at Eden\u2019s Gate are also attempting to take their country back, and your job is to take the country back from them. The contrasting ideas there are some of the more complicated and funny aspects of this whole mess, but the game does little with this idea of entitlement. It\u2019s yet another wasted opportunity.The lack of story depth is a shame, because this is one of, if not the best, playgrounds in the Far Cry series.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bd5597e-cb25-4793-962a-cab68acbcc3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bd5597e-cb25-4793-962a-cab68acbcc3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "b32f1812-863f-4be8-bda8-82f92926034f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7aa70937225efe1c4fc4a394b18a8f58e0ff6943f0824d6b5b685d65610df992"}, "3": {"node_id": "f9c0bf1f-1daa-4af2-9271-20c8501688e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e78017d8ecec09b1f3f4d6aaeed501508579ad51bbec5e103af95c7da1acea2f"}}, "hash": "afc8cf131d04c6dd39d5e5b66f793626a3878b1a6c72880101da77bd20676399", "text": "Far Cry 5 feels like Ubisoft Montreal has learned which parts of the past games felt like work and which parts were fun, and it has focused with great intensity on producing more of those fun parts. A character even cracks a joke about not forcing you to climb towers around Hope County, a wink at one of the series\u2019 most overused side objectives. Every part of Far Cry 5\u2019s systems for progression and reward feel tuned to within an inch of perfection, and my favorite hours of the game were spent fishing, exploring the open world, and gaining more perks and tackling the interesting little puzzles that make up each prepper stash.Montana itself is modeled with an eye toward the region\u2019s natural beauty, and the setting looked wondrous in my time playing on a PlayStation 4 Pro hooked up to a 4K display. The nature-trotting portions of the game feel like a commercial for the state. I want to take a break from murdering all those cultists to just camp for a few days, but alas, there\u2019s always someone around who needs killing. The game does at least reward your fishing efforts. I wonder how much more I\u2019d enjoy Far Cry 5 with a combat-free tourism mode akin to the recent add-on for its sibling series, Assassin\u2019s Creed.I also appreciated the unexpected silliness of Far Cry 5. One of the best additions to the game is an escort system that allows you to hire and fight alongside up to two other characters from a pool of people you meet in the game, each of whom brings special skills into combat. That\u2019s all well and good \u2014 it\u2019s nice to have a sniper who\u2019s got your back \u2014 but you can also befriend and hire animal buddies to help you in your travels. I stopped paying attention to the human sidekicks after I started prowling around Montana with a cougar and a dog as my companions.The animal hijinks don\u2019t stop there. During one liberation mission, I aimed at a cultist, missed my shot and accidentally freed a bear. The bear was set on fire somehow, and the fire-bear ate a bunch of people while I watched through my weapon\u2019s scope. That was a pretty good time. And I can\u2019t count the amount of times I rescued friendly citizens from the militia, only to have them be eaten by cougars. Far Cry 5 also introduces an arcade mode (playable solo and in co-op) that includes a powerful map editor, allowing you to create challenges and share them with other players, who can earn cash and perks that will be helpful in the campaign. The arcade mode is accessible through the arcade cabinets you find around Hope County. I had a blast playing through some of the early levels created by Ubisoft\u2019s designers, including one strange experience that took place in a topsy-turvy haunted house. Hopefully the community will come up with some interesting stuff after launch.For now, we\u2019re left with the core campaign. Far Cry 5 uses the religious and isolationist divides in America to set up a story without ever addressing their history and their very present danger, and the story seems to give most of your enemies a get-out-of-jail-free card to explain their actions.They weren\u2019t bad; they were just drugged! And the main antagonist, well. if you hadn\u2019t picked a fight, maybe none of this would have happened! This sort of argument \u2014 that you are complicit in the violence that the game portrays and the villains take part in because you decided to play the game \u2014 was interesting when Spec Ops: The Line did it back in 2012, but has grown tiresome in the repetitions since. Far Cry 5 makes fun of everyone on the political spectrum, without ever taking a clear stand except to say, with toothless confidence, that murderous cults are bad. But maybe fighting them makes you just as bad, and in the end none of this matters anyway! It\u2019s a story that goes nowhere and ends with a whimper, at least in the ending I saw. There seem to be two endings, although I doubt there\u2019s a way to salvage the narrative in the last minutes after so many blown opportunities.What\u2019s left if you have the stomach to ignore the story? A very enjoyable game with an immense number of things to do, a beautifully recreated portion of the United States, and a collection of missions with wildly varying tones and structure. It\u2019s a finely tuned open-world game stapled onto a story that\u2019s insultingly bad.Far Cry 5 was reviewed using a final \u201cretail\u201d PlayStation 4 download code provided by Ubisoft.

There's probably a great story you could tell around a Christian Doomsday Prepper Cult that has you fighting them off as they prepare for the End Times by murdering everyone around them and stealing all the resources they can. That's meat that few games even attempt to chew. But the ambitious setting doesn't pay off in this story that seems to want to hedge every chance it gets. The end result is a story that goes nowhere, says nothing, and fails to live up to the previous settings and villains in the franchise. If you can get past that... the rest is pretty much fine if you're up for another Far Cry game.The cult you're fighting has four leaders. Three control territories, and once you've executed enough missions in those territories, you can take that area back. Take over all three territories and you'll trigger the game's final mission against the Father, Joseph Seed, who looks and acts like a C-tier Matthew McConaughey character. Each cult lieutenant gets a bit of screen time as the game very much overuses the idea of you getting captured and hauled off to listen to a bunch of rudimentary rambling from the torture guy who looks like a low-rent coke dealer, the lady pumping hallucinogens into the water to ensure an orderly flock, or the ex-military guy who wants to train people like they were Pavlov's dogs. I found that most of the long speeches from these characters just go in circles and don't actually give any of them any real weight. They aren't charismatic the way Pagan Min was, they aren't menacing the way Vaas was, either. They seem flat. Monotonous, even.The lack of conviction in Far Cry 5 permeates the entire product. It doesn't just make its bad guys feel like generic, uncharismatic cultists. The militias and other characters you befriend along the way are also just... there. Maybe it'd be interesting to know why this particular valley in Montana has multiple militias and what their whole deal is beyond \"we're a militia and we hate this cult.\" Maybe it'd be nice if you occasionally met a meaningful character who wasn't already armed and talking about what's up with \"their squad\" mere days after the cult started going nuts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "069fe1ad-46c9-477f-9cd3-56a1d2d886d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "069fe1ad-46c9-477f-9cd3-56a1d2d886d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9c0bf1f-1daa-4af2-9271-20c8501688e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e78017d8ecec09b1f3f4d6aaeed501508579ad51bbec5e103af95c7da1acea2f"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e837196-f4b8-4b2c-86ad-35fb45f82fe4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f86773357e4cbbcf595476e518ebabbfd14e54387715a9873f7d4812cddf03e3"}}, "hash": "3d9b8433124759b7d0bbf42b6f4582215b03a944eddd2a7eac4eff60dbdeb50a", "text": "For as much as it's disappointing that the villains aren't given enough dramatic weight, the way the game portrays rural America is somehow even darker. Everyone is either crazy, stupid, or both. Multiple missions involve \"getting someone's truck back, aw shucks, we sure loved that truck.\" Meanwhile, after you've rescued dozens of people including a guy who owns a freakin' airplane, no one thinks to revisit the game's first idea of \"we should drive to Missoula and get on the phone to someone about this.\" In the end, most NPCs are just people holding guns, wearing distressed American flag T-shirts, telling you about some paramilitary shit they got into or want to get into. Meanwhile, the first \"good\" prepper you meet is a vet with a USA jacket and a Canadian accent. It doesn't feel like a believable portrayal of rural life, even rural life under extreme duress.Because so much of the game traffics in mindgames, either via Faith Seed's drugs or Jacob Seed's brainwashing--large parts of the game's biggest moments are spent with the screen all filtered or wavy because you're \"not right in the head.\" You'll see things that might not be there, you'll do things that would definitely be impossible, you'll see stuff that couldn't possibly be happening. That's fine, up to a point. Beating one of the cult lieutenants who can seemingly teleport around at will, control minds directly, and both fly and shoot fireballs at you during her boss fight is a decent departure from reality, but with so much of the game leaning on this seemingly supernatural stuff, it's hard to take any of it seriously.I guess I won't get into specifics, but did the earth-shaking events of the final confrontation even happen? Considering you're able to load back into the world after the credits and play like nothing happened, I want to say that it was all just another drug trip in a game with far too many drug trips. It only further undermines the potential of setting a Far Cry game in Montana and taking on a religious cult. At one point the leader of the cult gives the generic \"free will is an illusion, maaaaan\" speech and I nearly started just skipping cutscenes. The story leans on altered states and empty words too heavily and feels utterly weightless as a result.The rest of it is fairly par for the course when it comes to Far Cry. Some changes have been made around the edges, some are improvements, some aren't. The more organic way you happen upon side missions and fill out your map is a nice touch. You'll find friendly AI characters out in the woods who will tell you \"hey, this youth camp has been turned into a cult outpost, we should go kill 'em\" and that will pop an outpost marker on your map. Or you might just stumble into the outpost while going from place to place. The cultists like to hold hostages, and saving a hostage usually gives you a person who will fill in another point on the map. This is a meaningful step up from the old \"climb tower, populate region\" style.Despite multiple missions dealing with truck recovery, the missions usually feel like they fit into the world more organically, too. The game feels less like a set of checklists while also helpfully contextualizing the overtly checklist-y quests like \"destroy all cult equipment in this region\" or \"save X hostages in this region.\" There are interesting little \"prepper stashes\" that require a bit of puzzling out to unlock. The game has its share of goofy side characters, some of which work, while others most definitely do not. I'd also argue that the goofy side characters further take away from the potential for a weighty main story, but considering how far off the mark the game is with the tone of its main quests, the idiots on the side were a lot more welcome.Player progression has been rebuilt via an in-game achievement system instead of the standard experience points and perk trees. Doing specific things, like getting 10 pistol kills, gives you points that can be spent on perks. Most perks don't have any prerequisites, so you can more or less grow your character as you see fit. That said, being forced to play the game in stunty ways, like getting flamethrower kills even though the flamethrower isn't a particularly great or fun or useful weapon, is pretty lame. The crafting system of hunting to get specific skins to build specific upgrade is also gone. Instead you'll sell skins for money and there are achievements (and, thus, perk points) for skinning a set number of each animal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e837196-f4b8-4b2c-86ad-35fb45f82fe4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e837196-f4b8-4b2c-86ad-35fb45f82fe4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "069fe1ad-46c9-477f-9cd3-56a1d2d886d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d9b8433124759b7d0bbf42b6f4582215b03a944eddd2a7eac4eff60dbdeb50a"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f0b4130-ae20-41cf-a0cc-394d25eec5fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "02a1cb7823bb472dd5efdba0272a5eeb7bfab5c401fb905714e1fc9582d68bac"}}, "hash": "f86773357e4cbbcf595476e518ebabbfd14e54387715a9873f7d4812cddf03e3", "text": "The old system better rewarded you for playing the game the way you want to play it while making hunting feel like it mattered, and this system feels like a real step back.The weapon selection is also weirdly weak. It's broken up into categories, but you'll see multiple weapons in some categories with the exact same stats, like different models of an AK-47 and such. This is made even weirder by the game's gun customization options, which offers skins and attachments for everything. Why have two of the same rifle for sale in the menu? Why isn't one of them just a skin for the other? The arsenal feels light, as a result. Also, getting into a store seems to take an extra second or two, like it's hitting a server or something. Considering there are \"prestige weapons\" and other skins that you can optionally buy with a premium, real-money currency, maybe that's why it takes so long to get into the store. While some of the skins, vehicle paint jobs, and outfits are fun, Far Cry 5 is a first-person game. You barely ever see that stuff when you're playing the game.Far Cry 5 is, at times, very fidgety and glitchy. I ran into multiple quest-bearing NPCs who ran off mid-sentence and refused to activate again, forcing me to quit and restart. One such character was in the middle of telling me that he couldn't swim, then he got into an actively scared \"there's an enemy nearby\" state and immediately swam away. Pretty good form, too. One boss fight simply instructs you to kill the boss, so I pulled out my sniper rifle and smoked him. But he'll pop right back up, awkwardly, if you do it that way. You need to get up close so you can trigger a cutscene death. At one point in the game you're being constantly hunted by planes, but getting spotted by a plane doesn't activate enemies on the ground, so I was able to stealthily take over an outpost while also being bombarded and strafed from above. Characters flop around the environment, your AI helpers use their loud voices in stealth situations and sometimes use their stealth voices in open combat... while some of these glitches are funny and all, there are a few too many of them. They've been making these games for years, you'd figure some of this stuff would have been cleaned up a bit better by now.The game has a map editor and a whole separate mode called Far Cry Arcade that lets you share, play, and rate user-created levels and multiplayer maps. Some of the outposts and assault missions I've seen in these early days have been pretty good, and you'll earn some cash and perk points to take back into the campaign, but after 20 hours of finishing Far Cry 5 and messing around a bit with some arcade maps, I'm just not sure that I need an infinite array of mini Far Cry levels. The campaign was more than enough. The Arcade mode is well-made, though the competitive multiplayer doesn't feel great.A big part of the cult leader's final plea to you as the player is a large speech about how you're the real monster, running around the environment and murdering everything in your path. He even goes so far as to say that there are some problems that can't be solved with a bullet. But aside from a good ending/bad ending choice, a gimmicky fake early ending that was done better in Far Cry 4, and one or two minor points along the way, Far Cry 5 isn't a game about choice--unless you count the choice of which cult leader you're going to kill first. You might not be able to solve every problem with a bullet, but when the game only gives you bullets to work with, you aren't left with too many other real options. It seems like a dumb move on the writers' part to shine such a bright spotlight on how inflexible their open-world game actually is, but that's Far Cry 5. A decent video game undermined by bad pacing, weak characters, and a wishy-washy world view. Play it cooperatively with a friend, ignore the characters and their motivations, and you'll probably have a good time.\u00a9 2023 FANDOM, INC.

For all its nods to contemporary politics and societal strife, Far Cry 5 is just another fun permutation of the usual Far Cry formula with nothing very interesting to say.Ubisoft\u2019s latest open-world first-person shooter depicts a society on the edge from the point of view of a small midwestern town cut off from the rest of the country. Creative director Dan Hay has said as much in interview after interview, stemming, he\u2019s said, from anxiety following the financial crisis of the last decade. The game does try to clumsily tap into a pervasive sense in the real world that something\u2019s got to give. In the game, we\u2019ve got heavily armed Americans beginning to fight back against other heavily armed Americans. In real life, we\u2019ve got Neonazis and Antifa brawling, endless polarization by the United States\u2019 major political parties, worsening climate change and a dotard wandering the White House with access to the launch codes. Far Cry 5\u2019s sense of the end times thus has a ring of truth to it, but the game has no idea where to take things from there.The game plays well, with you in the role of unnamed deputy (male or female, in a series first) fighting back against the cult. Its depiction of a growing resistance makes for a compelling mission flow, but it does a terrible job of integrating the extreme violence that makes it all work with the believable community of diverse individuals you spend the game getting to know. Far Cry stories have never lived up to their premise. Take the idea of a spoiled 20-something becoming a deadly killer overnight in Far Cry 3. That missed potential hits hardest with Far Cry 5. Joseph Seed is supposed to be a charismatic cult leader taking in those who feel alienated and left behind. At no point, however, did his supposed appeal come through in the game. He did not evoke the charisma of, say, the cult leader David Koresh, as played by Taylor Kitsch in the recent Waco miniseries that retold the infamous 51-day siege of a religious compound in Texas in 1993. For all his talk of economic anxiety and attempts to offer an alternative to the turmoil of modern politics, Seed\u2019s arrival in Hope County and subsequent reign are fueled only by violence and fear. One of the game\u2019s first characters, a Vietnam veteran named Dutch, is praised by others in the game as being one of the first to see through Joseph\u2019s rhetoric. I can\u2019t help but wonder what gave it away: the public displays of mutilated bodies crucified with rebar or the hordes of wandering \u201cangels,\u201d cultists who overdosed on Bliss and now have a penchant for bludgeoning people to death.It would be easier to forgive the game\u2019s glib cartoonishness if it weren\u2019t for all the work it does trying to invite comparisons to contemporary America real world. The game is keen to gesture whenever it can to America\u2019s current political moment.The cigar smoking, rifle-cradling conservative Hurk Drubman Sr. (father to the long-running Far Cry character of the same name) asks you to help his campaign for state office by suppressing the vote. One of Joseph\u2019s brothers, Jacob, is messed up from seeing wolves eat his buddy while lost in the desert during the first Gulf War. The game depicts an America infatuated with guns, a theme that proves disturbingly current. At the same time that the cultists worship at church armed to the teeth, there was an actual cult blessing their AR-15s weeks after one was used to commit a mass school shooting. Joseph\u2019s sermons, played on the radio and on TV broadcasts, talk about the failure of politicians to fix what\u2019s wrong with the country and the need to look inward for meaning in a world that cares only about profit. If the cult were real, Wolf Blitzer would have already interviewed its leader twice.All of the games allusions to real American problems, along with the generally mind-bending psychopathy of the cult, are at odds with the majority of what you see, hear and do in the game, the further you get from its cutscenes. The bulk of Far Cry 5 feels like gonzo camping trip that permeates the rest of the game. Yes, people are being kidnapped, tortured, and brainwashed, but in-between fighting to liberate the residents of Hope County from this b-horror movie plot, I also spent plenty of time skydiving, swimming, hiking, hunting, fishing, and rampaging through cedar forests on 4-wheelers at night like an idiot.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5948248d-1f2f-4e5d-9e74-4024ea1cb696": {"__data__": {"id_": "5948248d-1f2f-4e5d-9e74-4024ea1cb696", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f0b4130-ae20-41cf-a0cc-394d25eec5fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "02a1cb7823bb472dd5efdba0272a5eeb7bfab5c401fb905714e1fc9582d68bac"}, "3": {"node_id": "ed017a16-b27d-4ccd-af97-75c5140f0f92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41001dd521e2be24ea104e0c10f37d3b21d2ab2a9d2b50e040d41e687503e1bc"}}, "hash": "f354cb8abb588f1fd0100e308b59e3944481482684dfa480e7f48f4013c5bda6", "text": "I\u2019d like to say this mix of the Huffington Post front page and a Bass Pro Shop catalog ends up being complementary, but it doesn\u2019t work, with the split between ominous main plot and absurd side adventures feeling even more dissonant than in earlier Far Cry games. Far Cry 5 doesn\u2019t have warring political factions or a well-defined protagonist\u2019s descent into madness to help anchor its gamey patchwork of interlocking systems and over the top caricatures. There\u2019s just you, a sheriff\u2019s deputy with no backstory, motivation, or emotions of her own, negotiating one disorienting swing from hyper violence to charming absurdity after another. Away from the main plot and if you can ignore the potential for greater thematic complexity the setting presented, Far Cry 5 actually shines.After the opening cinematics and a short stint on a small tutorial island, the entirety of Hope County opens up. Recent Far Cry environments have been tropical, Himalayan or prehistoric. Far Cry 5\u2019s are pedestrian North American landscapes full of pine forests, tall mountain ranges, and flat farmlands carved up by clear, winding rivers.This map, which publisher Ubisoft claims convincingly is bigger than any of the previous Far Cry games, is sliced into three regions, each controlled by one of Joseph\u2019s siblings who you must assassinate in order to get to him. Doing so requires building up a \u201cresistance meter\u201d for each region by completing missions, rescuing hostages, and blowing up buildings controlled by Peggies (what locals have lovingly nicknamed the worshippers of the Seed\u2019s cult, the Project at  Eden\u2019s Gate). Filling up meters might sound boring, but here they\u2019re a revelation. Instead of needing to follow a crumb trail of main story quests constantly bringing you into contact with Joseph you can effectively do whatever you want and have it contribute to the overall resistance effort. It\u2019s a license to go out, explore, and have weird things happen free from the narrative constraints that bound previous games.Your map of the area starts off mostly shrouded in fog. As you explore more of it, collect maps, and complete objectives, sections fill in. You\u2019ll learn, for example, that between these two hills is a person\u2019s house and across the river is a gas station that needs to be liberated from cultists and converted into a place where you can shop for guns, cars, and helicopters. Re-capturing a landmark generally reveals characters who will offer new missions for you. Distractions are constant. A character may ask you to steal back their beloved semi-truck from enemy hands or find a missing pet mountain lion, and just as they end their sentence, a Peggie truck oil tanker may drive by. Blowing it up will help the resistance, so off you go. Once you\u2019ve apprehended the vehicle, killed the driver, and either destroyed or looted it, you might even hear a cry for help from farther down the road or somewhere off into the woods. Two Peggies are proselytizing at someone tied up beside them, so you pick them off quickly with a couple of headshots, untie the person, and lo and behold they heard that their friend Hank who lives just down the road is about to get raided and so now you have to go check that out too. This is how missions cascade in Far Cry 5, all of which can be played in full co-op online, including the main story, a first for the series (although story progress only counts for the hosting player). Sometimes missions emerge conventionally. A named character asks you to go to a marker on your map and kill or bring back whatever\u2019s there. Other times the missions seem to arise by accident. The game\u2019s quest-givers, like its enemy patrol cars and emergent wildlife, tend to show up when you aren\u2019t looking, rather than being pegged to specific locations.Then there are the infamous Far Cry anecdotes, a storytelling genre unto themselves, in which otherwise common game activities like killing everyone you see and blowing shit up lead to unpredictable outcomes. What had previously just been another side mission to check off of a list is transformed into something special, in part because it was somehow the culmination of events you the player set in motion. Far Cry 5 has those too, but its wide range of independent characters augments them in interesting ways.One night my character was getting bombed out of her mind in an abandoned campground turned drug lab on the southeastern edge of the map.

Near death and sprinting\u2014a condition I\u2019ve spent at least half of Far Cry 5 in\u2014I climbed onto the roof of one of the buildings, aimed at the plane as it bore down on me for another strike, and chucked a stick of dynamite. Seconds later an explosion lit up the night sky. Another followed as the flaming wreckage slammed straight into armed convoy that had just shown up. It was a great Far Cry moment. As unwanted as the initial encounter was it ended up blossoming into something memorable, at least for me if not Tweak, my comrade who was happy to pick up our business exactly where it had left off. This kind of thing happened in other Far Cry games, too, but in this one it happens around characters I grew to care about. I like Tweak. He is weird. He lives in a hangout filled with mannequins posed just like people who once resided there. The walls of his lab are lined with phrases like \u201cHe lied!\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d scrawled in chalk. It\u2019s creepy, as is Tweak\u2019s upbringing, which unsent letters to his father will attest, but he\u2019s turned to concocting medicinals to try and combat the effects of the Bliss on the community. I\u2019ve been harassed by countless planes and helicopters while playing this Far Cry game, often out of the blue, but the ensuing firefights became a part of something much more interesting when they inevitably happened around characters I had learned to care about.Far Cry 5\u2019s hired gun system, one that\u2019s been evolving since Far Cry 2 and now includes animals like in Far Cry Primal, plays a big part in forging these connections to characters. There are nine major human or animal characters you can befriend and invite with you on missions, each with unique attributes. They range from a dog who can spot and fight enemies to a chatty pilot who provides air support. In addition, randomly generated characters you encounter in the world can be hired, though they\u2019re not as useful and have less interesting things to say while traveling with you. At a basic level, it\u2019s great to be trying to take down an enemy outpost and have someone watching your back who can revive you and also take out enemies you highlight with the direction pad. The system works flawlessly. There\u2019s also an upgrade that allows you to bring two companions at a time, allowing you more avenues of attack and also providing an incentive to play the game on hard to keep things interesting. In terms of the game\u2019s emergent story, however, having these hired guns also helps you build relationships beyond the original missions in which you met them. When I first encountered Jess Black, she was trying to get revenge on a cannibal, several hours later she\u2019s saved my neck more times then I can count and her macabre personality seems a good fit for the carnage we witness together.\"What if religion but too much.\"Skydiving shoot \u2018em upAll the people I met along the side of the road.Getting kidnapped by the game every so often and being forced to listen to bad poetry about the end times.

Five more playing around in co-op and Far Cry Arcade.There are limits to these interactions, and this is where Far Cry 5 shows its shortcomings in significantly evolving beyond its aging formula. Sure, these buddies seem more sentient than the average Far Cry character, but most of the people in this game world seem exceedingly clueless. Despite the atrocities going on around them, Hope County\u2019s residents remain mostly chipper and good natured. This resilience often feels uplifting and humanizing. When I\u2019m methodically skinning bears and mistakenly shooting civilians though, their continued solidarity and obliviousness of most of the game\u2019s characters wears thin. Blowing up a van of prisoners invites a stern warning from the game not to kill innocents, but my neighbors barely react and don\u2019t hold grudges long.

The system is functional but short-lived and limited. One challenge involved killing and skinning five bison, so, in the interest of gaining more perks, I looked across my map for bison. My map had a marker for bison ever since I\u2019d collected a magazine in a bunker nearby.  (Like just about everything in the game, from cult outposts to neighbors houses, hunting sites only appear as such once you\u2019ve discovered them yourself or found a collectible noting the location.) I would find the bison in a  field just off the side of the road next to a river. I pulled out my .50 caliber and got to work. Two shots a piece. Of all the game\u2019s varied wildlife, the bison are some of the easiest to kill. A wolverine hiding in the tall grass nearby caused more trouble than all of them combined. Unlike in previous games, animal parts aren\u2019t used for crafting in Far Cry 5. Instead, gun enhancements are bought outright, and animal skins are collected to satisfy the requirements of specific quests or just sold for cash. I killed a lot of animals in the game, as is par for the course in every Far Cry. In Far Cry 5, however, it\u2019s connection to American outdoorsmanship somehow makes it feel more self-indulgent and evil. After all, here I am with military-grade weapons bringing to the ground with relative ease not just one or two but eight bison and counting. I got three more than I needed because even though the pained groans of a bison are unsettling, their hides fetch $200 a piece and the 1911 Extended pistol I\u2019d been coveting costs a small fortune.After skinning their corpses, I saw some camping equipment not far off by a downed tree. There I found a small abandoned backpack, toolbox, and cooler upon which sat a note, from no one in particular, which read: \u201cA baby bison is called a \u2018red dog\u2019 because the people who name things lack basic education. Also, humans slaughtered 50 million of them. 50 MILLION!\u201d With one cutting bit of flavor text the game made me feel like an asshole for trying to use the systems it had put in place to develop my character. It also hinted at a legacy of real world violence the game is content to mine for moral significance and weight without doing much to tackle it head on. No one in Hope County will pop out of the woods to chastise you for poaching or call your methods into question. Violence is simply the way of things, and as in past games, Far Cry 5 isn\u2019t interested in calling that into question beyond the occasional subtext or poorly conceived monologue spoken by someone with no room to point fingers.On January 23, 1870, Colonel Eugene Baker led a raid on a camp of Blackfeet Native Americans in Northern Montana. His soldiers killed some 37 men, 90 women, and 50 children for, admittedly, no reason other than that the Montanans were afraid of them. Now dubbed the Marias Massacre, The New York Times called it a \u201cshocking affair\u201d at the time, while the New North-West of Deer Lodge, Montana countered that these critics were simply \u201cnamby-pamby, sniffling old maid sentimentalists.\u201d While the occasional note in Far Cry 5 might grapple with this past, the game\u2019s characters refrain from engaging in complex debates around American history, gun culture or religious fundamentalism. It would have been a richer game if it at least mined its setting for more than cultural knick-knacks designed to be the butt of some joke. Nearly every corner of Hope County oozes a sense of patriotic bravado, only this time it\u2019s aimed, barrels loaded, at a sect of religious extremists. Notably, hardly anyone ever talks about trying to persuade some of the cultists to leave Joseph\u2019s \u201cflock,\u201d and there\u2019s no way to capture or subdue any of them. Every attack is lethal. This, I suspect, is partly why Bliss figures so heavily into the lore of the cult and what they derive their power from. It helps erase any ethical gray area. Racial tensions, sexism, and actual political disagreements are similarly paperped over in the game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c86b64f-53eb-4f3e-b0c7-5f9fac29fb7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c86b64f-53eb-4f3e-b0c7-5f9fac29fb7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1450dea-ca82-49c8-85f4-05c097e65b20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "74ced4a7c1e7d9a1cecdf2fbe1f1471e2ddddb24ef3e639785b079ddba39da06"}, "3": {"node_id": "5501be33-4384-4d63-a7cc-055f74b1eaba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d1ad0387e3f34c01c0ca7e1e4675b501f19727754c5c8f489eeb3d32f09c43e"}}, "hash": "dac88d1b688b8638ac67016348f4a6960f90747dfff62a6b54136c359bba61d5", "text": "Racial tensions, sexism, and actual political disagreements are similarly paperped over in the game. Everyone in Hope County who isn\u2019t a Peggie gets along fine for the most part, making it even more unbelievable that a death cult would have found it so easy to take root their in the first place. Where Joseph\u2019s apocalypticism offers an obvious opportunity to dig further into the actual political divisions which might afflict place like Hope County, Far Cry 5 uses it mostly for ominous effect and narrative head-fakes.Early on I thought Far Cry 5 might actually plan on grappling with these demons, the ones its villains seem engineered to manifest in uniquely American ways. Maybe Joseph and the Peggies were symbolic of some sort of punishment for the country\u2019s larger failings beyond Hope County. The more I played, though, the more I realized that\u2019s not the case. Far Cry 5 is a flashier iteration of the past games whose newfound relationship to reality is really just another sideshow.One of the main attractions, long term at least, is likely to be the game\u2019s Far Cry Arcade. It offers a more robust level editor than past games which you could spend hours sinking time into constructing maps and missions to be shared with other players online. Perks, items, and cash you earn during these missions carry over into the main game, and although the existing Ubisoft ones are vanilla at the moment, I\u2019m confident players will eventually construct custom death traps even better than what\u2019s in the main game, not to mention whenever the Far Cry: Battle Royale mode inevitably arrives. It\u2019s a development that fits in perfectly with Ubisoft\u2019s games-as-service strategy, but one that only further dilutes the impact and weight of the game\u2019s main story. Arcade machines and posters throughout the world invite you to go play the game\u2019s eccentric multiplayer stuff. \u201cI could play this all day,\u201d characters standing over the machines say, despite the gunships constantly flying overhead.Far Cry games are laboratories for experimenting, giving you the freedom to do stuff ordinary games won\u2019t, like throw a molotov cocktail at just about anything and watch it burn to the ground. They usually have better shooting than most open world games, and better open worlds than most shooters. Far Cry 5 nails that part of the series\u2019 legacy. The game\u2019s missions flow together organically and let you shift from capturing a cult outpost using an array of explosives and guns to scaling cliffs in search of hidden caches of equipment and lore-filled collectibles. It fails, however, to meaningfully move beyond the rest of the series in merging the violence and chaos these experiments produce with the community of people scattered throughout its world. These are still silly worlds full of silly people and no amount of gravitas about the world being on the edge can be sustained in a game that so frequently sends you into hunts for cow testicles or stunt races set to the theme song of a retro daredevil. The series has always struggled with this dichotomy. It\u2019s only fitting that after several games subjecting fictional populaces from the global south to this confusion it arrives in America\u2019s backyard. The boldness of this decision, however, isn\u2019t backed up by the lackluster story or simplistic fight for liberation taking place on the ground.\nUSgamer, Ever since Far Cry 3, Ubisoft\u2019s open-world series has been about the bad guys.  These charismatic antagonists take top billing on the box art, and they taunt you across the entire adventure. Next to your protagonist  - who\u2019s usually as likeable as a men\u2019s rights activist - they bleed personality.Far Cry 5 takes this formula to its natural conclusion: now there are four antagonists and the main character is a fully customisable mute. Hooray! As an unnamed deputy, you head to Hope County, Montana, to arrest an enigmatic cult leader known as Joseph Seed. The Seed family run a religious group called the Project at Eden\u2019s Gate and have laid siege to rural America, rounding up civilians, torturing, and maiming - all in the name of God. Hallelujah. Of course, the arrest goes awry, fulfilling a prophecy Joseph predicted and embedding the cult\u2019s beliefs - martyring Joseph without killing him. Radio contact is cut off from the outside world, you are alone, and Hope County has completed its transformation into Fascist Fields.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5501be33-4384-4d63-a7cc-055f74b1eaba": {"__data__": {"id_": "5501be33-4384-4d63-a7cc-055f74b1eaba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c86b64f-53eb-4f3e-b0c7-5f9fac29fb7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dac88d1b688b8638ac67016348f4a6960f90747dfff62a6b54136c359bba61d5"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2194145-83d4-4225-988a-57b28e59c63c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d316168233b588d90ec048ba08d327816fced37213e17baa7309772c555d9b4e"}}, "hash": "9d1ad0387e3f34c01c0ca7e1e4675b501f19727754c5c8f489eeb3d32f09c43e", "text": "Hope County is split into three regions - the Henbane River, Holland Valley, and Whitetail Mountains - and each of these regions is overseen by one of Joseph\u2019s trusted advisors: John Seed lords over Holland Valley, Faith Seed enraptures the Henbane River region, and Jacob Seed instills fear into the people of Whitetail Mountains. \" Weapons have a real impact to them, and guns recoil like a bucking bull - every shot is angry and physical.\"Each of the Eden\u2019s Gate leaders has their own methods: John Seed is the cult\u2019s lawyer and rules by intimidation, Faith Seed controls the population through a drug called Bliss, and Jacob Seed recruits frontline soldiers by culling the weak. Only you and your star-spangled assault rifle, your canine companion, a couple of bears, a cougar, resistance fighters, your wingsuit, some air support, a garage full of vehicles, a flamethrower, a bow, lots of explosives, and a combine harvester can stop them. These multiple antagonists represent a structural shift for Far Cry 5. On the tutorial island, an NPC asks you to climb a radio tower. When you reach the peak, he explains that you don\u2019t need to worry - he won\u2019t have you climbing towers all over Montana. Instead of unlocking the world by clambering up vantage points, you discover points of interest by simply exploring: drive past a cult outpost and it will be on your map forever; talk to a rescued civilian and they might point you to a sidequest; free companions and they will offer up more activities. Far Cry 5 is still as stuffed with things to do as other Ubisoft games, but it never feels overwhelming because of the way it unfurls. There are no progress gates, and you can spread your time between the three regions as you wish. Everything you do - be it stealing a fuel truck, burning a Bliss field, saving citizens, doing side missions, or taking on one of the more lengthy story quests - it all feeds into a progress bar for the antagonist of that region.  \n \nEach of the Seeds must be drawn out by messing with their operations, every third of the bar triggering a big story mission. When I played Far Cry 5 at preview, I wasn\u2019t sold on this structure. It felt confusing and I ended up doing a lot of the filler missions instead of getting to the meat during my short playtime. In the context of the full game, however, it works - even if it can be a bit grindy as you slowly plug away at filling the final third of each bar.Mission quality varies, but the good outweighs the bad. Stealing bull testicles as Marvin Gaye\u2019s Sexual Healing plays over the action is a highlight. Fighting a demon moose who has been pumped full of drugs is not. Luckily, the core of the game feels stronger than ever. Weapons have a real impact to them, and guns recoil like a bucking bull - every shot is angry and physical. There\u2019s just enough auto-aim snap on console to make you feel like a sharpshooter as well, whether you are flipping between targets in an outpost or sailing down a zipline with an uzi, gunning down cultists as you go. Likewise, vehicles feel great to drive. You can get behind the wheel of a big rig and smash through roadblocks, or you can speed across dirt roads in a muscle car, its back-end fishtailing angrily with every push of the accelerator. Once you are done with the roads, you can take to the skies in helicopters and aeroplanes, strafing compounds and performing bombing runs. Or you can jetski and boat across the Henbane River.  \n \nAll three regions have their own distinct personality, too. For example, the Henbane River region is difficult to traverse by car because it\u2019s so hilly and the river itself divides the landmasses like a liquid artery. Take to the air and it comes into its own. Holland Valley, meanwhile, is best explored on four wheels, smashing through fields and barreling into cows. The unpredictability of the world keeps things fresh. \"There are some surprising bits of social commentary nestled in among the stereotypical hillbillies, survivalists, righteous priests, and alien hunters.\"Spreading fire is as much a part of Far Cry\u2019s identity as bad guys gurning into the camera, because fire is indiscriminate.

At least until you are almost murdered by a turkey. Tonally, Far Cry 5 is a strange game. There is no getting away from the real world climate it released in. Here you are, saving the northwestern US from a cult of Christian extremists, diplomacy fails within the first five minutes, and the only answer to all of your problems is a gun.  \n \nIn the lead up to release, Ubisoft made it clear that Far Cry 5 had no political statement to make, but there is no escaping the context it released in. Despite those apolitical claims, some of the dialogue is overtly political, too, though probably not in the way you might expect. At one point, one of the cult leaders breaks into a monologue about their motives, asking you if you\u2019ve seen the way the world is, if you\u2019ve seen who is in charge, if you\u2019ve seen the wars, if you have seen the walls being erected. Far Cry 5 does have a message, and that message appears to be: the world has gone to shit, and people act desperate when pushed, particularly if they have embedded belief systems. There\u2019s also a lot of hand-wringing about violence and how you are as bad as the cultists for resorting to murder to solve Hope County\u2019s issues. It\u2019s a bit cliche, but there are some surprising bits of social commentary nestled in among the stereotypical hillbillies, survivalists, righteous priests, and alien hunters. I just wish there was more of it. Ubisoft did lots of research to make sure Eden\u2019s Gate has a believable cult structure, but it\u2019s not explored enough in-game. I wouldn\u2019t even know John Seed was a lawyer if I hadn\u2019t read the information elsewhere. Despite being the main attraction, the bad guys just don\u2019t get enough screen time.

Instead of being set in a fictional approximation of a random third-world country, Far Cry 5 takes place on American soil in Montana. The plot this time around looks to hit fans a lot closer to home, and instead of dealing with a single madman\u2019s antics, you\u2019ve got to face down a whole cult.Hope County, Montana needs a savior, and you\u2019re the only one that fits the bill. As an unnamed deputy sheriff (everyone just calls you \u201cRook\u201d because you\u2019re the rookie cop on the squad) you\u2019ll have to liberate Hope County from the clutches of Joseph Seed\u2019s Project at Eden\u2019s Gate cult. So, most of you who read this are likely dying to find out about the political content. Does Far Cry 5 make a scathing critique of \u201cTrump\u2019s America\u201d and the alt-right, or does it criticize the left?Both sides of the political spectrum are likely frothing at the mouth over the opportunities for \u201chot takes\u201d Far Cry 5 presents, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be plenty of them, regardless of whether there\u2019s anything substantive there to comment on. My take away from it is that any political commentary the game makes is absolutely skin deep, and the only message here is \u201ccults are bad.\u201dJoseph Seed and troupe don\u2019t really fit on the US\u2019s political spectrum, mostly because for all the bickering people here still talk about their problems for the most part. Instead, the Project at Eden\u2019s Gate is like a larger, more violent but less sexually abusive version of the Branch Davidians, with Joseph Seed playing the role of David Koresh.The Project at Eden\u2019s Gate is your typical doomsday cult, but instead of doing a Waco, Joseph and his siblings Jacob, John, and Faith have decided to turn Hope Valley into their own personal little fiefdom. Anyone who doesn\u2019t willingly join the cult is either murdered or forcibly converted through torture or drugs (or both).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ceeba6db-5302-4df8-9bf3-b9b720d3de18": {"__data__": {"id_": "ceeba6db-5302-4df8-9bf3-b9b720d3de18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "0586ef61-c2e3-483b-b269-57abe6c76116", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "acb4550800032349c5767cdfb767ea4c8847d0c21ab8e179a72a9b6d2e295e80"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e0bbd39-deeb-4c57-b772-a9e6211f9b57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b39a3b0c0b8d4c5c01f574acf20e5e2b7fcc71b04ac920a4021017371cb4f3d3"}}, "hash": "27f575b2d35ccfb7fce9b30d26e4f820d70a12f950deb1bfa77993e381769521", "text": "Joseph thinks he has been chosen by God to protect his \u201cchildren\u201d and lead them to Eden\u2019s Gate so that humanity can return to the Garden of Eden.Unfortunately, as intriguing as the background for Far Cry 5 is, the way its narrative structure is set up means much of it is wasted by weird pacing. All open-world games to a certain extent have issues with inspiring a feeling of urgency, and the more open a game is, the more you\u2019ll find the main story taking a back seat to exploration, side quests, and collectibles.Far Cry 5, for better or worse, is the most open game in the series. After a brief tutorial section at the start, the entire game world is unlocked for you. Previous Far Cry games have usually had a \u201cnorthern\u201d and \u201csouthern\u201d section, with one of them blocked until later in the game, but not this one.Hope County is split into three sections, each of them controlled by one of the Seed siblings. John Seed controls Holland Valley; Faith Seed uses the swamps and springs of the Henbane River region to grow the flowers needed to produce her mind-controller BLISS drug; and last, but not least, are the Whitetail Mountains, which are controlled by Jacob Seed and used as a training and staging ground for the Eden\u2019s Gate armed forces.You can take on these three regions in any order or even move between them at will. This is where the narrative issues come into play though. Each region has a \u201cResistance Meter\u201d you have to fill to progress in your attempt to take down one of the siblings. Almost everything you do fills the Resistance Meter a little. Rescuing civilians, taking down large cult outposts, or assisting locals in their story or side missions will all add little chunks to the meter. Once it hits a milestone, you can take on a unique story mission concerning that region\u2019s Seed sibling. Each of these milestone missions builds a narrative that concludes in a showdown with the sibling and the \u201cliberation\u201d of an area.The problem with this kind of story progression though is how uneven the tone of the game becomes. With no way of knowing how you\u2019re going to play through the Far Cry 5, you\u2019ll rarely find any callbacks to game events outside of whatever region they took place in. Even when you\u2019ve just crawled out of the swamps at the beginning of the game, everyone treats you like a hero, and the only permanency that exists in the game comes from taking down the Seed siblings.Even when they\u2019re gone though, regions stay mostly the same. The Eden\u2019s Gate cultists still roam around doing whatever, and the locals will still offer their questlines like nothing happened.There also seems to be some subtext for a, \u201care we as bad as the cultists,\u201d subtext to the story (by \u201cseems to be\u201d I mean that some random NPCs basically ask this question to the air when I walk past them). If the writing was any more subtle, or if the cult wasn\u2019t so completely insane and evil there might be some fruit to that train of thought, but the obvious answer to that question is, \u201cabsolutely not.\u201dThe cultists kidnap, torture, mutilate, brainwash, and murder people with impunity and the fight against them is entirely justified. However, the game continues down this train of thought by having the Seed siblings defending their actions to you and exposing the unfortunate events that happened to them in the past. I won\u2019t ruin it for you, but nothing that happened to them gives any justification for the cult\u2019s actions or what they\u2019ve done in Hope County.I\u2019m not sure if the writers were trying to get you to sympathize with the Seeds with their little monologues or just trying to show how delusional they are, but I just didn\u2019t care. The Seeds are portrayed as too brutal and megalomaniacal to take seriously, and it ended up making the work that went into their personalities and backstories meaningless. A better tack would be to make the whole crew more \u201cbenevolent dictator\u201d and confront the player with a situation in which the Seeds might very well be right or actually trying to do the best for their fellow man. Instead, they\u2019re so clear cut evil that their motivation is irrelevant, and it\u2019s undeniable they\u2019re wrong.The uneven feeling extends throughout the various aspects of the game. I was never sure whether I was supposed to be horrified by what was going on or giggling, or what.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e0bbd39-deeb-4c57-b772-a9e6211f9b57": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e0bbd39-deeb-4c57-b772-a9e6211f9b57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "ceeba6db-5302-4df8-9bf3-b9b720d3de18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "27f575b2d35ccfb7fce9b30d26e4f820d70a12f950deb1bfa77993e381769521"}, "3": {"node_id": "334ddb68-7fee-4cd9-b2df-955f83aa66bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ded12b60f11013e64d6b791e8ae80d577c6c25ab0eb0bdbd73e636ae56fce16b"}}, "hash": "b39a3b0c0b8d4c5c01f574acf20e5e2b7fcc71b04ac920a4021017371cb4f3d3", "text": "Here are some examples of just how jarring the game\u2019s tone is:Far Cry 5 sets itself up to be somewhat of a pseudo-horror game with some of the creepy, violent, sinister stuff the cult does but then injects out of place awkward humor. It\u2019s like one team made the main plot with the Seed family and the cult and they were told to make a horror game, and another group did the dialog for the ordinary citizens and sidekicks and were told the game was a comedy.Luckily, the gameplay is pretty fun. There\u2019s a ton of cars, boats, helicopters, and airplanes to operate, and Hope Country is varied enough geographically to keep boredom from slipping in. There are plenty of side activities to do as well. I enjoyed fishing and hunting for \u201cPrepper\u2019s Stashes,\u201d which are caches of items that usually involve solving a small physical puzzle to access.One thing I ran into was that there was sometimes too much going on. I might be trying to rescue a civillian I found in a van while heading to a Prepper\u2019s Stash when suddenly cultists and Resistance members begin descending onto my position and fighting each other. After we win the firefight, the person I rescued tells me about a cult outpost, and I forget all about what I was doing in the first place.Like the plot though, I wish that the side activities too were more interconnected. Instead it all feels like a bunch of tiny distractions. Even side missions and some story missions just feel completely detached from the rest of the game. They tend to depend too heavily on \u201cgo here and kill this\u201d as well instead of being comprised of unique gameplay experiences.You don\u2019t get a vast arsenal to choose from in the first place. The guns are split among a few categories like Pistols, SMGs, Rifles, Sniper Rifles, and Special Weapons. Unfortunately, there\u2019s only a few to choose from in each class, not counting the prestige weapons that are just unique versions of the base weapons in the game. Ghost Recon Wildlands had a great weapons system and an excellent selection of guns and attachments, and I wish this game were comparable.The choice of firearms represented in this game is also somewhat strange. This is rural Montana, so you would expect a lot of hunting rifles and shotguns. However, for some reason, the most common gun in Hope County is some fictional variant of an AR-15 type rifle called the AR-C that fires in single, burst, and full-auto. How everyone in Hope County got ahold of a modern, full-auto assault rifle is beyond me. Apparently, Montana gun laws are relatively lax, but I\u2019m pretty sure the importation of thousands of fully-automatic rifles would raise some flags somewhere.The guns you think would be more common, bolt-action .308 rifles, .22s, .38s, and so on are rare or non-existent. Instead, you get Uzis, Tech 9s, .50 anti-material rifles, and other guns that are rare in civilian hands. Ubisoft could have used the Montana setting to add a ton of guns we don\u2019t usually see in games, and shy away from the guns-blazing, full-auto rampages we typically see in FPS games, but instead the arsenal is pretty equivalent to what we\u2019ve seen in previous Far Cry games.The gunplay itself in Far Cry 5 is OK most of the time. It suffers from the same syndrome that many FPS games do in that most (if not all) of its firearms feel incredibly anemic. Both when it comes to hunting animals (one of the side activities and a way to get skins to sell) and fighting cultists, most pistols, the SMGs, and lower caliber rifles feel like you\u2019re just shooting puffs of air. More powerful guns like the .50 snipers rifles and the .44 Magnum also feel incredibly underpowered.Not only do the guns not feel powerful in the sound and effect of firing, but they also end up doing much, much less damage than they would in real life. As Far Cry 5 goes on and you face higher ranking cultists, they just become bullet sponges, which takes a lot of the fun out of the game. There\u2019s nothing less immersive than shooting a cougar in the head with a .308 rifle five times and watch it run away.There are microtransactions in Far Cry 5, though I\u2019m not sure why. You can purchase silver bars for real money, or find small amounts in safes scattered throughout Hope County. You can use these silver bars to buy prestige clothing, weapons, and vehicles. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d want to though.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "334ddb68-7fee-4cd9-b2df-955f83aa66bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "334ddb68-7fee-4cd9-b2df-955f83aa66bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e0bbd39-deeb-4c57-b772-a9e6211f9b57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b39a3b0c0b8d4c5c01f574acf20e5e2b7fcc71b04ac920a4021017371cb4f3d3"}, "3": {"node_id": "5f108e3a-6ac8-4d69-8169-81d040ae933f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e70b06c64b7be4d3e1752b73e391f47a185502d47c0a1e4f50085645dc25ea22"}}, "hash": "ded12b60f11013e64d6b791e8ae80d577c6c25ab0eb0bdbd73e636ae56fce16b", "text": "I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d want to though. You can also buy all these things for the in-game currency, and being that, for the most part, they\u2019re just variants of regular items, they\u2019re not even that useful.I suppose microtransactions could give you a boost early in the game, but that\u2019s mainly just taking the fun away from yourself since Far Cry 5 is so single-player/co-op campaign-centric. The whole silver bar system feels very much like an afterthought and I really never thought about it during my entire time through the game. In fact, I never spent the silver bars I found during the course of Far Cry 5 because none of the gaudy prestige items interested me at all.The drop-in multiplayer co-op in Far Cry 5 has been a highly touted feature, and it works well. If there\u2019s one thing Ubisoft has in the bag, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve got some of the best working drop-in multiplayer in the industry. It\u2019s easy to invite a friend to your game, and once there you can both play as usual. You do have to stick pretty closely together, with the host player being the anchor for the player who joins. Roam too far as second banana, and you\u2019ll respawn right back next to the host. However, other than that limitation, you\u2019re free to drive, fly, or shoot just as if you were playing the game single-player.Co-op is one place where the game\u2019s mission structure is a boon. Being able to hit the game in small bites instead of long story bits makes it a lot more convenient for multiplayer. Far Cry 5 lends itself well to being played in quick 20-30 minute chunks, with the mission structure providing plenty of good stopping points. It makes for good co-op, and if you\u2019re someone that doesn\u2019t have a ton of time all at once to complete a\u00a0game, you may appreciate it.Far Cry 5 Arcade is a mode that lets you play user-created maps in solo, co-op, or multiplayer capacities. This game ships with a robust map editor on all platforms that includes assets from Far Cry 4, Far Cry Primal, Far Cry 5, Watch Dogs, Assassin\u2019s Creed Unity, and Assassin\u2019s Creed IV Black Flag. Theoretically, this gives the game unlimited replay value, though the maps present are far smaller than a full-fledged campaign.Since the game hasn\u2019t been released yet, there\u2019s not much available to play yet, but the sample maps did give a taste of what\u2019s possible with the editor. One of the single-player/co-op maps I played was a recreation of a Waterworld atoll (with the possible loadouts referencing The Mariner and The Deacon) with the mission of clearing out enemies. Another simulated a prison break, and I had to fight my way out of the jail to freedom.The PvP multiplayer maps left a bit more to be desired, and I don\u2019t feel like Far Cry 5 is very well geared to deathmatch-style gameplay. However, it really comes down to what the community does with the editor on whether Far Cry 5 Arcade will be good or not. It\u2019s kind of a gamble on whether to buy the game based on this feature. On the one hand, if a lot of people pick it up and start making cool maps, it might be a game you don\u2019t put down for months. However, if people just ignore the editor, you might find yourself just playing the single-player campaign without much of a glance at Far Cry 5 Arcade. Given that map editors are so rare on console games though, Ubisoft gets some kudos for bringing that option to PS4 and Xbox One.This game was all over the place regarding quality. There are some things I really like about Far Cry 5, and others I just think are awful. If the story had been told in a more linear, coherent way I think it would have been much better. This game almost gives you too much freedom to the detriment of cohesive gameplay design. Each thing you do has so little effect on the rest of the game world that it feels futile. The only bonus from this is that it facilitates co-op gameplay well.Part of what made me disappointed in this game was that I bought into the hype train. I thought that the Seeds were going to be a lot more interesting than they really were, and I expected a story that had a unique spin.

The stretch of Montana country is beautiful but racked by tragedy; a region of breathtaking views marred by the violent and vengeful grip of a doomsday cult called Eden\u2019s Gate. That clash of bucolic, frontiersman-like Americana and end-of-days gloom brought on by the cult informs every aspect of Far Cry 5 but also highlights some of its biggest shortcomings.\u00a0Far Cry 5\u2018s opening sequence establishes a dark tone. As the junior deputy on a mission to arrest Joseph Seed, the leader of Eden\u2019s Gate, players arrive at the commune\u2019s base woefully outgunned. Seed stands in his chapel, preaching to those gathered of society\u2019s failings and imminent collapse right up until the moment the deputy places him in handcuffs. It\u2019s a tense few minutes after that, as players escort Seed back to a helicopter as his flock begins to close in. Eden\u2019s Gate is powerful, seemingly unstoppable, and with their leader threatened, it\u2019s no surprise that the cult is quick to action. Members throw themselves onto the helicopter willingly, as if their only purpose in life was that single action, and send it hurtling to the ground. Before long, Seed is free, and the deputy takes up arms to stop the cult once and for all.Far Cry 5\u00a0(PC, Xbox One, PS4 [reviewed])Developer: Ubisoft MontrealPublisher: UbisoftReleased: March 27, 2018MSRP: $59.99Although Far Cry 5\u2018s first hour conveys a sense of urgency, it quickly falls in line with the series\u2019 established framework. Hope County is a playground dressed up as an inviting, albeit chaotic, environment. The ongoing threat of Eden\u2019s Gate always looms overhead \u2014 it\u2019s hard to go a few minutes without running into a dozen armed cultists \u2014 but players can distract themselves by fishing, hunting, and exploring the map just as easily as they can work towards taking Seed and his family down. There\u2019s plenty to do, and while Montana might not sound like the most exotic or exciting location on paper, there\u2019s even more to see.But by throwing players into an open-world sandbox, Far Cry 5 casts its narrative direction by the wayside. Although your goal is to kill Seed\u2019s three generals (one in each of Hope County\u2019s different biomes) before capturing the cult leader, the storytelling quickly takes a backseat.The game\u2019s more interested in joking about Seed\u2019s man bun than exploring Eden\u2019s Gate with a critical eye, opting to paint the cult in broad strokes as a group of vague zealots and torturers than an organization built on the backs of broken people. And while the scattershot storytelling doesn\u2019t make the game any less fun to play, it makes for an experience that feels toothless rather fast \u2014 Seed and his lot are easier to understand as cartoonish villains spouting rhetoric than characters capable of complexity, all the way up to the game\u2019s final cutscene.Fortunately, Eden\u2019s Gate cultists aren\u2019t the only people you\u2019ll meet in Far Cry 5. Hope County is also home to a small grassroots collection of rebels and freedom fighters. Among them are nine (six humans, two wild animals, and one Very Good Boy) characters who can accompany The Deputy into the wilderness and provide support. Each one of the partners has a unique set of skills that complement varying playstyles, like Nick Rye, who uses his agile plane to strafe and divebomb enemies. AI buddies often get a bad rap, but they\u2019re mostly all useful here, especially considering that Far Cry 5 isn\u2019t afraid to overwhelm players at any given moment.\u00a0And though it\u2019s not uncommon to be up against a dozen foes at once, firefights are where Far Cry 5\u2018s sandbox structure shines. During both main story missions and open-ended play, Eden\u2019s Gate cultists have a bad habit of fighting dirty. They\u2019re armed to the teeth and unafraid of calling in reinforcements, be it waves of fresh fighters or aerial support. Even with a partner or two, surviving large-scale fights isn\u2019t a guarantee.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c43275c3-7b10-4d8b-a877-0c259a7e3e71": {"__data__": {"id_": "c43275c3-7b10-4d8b-a877-0c259a7e3e71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f108e3a-6ac8-4d69-8169-81d040ae933f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e70b06c64b7be4d3e1752b73e391f47a185502d47c0a1e4f50085645dc25ea22"}, "3": {"node_id": "d51c3cfd-c6cb-44cd-ae97-35761cca88a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b91a1ac129a671ca540f407ebb9ff42f400add6e84eaae65b6d1213597064a4"}}, "hash": "1132c820611fa13da372cf775f401d03f75bdf1ca6da44b2d83536416e99aa82", "text": "Even with a partner or two, surviving large-scale fights isn\u2019t a guarantee. It\u2019s best to prepare before assaulting a cult outpost, though even the stealthiest approach tends to go tits up, leading to shootouts full of explosions, near-death escapes, and absurdly high body counts. Gunplay in Far Cry 5 is feverish and enjoyable, with customization and a steadily unlockable arsenal that allows players to mix up engagements however they see fit.There\u2019s something deeply satisfying about approaching a guarded camp with a recurve bow and silently picking off enemy snipers. There\u2019s something cathartic about tossing remote-controlled explosives at a cult VIP and rushing in with a shotgun to clean up anyone left standing. But there\u2019s nothing better than starting a gunfight and reacting with fury in the form of a few well-placed headshots. Violence is Far Cry 5\u2018s primary language, and if nothing else, the game speaks it well.With so much combat, it\u2019s only natural to seek some quiet respite. Hope County, with its mix of forested mountains and rolling rivers, offers plenty of pretty scenery to soak in. It\u2019s hard not to be impressed by the environments, which balance the beauty and brutality of the American wilderness in a way that few games have before. Reaching the summit of a steep peak, tracking down a doomsday prepper\u2019s long-forgotten supply stash in an underground bunker, and wandering through a park dedicated to prehistoric mammoths are just a few of the poignant, quiet moments that make Far Cry 5 worthwhile when the shooting stops. It\u2019s possible (and recommended) to take a break from the action, turn off the game\u2019s HUD, and wander around in the woods for a while. That Far Cry 5 lacks a photo mode is a crime.Far Cry 5 is a solid first-person shooter set in a vibrant, breathtaking location. It plays well, looks great, and is packed with enough content to keep players invested in Hope County for a good, long while. Though Joseph Seed and Eden\u2019s Gate work better in theory than in practice, the Montana-based doomsday cult marks a departure for the franchise that pays off.[This review is based on a retail version of the game provided by the publisher and pertains to the core single-player story.

The story is preposterous. The gameplay is brilliant.As a born-and-bred Montanan, I find the portrayal of Montana beautifully ludicrous. I certainly don't remember quite so many Southern accents up there in the Northwestern mountains and prairies---Montana accents can range from pretty standard West Coast American to something a bit more Midwestern/Great Lakes-ish, but I suppose there's some hillbilly in there, too---and the state is overall much less racially diverse than Far Cry 5, though it has many more Native Americans than are represented in\u00a0the game.One must choke down their suspension of disbelief to accept the game's premise. Yes, there have been cults and militias in America and they have presented difficulties to law enforcement and some of these cults have ended in violence and bloodshed.\u00a0But we're talking about a cult thousands strong, armed with fighter planes and rocket launchers. The cult has taken total control of an entire county, stealing property, murdering or enslaving innocents and running roughshod over this rural American county like the Taliban in Afghanistan.No, this is not likely to happen\u00a0in the US. Long before it could ever get this bad the feds would crack down. If it did somehow get this bad, the army would intervene. It's just not at all realistic---but who cares?\u00a0This is Far Cry.\u00a0I played the game imagining this was an alternate version of America, one with even more brittle institutions and a very weak federal government. One without cell phones, for that matter. One in which Eden's Gate could actually take over and nobody would come to help. Nobody but the Rookie, that is. I mean, why not just enjoy the fantasy, however absurd, rather than worry about how unrealistic this game in a deeply unrealistic series is? If I can accept this twisted version of the my home state, so can you...Thi s is my Rookie. I gave him a mullet, made him Native, and dressed him up like a true Montanan.Fun Times In BabylonThe open-world of Hope County, Montana is a sight to behold. Whatever the game lacks in story it makes up for in adventure, variety and gameplay. When a co-worker emailed me the other day to ask how I was liking the game, I simply wrote back: \"I love it to pieces.\"This is certainly the best\u00a0Far Cry\u00a0since\u00a0Far Cry 3,\u00a0but in many ways I'm enjoying it even more. For one thing, it's just a lot of fun. I know that's not a particularly deep observation, but it's the truth. I've been playing the hell out of this game and I've been having a blast the entire time. I'll tell a few stories to help illustrate my point.During one story mission, I went to steal a plane for one of the main NPC characters, Nick Rye. Completing this mission unlocks\u00a0Rye\u00a0as a gun for hire. He'll fly the skies and take out enemy planes for you, freeing you up to wreak havoc on the ground unmolested.The plane was located at John Seed's ranch. John is one of the top lieutenants of the cult, managing one of three major sections of the map for his brother Joseph\u00a0Seed, the Father. (The other two sections are controlled by Jacob and Faith Seed.) When I show up, I discover that the ranch is also one of the cult's outposts. Like in past\u00a0Far Cry\u00a0games, capturing these bases is one of the main activities in the game. So I decide to forego the plane mission and take the base. I start out pretty sneaky but give up part way through to destroy the final of three alarms with a rocket launcher. All hell breaks loose and I barely manage to take out the remaining bad guys, accidentally lighting myself on fire with my flamethrower. My NPC companion revives me and I finish off the final cultist with a rocket that sends him flying fifty feet into the air. You can watch this all in the video below:Another time I was running through the forest when I came upon a small campground.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39f932e6-7ca9-49d6-ae36-d20687f80719": {"__data__": {"id_": "39f932e6-7ca9-49d6-ae36-d20687f80719", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "d51c3cfd-c6cb-44cd-ae97-35761cca88a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5b91a1ac129a671ca540f407ebb9ff42f400add6e84eaae65b6d1213597064a4"}, "3": {"node_id": "7eee7beb-8439-4ef6-9852-7eed66af8ec0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bea819c7557adc22e836dba9d80c5f69599226dc43a24863b6b745a71a569677"}}, "hash": "2d0b77a4f07e5fed8f0d041cf9cec692daa6970487fa18b22d0b628aac9f9717", "text": "A man was seated playing a Bob Dylan song. A man and a woman stood dancing by the fire. It's little moments like this that really make the game feel alive---or at least more alive than many similar games.Tonal DissonanceThe FatherThere's also the quest I went on to retrieve bull testicles for the annual Testicle Festival. Or the one where I helped a conspiracy theorist straight out of the X-Files build a teleportation device that actually worked, leaving me with a snazzy new weapon in the process.These are coupled with missions where we learn about the atrocities of various cult members, including one cultist who made starving children eat their own parents after burning them alive. These tonal pivots are extreme, no doubt about it, but this is what we've come to expect from\u00a0Far Cry\u00a0as a series. Extreme violence, madness and cruelty are juxtaposed with humor and bombast. It's a far cry from realistic, but as a game it still somehow works.I've seen some people complain that the game doesn't send a clear enough political message or that its shifting tone is hard to follow, but I think this is what makes this series tick. Contradictions are at the heart of\u00a0Far Cry\u00a0and now those contradictions are\u00a0just much closer to home.Many people have also complained that\u00a0Far Cry 5's\u00a0political and social commentary is too watered-down and too vague to be of any particular consequence. It's not relevant to modern-day America or strident enough in its condemnation of things certain people feel the need to condemn. The cult's belief system is opaque and barely touches on radical Christianity or radical conservatism or what have you. And it's true: This isn't a condemnation of ultra right-wingers, though I do think it's a critique of radical beliefs in general. The cult may be impossible to pin down due to Ubisoft playing it safe with the religion and politics, but I think the point is that Eden's Gate is emblematic of all kinds of radical, violent extremism. It's not like radical Islam or rightwing terror groups make any sense, either.But this certainly isn't a condemnation of conservatism. Indeed, most of the good guys are red-blooded Americans wearing flags on their T-shirts. I've never seen so many American flag shirts in my life. But I do think the game has a message, even if it's one that isn't all that applicable to the here and now of US or Montana politics.Far Cry 5 evoking True Detective.Scottish political philosopher Edmund Burke\u00a0famously wrote that \u201cThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201dHe also wrote, \"No man, who is not inflamed by vain-glory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single, unsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours, are of power to defeat the subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens. When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\"I think this pretty perfectly sums up what this game is all about. Good citizens stood around and did nothing while bad men and women took control of their home. It may seem silly in the context of modern America with all our checks and balances and power and wealth, but this sort of thing is far from unprecedented. I mentioned the Taliban above. Eden's Gate is like a very generic American Taliban. The citizens of Hope County let them take over and then finally, with the help of one super soldier (young Rookie) fought back. The only thing necessary for Joseph Seed to take over was for good men to do nothing, and in the end \"the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\"Indeed, one wouldn't have to look all that closely at current happenings in Washington, D.C. to see some parallels. Even our illustrious Republic and its Constitution are not immune to corruption, to 'united cabals of ambitious citizens.' Good people of every political stripe need to stand up to political corruption, warmongering and nepotism at all levels of government.\u00a0There's even one mission in the game that's all about gerrymandering...Changes to the FormulaFar Cry 5's Montana is truly beautiful, just like the real thing.Far Cry 5\u00a0makes some solid gameplay and quality of life improvements as well. Gone are the silly towers that you once had to climb in order to unlock portions of the map. \"I know what you're thinking,\" your first quest-giver tells you as he asks you to climb the radio tower. \"Don't worry, I'm not going to make you climb towers all over the county.\"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7eee7beb-8439-4ef6-9852-7eed66af8ec0": {"__data__": {"id_": "7eee7beb-8439-4ef6-9852-7eed66af8ec0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "39f932e6-7ca9-49d6-ae36-d20687f80719", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2d0b77a4f07e5fed8f0d041cf9cec692daa6970487fa18b22d0b628aac9f9717"}, "3": {"node_id": "31650381-39b9-44a3-8b67-6c48c95c9973", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5eacd5ea3de8b4bb77a0ac6909fc7ae531396c80b3546dfc39954ad02bfa7774"}}, "hash": "bea819c7557adc22e836dba9d80c5f69599226dc43a24863b6b745a71a569677", "text": "\"Don't worry, I'm not going to make you climb towers all over the county.\" Now you just find maps which you can later sell for cash.Gone are the multiple health bars, also. Now you just have one. You can use medkits to heal, but over time you'll heal without them. Gone, too, is the constant picking of flowers. The only potions you craft are totally optional. Medkits have to be purchased or found. Pickable flowers are far more rare. And with all these omissions, tedium is also vastly diminished.Gone, too, is the requirement to hunt and skin animals to progress. You can still do that and earn rewards for it, including useful bait and valuable skins, but you don't need to seek out specific animals in order to level up your pouches and gear. Now everything is based on \"perks\" which you can earn by doing...well, just about everything. Get ten kills with this weapon, get a perk. Get five kills with that weapon, get a perk. Go base-jumping, get two perks. Crash your plane, get a perk. Then use all these perks to level up your various skills.If you want to just go out in search of perks, there are myriad 'prepper' stashes dotted across the map. Each one is a mini-puzzle of sorts that requires you to figure out how to get inside and find the treasure---money, goods and three perk magazines that give you one perk each. This means that pretty much no matter how you play, you'll be earning perks as you go. You can even go and see what activities will earn you perks and do those---for instance, changing up which weapons you use is a sure way to earn perks faster and get you trying out different guns.But really, you can just play and not even think about it. You'll earn perks and level up at a nice pace regardless.A familiar face.Missions, meanwhile, flow much more organically than in previous games. Pretty much everyone in the game has something to offer. Rescue a citizen on the side of the road, maybe they'll tip you off to some side mission or character you need to meet. Capture a base and you'll almost certainly have a side mission, a prepper stash tip and possibly a story mission open up. You can do these in just about any order you like, though obviously certain story missions need to be done before others open up.Ubisoft has certainly taken some of what they implemented in\u00a0Ghost Recon: Wildlands\u00a0and applied it here. The format of the map\u00a0is incredibly similar, and as with\u00a0Wildlands\u00a0you'll need to keep provoking the boss of each section into action. Poke the bee's nest enough and the cult will stir into action against you, eventually leading you closer and closer to each of your primary targets. The whole thing can play out in any order, and you can spend as much time on side missions and other side content as you like in the process, or just race through the game.Online/ArcadeThe game is fully playable in online co-op which is another nice feature for anyone wanting to delve in with a friend. Meanwhile, the online portion of the game takes place in\u00a0Far Cry Arcade,\u00a0where you can play solo, co-op or PvP depending on the maps you choose. The Arcade is also a really full-featured map editor which I haven't played with at all yet. I've played some of the Arcade maps, but mostly spent my time in the sprawling campaign.One clever twist here is that to access the Arcade you actually have to go to arcade machines dotted about Hope County. It's a nice touch. I'll play around with the map editor and all of this more and write it up in a future post.Good doggie.Micro-TransactionsMicro-transactions in full-priced video games with paid DLC are bad. Plain and simple. All these big AAA games with loot boxes just smack of greed. But at least in\u00a0Far Cry 5\u00a0the MTX don't have an impact on the game itself. Basically you can use real money to purchase silver bars (which you can find in the game also) which you can then use to buy gear in shops. You can also just spend in-game cash on these same items. None of them have any impact on gameplay. You can also purchase outfits with silver bars or in-game cash. That's it, basically. You can just ignore these altogether or spend some cash on items if you really have to. No loot boxes, nothing on offer that you can't just buy after playing the game.VerdictFar Cry 5\u00a0isn't a perfect game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31650381-39b9-44a3-8b67-6c48c95c9973": {"__data__": {"id_": "31650381-39b9-44a3-8b67-6c48c95c9973", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "7eee7beb-8439-4ef6-9852-7eed66af8ec0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bea819c7557adc22e836dba9d80c5f69599226dc43a24863b6b745a71a569677"}, "3": {"node_id": "776f1cf5-120d-41ec-9f24-9f7572f8a074", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "79ba49a6df4f601ca688cc638c98c9a9e676e88df0a97eba19d513873dda35f5"}}, "hash": "5eacd5ea3de8b4bb77a0ac6909fc7ae531396c80b3546dfc39954ad02bfa7774", "text": "Some missions are certainly less fun than others. I encountered a couple difficulty spikes that had me more frustrated than challenged. The sheer scope of content can be a bit bewildering and overwhelming at times. And the lack of a clear message certainly indicates that Ubisoft was not willing, not brave enough perhaps, to take more of a stand.And yet, for all that, this is some of the most fun I've had gaming all year. The game is gorgeous and rich with content. There's tons to do and you can do it however you like. Scale a mountain and go base-jumping with your squirrel suit. Try to crash your plane into an enemy outpost. Unleash predators on unsuspecting cultists. Blow stuff up with glee and abandon. Pet your adorable dog, Boomer. This freedom, coupled with the game's excellent quality of life changes, make this a wonderful first-person shooter sandbox game that will appeal to anyone who enjoys freedom in gameplay and doesn't mind an outrageous story.Of course, I have my own biases. I've loved every\u00a0Far Cry\u00a0game including the original (though Primal\u00a0was a bit weaker, and I didn't play that much of\u00a0Far Cry 2. It's on my list of games to return to and play more thoroughly.) These games just click for me---they don't for everyone. I'm glad to see the series make some changes, also.\u00a0Far Cry 3\u00a0was great, but\u00a0Far Cry 4\u00a0didn't try to differentiate itself enough and that made it feel a bit too repetitive.\u00a0Far Cry 5\u00a0is certainly more of the same thing, but with enough changes that it feels fresh.I give the game a\u00a0Buy\u00a0on my Buy/Hold/Sell scale. I think it's worth the price of admission. If you get the\u00a0Gold version you get a copy of the remastered version of\u00a0Far Cry 3\u00a0as well, which is a great deal (though I haven't yet played the remaster so I can't comment on its quality.)I played my copy of the game on a PS4 Pro on both a TV supporting HDR and one without HDR. The game is stunning on my LG OLED screen with HDR but looks quite nice on a regular 4K television as well.Far Cry 5TL;DR:\u00a0Far Cry 5 is a chaos simulator with a preposterous story, tons of quality of life improvements over past games and an enormous amount of content. It's a blast if you let yourself just accept the silly premise and not invest too much in the politics of the game, or lack thereof.Developer:\u00a0UbisoftPlatforms:\u00a0PS4, Xbox One, PCPublisher:\u00a0UbisoftRelease Date: March 27th, 2018Price: $59.99 / $30 Season Pass / $89.99 Gold w/Season PassScore:\u00a09/10A review code was provided for the purpose of this review.And here's some more gameplay footage for your viewing pleasure:\nShacknews, New to Shacknews?

Login NowFar Cry 5 surprised me in a lot of ways, some pleasant and others not so much.By the time my law enforcement colleagues and I arrived to take The Father, Joseph Seed, into custody, Hope County, Montana, had been consumed by his Eden\u2019s Gate followers, known to the locals as Peggies. The situation was dire, and I felt a chill the first time I saw his compound. The Father, the game\u2019s main antagonist, reminded me of David Koresh, who was the leader of the real-world Branch Davidians. It was a narrative tone that I wasn\u2019t expecting, but it was welcome. Soon, however, the unsettling mood set by the prologue gave way to the fast-paced, non-stop action that open-world Ubisoft games are known for.When I was eventually set free in Hope County, I spent about half an hour being introduced to the various concepts and mechanics of Far Cry 5. I found a prepper stash, had the chance to swim, used a zipline, and even hired an NPC to help clear the game\u2019s first region, Dutch\u2019s Island. Once through that, I was free to go where I wanted and do what I pleased.After clearing Dutch\u2019s Island, I picked up a quest to liberate a lumber mill, so I set off on foot with my hired NPC fighter in tow. I generally don\u2019t like to fast travel in open world games, but I didn\u2019t even drive to this mission. My immediate goal was to get a feel for Hope County. It looked gorgeous on my PC in 2K, and I wanted to get lost wandering around the woods and mountains.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "776f1cf5-120d-41ec-9f24-9f7572f8a074": {"__data__": {"id_": "776f1cf5-120d-41ec-9f24-9f7572f8a074", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "31650381-39b9-44a3-8b67-6c48c95c9973", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5eacd5ea3de8b4bb77a0ac6909fc7ae531396c80b3546dfc39954ad02bfa7774"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e030150-aa91-4f5d-893a-871756dc515f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b80be497a3a96f6a30a34141b285e04a7e7ec97cf5f2726915e8e7b87b5d38f1"}}, "hash": "79ba49a6df4f601ca688cc638c98c9a9e676e88df0a97eba19d513873dda35f5", "text": "The first thing I noticed beyond the beauty of Hope County were the sounds that brought the world to life. Be it the burst fire from assault weapons over the hill, the creepy voice of a cultist over the radio, or the hissing of a snake\u00a0I couldn't see but knew was close, sound was as essential to survival in Far Cry 5 as it was to my enjoyment in the game.Unfortunately, the temptation to enjoy outdoor life in Far Cry 5\u2019s stunning environment was contradicted by the density of the game\u2019s dangers. I couldn\u2019t go five feet without being fired on by Eden\u2019s Gate, or mauled by a bear. This sometimes lead to hilarity, but there were few, if any, quiet moments in the early going where I could stop and enjoy the world. My first attempt to go fishing was met with violence, and hunting isn\u2019t really hunting when you need an automatic rifle to defend yourself from your intended prey. I used both activities almost exclusively to earn money in the early going, but eventually I was swimming in cash and had no gameplay incentive to return to either.The lumber mill mission also turned out to be my first outpost, and those generally worked the same as they did in Far Cry Primal. Each one had numerous enemies, an alarm or two that needed disabling, and some loot and lore could be found once the baddies were gone. Liberating these outposts gave control of it back to the non-cultist citizens and opened it up as a base that I could operate out of. There was always a shop to buy guns, ammo, and items, and usually a vehicle bay or two. Liberating an outpost also presented additional side missions and allowed me to hire wandering NPCs to fight by my side.I enjoyed everything about outposts in Far Cry 5. The fighter I hired on Dutch\u2019s Island helped me clear the first one, and I was pleased to see that I could give him orders with a single button press. If I tagged an enemy and then sent my fighter after them, he\u2019d try to use stealth to take them out. We cleared the first outpost without being detected, and it was nice to see that the area was now back in the hands of the good folks of Hope County. The more outposts and locations I cleared, the less influence Eden\u2019s Gate had, which led to a true feeling that I had liberated the region.As satisfying as clearing an outpost was, though, a major mechanic was missing. Far Cry 5 doesn\u2019t have the option to go prone, and it worsened my experience with stealth gameplay. Ubisoft perfected going prone in Ghost Recon Wildlands and Rainbow Six Siege, and I think that made the lack of a prone mechanic here sting even more. I realize it wasn\u2019t an option in previous Far Cry games, but I don\u2019t get the design decision.Prone notwithstanding, combat was enjoyable. I used a DualShock 4 controller even though I was on PC, and I never took issue with the button layouts, even with vehicles. The control scheme always felt intuitive, and this helped to keep the flow of combat moving. I was never fumbling around trying to figure out what to press. Switching weapons and tossing explosives was effortless, and all of this tied into the weapons and perks in Far Cry 5.Getting weapons and gear in Far Cry 5 wasn\u2019t satisfying. Beyond the\u00a0Compound Bow I found during my time on Dutch\u2019s Island, everything was purchased through vendors. I felt robbed of the need to look for a sniper rifle or assault rifle. Gear acquisition became boring. Some weapon upgrades were locked behind progression, which was fine, but for the most part I found the system unrewarding. Even finding the bow was less exciting once I realized I could have just paid for it.Perks also fell a bit flat for me. There were a few that were useful, such as the Grappling Hook or Lockpick, but beyond that most were forgettable. When I finally finished with everything I wanted to do I was only missing a couple, and I didn\u2019t bother to read their descriptions before spending the points to unlock them.Earning the points to unlock the perks was the best part of the system for me. Perk magazines (each worth one perk point) could be found in prepper stashes and unlocked through gameplay. The few times I needed a perk I knew I could quickly earn the required points by catching a new fish or using a weapon I\u2019d been ignoring. Perk points were also awarded for kills that fighter and specialist companions racked up, which pushed me to give each one a try.Fighters and specialists enhanced the combat experience of Far Cry 5.

They each come with two unknown perks that are revealed and unlocked after they get a certain number of kills. They can be hired or let go as desired, and you can have three on your roster at any one time. I ended up with two I found useful, but the third spot became a revolving door of fighters who didn\u2019t fit in. Since I could mix and match specialists and fighters, and can only ever bring two at a time, this wasn\u2019t a huge deal.The nine specialists were all unique characters that unlocked after the completion of their related mission. Each comes with different perks and personalities, and it\u2019s when they start to interact with each other that things got fun. Nick would compliment Jess, while Hurk would tell her stories and call her \u201clady girl\u201d constantly. Jess would insult Hurk. These interactions were a subtle touch, but they made me want to try different combinations of specialists to see what crazy things they might say to each other. My favorite was when Nick and Jess would be tagging along, and because Jess favored the use of a bow, Nick would chime in with, \u201cI tried hunting with a bow once. That shit\u2019s hard.\u201dThe main appeal of a companion was the violence they brought to the table. In the early hours of my playthrough I would take Jess and Boomer with me. Boomer (the dog) would mark enemies, and Jess (killer with a Compound Bow) would take them out silently. It worked well with my preference for stealth, and it was also effective for hunting wildlife. Slowly, though, I found myself preferring to travel Hope County by helicopter. I grew tired of violent encounters every few steps and used air travel to avoid distraction. This is about when I switched to Nick and Adelaide as companions. Nick flew a plane and could strafe or drop bombs, and Adelaide provided the comedic tone and overwatch in her chopper. Together, we decimated Peggies and could clear outposts and missions in minutes. This built up the resistance in each region and progressed the story at a good pace.The concept of clearing out Peggies and building a resistance in each region worked well. What didn\u2019t work was how often Far Cry 5 interrupted me and dragged me into a story mission. The moment I would level my resistance in an area, one of the Seed siblings would capture me, ripping me from whatever I was doing. Once I could handle, but this occurred half a dozen times. It annoyed me enough that I logged out after leveling my resistance one night. I was exploring prepper stashes and had no desire to be dragged into another mission at that moment, so I put the game down in frustration.It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t find myself invested in the narrative, but collectibles and getting into\u00a0prepper stashes were my favorite parts of Far Cry 5. Prepper stashes were usually bunkers that required me to solve a small puzzle to gain access. I was addicted to these from the moment I realized they existed and managed to find each prepper stash long before beating the game. My only issue was the use of waypoints everywhere. There was one prepper stash that gave me a waypoint that said \u201cFind.\u201d That sort of sucked the fun out of things. I did discover that I could tweak the HUD and gameplay settings, but this was long after it would have helped me.Some prepper stashes, bunkers, and buildings in Far Cry 5 reminded me a bit of Fallout 4. In that game, each destination told a story that I could easily overlook if I wasn\u2019t taking my time. Far Cry 5 had the same feel at times, which is the highest compliment I could give it considering how much I enjoyed Fallout 4. I\u2019d often find that, when I slowed myself down and really paid attention, there were stories being told in Hope County that I could have just as easily walked right past. Hope County was full of lore, but I often found myself too busy ticking the boxes on the waypoint checklist to notice.Far Cry Arcade was the last mode I tried. I loved the idea of designing single player, co-op, and PvP experiences with assets from previous Ubisoft games. However, I was quickly overwhelmed with what was before me and lost interest in building anything. This was more a reflection of my lack of creativity, though. The concept of building new gameplay levels and scenarios by using thousands of assets is interesting, and it could add longevity to Far Cry 5.Next, I jumped into some Far Cry Arcade PvP.

Weapon loadouts were limited, the gameplay didn\u2019t stand out from anything I\u2019d played in the past, and I couldn\u2019t find a reason to want to return. It could have been fun with friends and chatting on the mic together, but I played with random gamers. Nothing about the PvP experience sold me on coming back to it. PvP just doesn\u2019t interest me much these days, and nothing in my rounds of PvP threatened to pull me back to it. I\u2019m a co-op man at heart, which brings me to my biggest complaint.Co-op in Far Cry 5 was amazing to play but terribly implemented. I loved playing with a friend and seeing how combat evolved. I recall cruising down the road, him driving and me hanging out the window with a baseball bat, crushing the face of anything that got close. It was mailbox baseball with a twist, but the fun in co-op never stopped as long as we were insane enough to try something.The problem was when I left his game and returned to my own. I kept my perks, cash, and weapons, but story progression was lost. We probably went through a dozen missions, only for me to return to my game and have to do them all again. How this slipped by the game\u2019s designers or was considered a good idea is beyond me. Co-op was the single most anticipated feature for me leading up to Far Cry 5, but I began avoiding it because I didn\u2019t want to repeat quests in my own instance.Far Cry 5 was a good game that could have been great. Had Ubisoft not been so concerned with holding my hand, or overwhelming me with clutter to keep me from getting bored, Hope County would have gone down as one of the better open worlds I\u2019ve stepped foot in. The\u00a0 game\u2019s narrative was a great idea that turned out better than I expected, but the value for me with an open world will always be in how much I enjoy existing in it. How motivated am I to explore and discover? With Far Cry 5, there were hints of that, but all too often I was shown the answers. This left me feeling slightly robbed of how I experienced things.At the same time, Far Cry 5 met all my expectations for exciting combat and hilarious moments. Whether grappling from my helicopter because a random NPC jacked it, or hearing Adelaide discuss why she stocked up on olive oil before Eden\u2019s Gate took over, there were more moments of hilarity and brilliance than not. A few things missed the mark that shouldn\u2019t have, but I generally got what I expected from Far Cry 5; a fun, open-world game worth the price tag and not to be taken too seriously.Bill, who is also known as Rumpo, is a lifelong gamer and Toronto Maple Leafs fan.

Did I turn that off or something, because I don't recall any of thatI started the game by turning all hud options off, then quickly turned it back on, maybe doing that turned off a tutorial?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI'm with you on a lot of the lack of progression and discovery when it comes to mechanics.  After the first few hours you never find new weapons, you only buy them, and there are few upgrades or even significant variations within a category.\t\t\t\t\nVG247, Ever since Far Cry 3, Ubisoft\u2019s open-world series has been about the bad guys.  These charismatic antagonists take top billing on the box art, and they taunt you across the entire adventure. Next to your protagonist  - who\u2019s usually as likeable as a men\u2019s rights activist - they bleed personality.Far Cry 5 takes this formula to its natural conclusion: now there are four antagonists and the main character is a fully customisable mute. Hooray! As an unnamed deputy, you head to Hope County, Montana, to arrest an enigmatic cult leader known as Joseph Seed. The Seed family run a religious group called the Project at Eden\u2019s Gate and have laid siege to rural America, rounding up civilians, torturing, and maiming - all in the name of God. Hallelujah. Of course, the arrest goes awry, fulfilling a prophecy Joseph predicted and embedding the cult\u2019s beliefs - martyring Joseph without killing him. Radio contact is cut off from the outside world, you are alone, and Hope County has completed its transformation into Fascist Fields.  \n \nHope County is split into three regions - the Henbane River, Holland Valley, and Whitetail Mountains - and each of these regions is overseen by one of Joseph\u2019s trusted advisors: John Seed lords over Holland Valley, Faith Seed enraptures the Henbane River region, and Jacob Seed instills fear into the people of Whitetail Mountains. \" Weapons have a real impact to them, and guns recoil like a bucking bull - every shot is angry and physical.\"Each of the Eden\u2019s Gate leaders has their own methods: John Seed is the cult\u2019s lawyer and rules by intimidation, Faith Seed controls the population through a drug called Bliss, and Jacob Seed recruits frontline soldiers by culling the weak. Only you and your star-spangled assault rifle, your canine companion, a couple of bears, a cougar, resistance fighters, your wingsuit, some air support, a garage full of vehicles, a flamethrower, a bow, lots of explosives, and a combine harvester can stop them. These multiple antagonists represent a structural shift for Far Cry 5. On the tutorial island, an NPC asks you to climb a radio tower. When you reach the peak, he explains that you don\u2019t need to worry - he won\u2019t have you climbing towers all over Montana.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08846006-a8b7-4aa8-9519-982a894624dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "08846006-a8b7-4aa8-9519-982a894624dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "f962e12a-0257-4c82-ad38-01fcc3fb93bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "17eb787a1b2bf5ba137edc76a393c5a9b14344bb1130b831ff23356b464aee1c"}, "3": {"node_id": "aee5539d-9273-4540-b276-3f71c2c71153", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5fbba4ad24dfd8ca70a1d327b67482a2f73f60f700a01a4fdf71a149013da274"}}, "hash": "51c6ba9a9348de4c4ba131733dc122a7d998f897d3a33d7c150a7fd3f9bea50d", "text": "Instead of unlocking the world by clambering up vantage points, you discover points of interest by simply exploring: drive past a cult outpost and it will be on your map forever; talk to a rescued civilian and they might point you to a sidequest; free companions and they will offer up more activities. Far Cry 5 is still as stuffed with things to do as other Ubisoft games, but it never feels overwhelming because of the way it unfurls. There are no progress gates, and you can spread your time between the three regions as you wish. Everything you do - be it stealing a fuel truck, burning a Bliss field, saving citizens, doing side missions, or taking on one of the more lengthy story quests - it all feeds into a progress bar for the antagonist of that region.  \n \nEach of the Seeds must be drawn out by messing with their operations, every third of the bar triggering a big story mission. When I played Far Cry 5 at preview, I wasn\u2019t sold on this structure. It felt confusing and I ended up doing a lot of the filler missions instead of getting to the meat during my short playtime. In the context of the full game, however, it works - even if it can be a bit grindy as you slowly plug away at filling the final third of each bar.Mission quality varies, but the good outweighs the bad. Stealing bull testicles as Marvin Gaye\u2019s Sexual Healing plays over the action is a highlight. Fighting a demon moose who has been pumped full of drugs is not. Luckily, the core of the game feels stronger than ever. Weapons have a real impact to them, and guns recoil like a bucking bull - every shot is angry and physical. There\u2019s just enough auto-aim snap on console to make you feel like a sharpshooter as well, whether you are flipping between targets in an outpost or sailing down a zipline with an uzi, gunning down cultists as you go. Likewise, vehicles feel great to drive. You can get behind the wheel of a big rig and smash through roadblocks, or you can speed across dirt roads in a muscle car, its back-end fishtailing angrily with every push of the accelerator. Once you are done with the roads, you can take to the skies in helicopters and aeroplanes, strafing compounds and performing bombing runs. Or you can jetski and boat across the Henbane River.  \n \nAll three regions have their own distinct personality, too. For example, the Henbane River region is difficult to traverse by car because it\u2019s so hilly and the river itself divides the landmasses like a liquid artery. Take to the air and it comes into its own. Holland Valley, meanwhile, is best explored on four wheels, smashing through fields and barreling into cows. The unpredictability of the world keeps things fresh. \"There are some surprising bits of social commentary nestled in among the stereotypical hillbillies, survivalists, righteous priests, and alien hunters.\"Spreading fire is as much a part of Far Cry\u2019s identity as bad guys gurning into the camera, because fire is indiscriminate. Far Cry smashes loads of components together, placing warring factions, animals, and the elements into the map and letting you manipulate them all. Far Cry 5 hasn\u2019t done much to improve the series here - other than let you play the entire thing with a co-op buddy, upping the unpredictability - but watching your plans unfold as you become the AI puppetmaster is as intoxicating as ever. At least until you are almost murdered by a turkey. Tonally, Far Cry 5 is a strange game. There is no getting away from the real world climate it released in. Here you are, saving the northwestern US from a cult of Christian extremists, diplomacy fails within the first five minutes, and the only answer to all of your problems is a gun.  \n \nIn the lead up to release, Ubisoft made it clear that Far Cry 5 had no political statement to make, but there is no escaping the context it released in. Despite those apolitical claims, some of the dialogue is overtly political, too, though probably not in the way you might expect. At one point, one of the cult leaders breaks into a monologue about their motives, asking you if you\u2019ve seen the way the world is, if you\u2019ve seen who is in charge, if you\u2019ve seen the wars, if you have seen the walls being erected. Far Cry 5 does have a message, and that message appears to be: the world has gone to shit, and people act desperate when pushed, particularly if they have embedded belief systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aee5539d-9273-4540-b276-3f71c2c71153": {"__data__": {"id_": "aee5539d-9273-4540-b276-3f71c2c71153", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e2280b9-4c3d-4fbb-b2e3-306ecd75a8cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3946bde307e2e741ea7bb120bf212322fb65a7c5c63a245d2b05941bed9bf663"}, "2": {"node_id": "08846006-a8b7-4aa8-9519-982a894624dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "51c6ba9a9348de4c4ba131733dc122a7d998f897d3a33d7c150a7fd3f9bea50d"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1b13fe7-5029-4825-9b68-cbceeff17896", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37f9b9dfd6b3b61f561653abc86c1315ab65c2d5a17f0e0fcfd5b43594a1d4b3"}}, "hash": "5fbba4ad24dfd8ca70a1d327b67482a2f73f60f700a01a4fdf71a149013da274", "text": "There\u2019s also a lot of hand-wringing about violence and how you are as bad as the cultists for resorting to murder to solve Hope County\u2019s issues. It\u2019s a bit cliche, but there are some surprising bits of social commentary nestled in among the stereotypical hillbillies, survivalists, righteous priests, and alien hunters. I just wish there was more of it. Ubisoft did lots of research to make sure Eden\u2019s Gate has a believable cult structure, but it\u2019s not explored enough in-game. I wouldn\u2019t even know John Seed was a lawyer if I hadn\u2019t read the information elsewhere. Despite being the main attraction, the bad guys just don\u2019t get enough screen time. Still, Far Cry 5 is an interesting game to play in 2018, and it\u2019s easily the best the series has been since Vaas asked us if we knew the definition of insanity in 2012.
