profile Ubisoft employees. We know things have been tough and the company is certainly making all the right noises, but I feel strongly that reviews should, where possible, reflect on the culture in which games are created. Though I worry that art can't be divorced from the artist, at the same time, I appreciate that many hundreds of people contribute to Ubisoft's vast portfolio, and that their work shouldn't be overshadowed by the disgraceful conduct of a handful of people. It's a balance I'm still struggling with, to be honest, but it's hard to immerse yourself in a game that has seemingly come at such a cost to some. Here's hoping this is the last time a Ubisoft game comes with this caveat, eh?The old adage says it's grim up North, but I'm not sure anything north of the M25 is as grim as Ubisoft's devastating vision of a broken, near-future London.As a fairly dark and twisty person myself, I figured I'd embrace DedSec London's tale a little more greedily than the sunshine and sea lions of Watch Dogs 2's San Francisco, but Legion is too terrifyingly real, and just a tad too grim. I doubt the very real climate in the UK is helping much - which clearly isn't Ubisoft's fault - but I usually play games to escape the ills of Westminster, not to be smacked over the head by them. I appreciate that terrorist attacks and food banks and too many homeless people add a frosty layer of authenticity to this fictional vision of the capital, and I know this isn't Ubisoft's fault, either, but good grief, it's depressing to recognise so many signs of a fictional dystopia from your local real-life news reports. Anyway. A devastating terrorist attack rips the capital apart, and DedSec - the hacktivist organisation we've known since the start of the franchise - sets to right the wrongs and uncover who was responsible for the attacks and hold them to account. No, it's not an especially new or engaging conceit, but it's fit for purpose - just about.Unlike the games before it that boasted both a sullen facsimile of a human being - that's Aiden Pierce, in case you forgot him (and most of us have, let's face it) - and his very antithesis, Marcus Holloway, a man stuffed with charm and good humour - there is no central character in Watch Dogs: Legion. Instead, you play as... well, anyone you fancy, really. Want to be a living statue clad in a golden spacesuit? Fill your boots. Fancy living life as a football eff-wit who lives to smash things up? Off you pop. The world is full of potential recruits, and you can play as any one of them. It's an astonishing feat. Trouble is, without a central playable character, there's little to tether you to DedSec's cockney HQ. Although the supporting cast is suitably eccentric and delightfully sweary, they lack the larger-than-life personalities of Watch Dogs 2's Marcus and his crew, which makes them curiously expendable. It's just as well the game's chief conceit is that we can play as anyone because I feel no emotional connection to a single one of them. They're procedurally-generated shells that never feel anything other than procedurally-generated shells and therefore foster no sense of camaraderie, no matter how many group photos you foist upon them at the safe house.And while the permadeath feature undoubtedly adds a dash of peril to your encounters, ultimately, it only serves to further sever you from the cast. What's the point of getting attached when their lines are transferable to the next operative on the rota and there are Riot Drones and permadeath to contend with?The problem's further compounded by some truly dodgy voice acting that feels peculiarly at odds with the faces attached to it. Stormzy's voice work is one of few performances that felt nuanced and sincere, but otherwise they only served to divorce me from the world, not immerse me in it, and I ended up with three different women in my squad who all had the same voice and lines. I know it's not practical to have individual voices for the literally infinite numbers of NPCs strutting about the place, but there's significantly less variety than I'd been expecting (and if you'll permit me a stroppy tangent: has Ubisoft never heard of Wales? Despite many Scottish and Irish accents flying the flag for the Celts, I didn't encounter a single Welsh accent on my travels).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6500cbde-8603-4889-ad75-87446de85e84": {"__data__": {"id_": "6500cbde-8603-4889-ad75-87446de85e84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ce6e90f-c4bd-4632-bc23-004e9c623d2d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "88af55f249ef9c150a789bf8626a9635c57f2576a3a2fa45498202e1b1e92d11"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab3d9999-1a2a-4367-a3ef-dc1d3e5a9bdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8dc7ef7b39f035370c39da64a65b364afcdf9787252836eab93a571fc4320bc7"}}, "hash": "18bf4e2176e22afc0ed17e3a50303d52d93a4b77eb1f7e98b1f3c1b595b373e1", "text": "The story, though passable, fails to innovate on the excellent Watch Dogs 2, and it felt very much as if the skills and gadgets - while admittedly expanded this time around - don't bring much added value to the party. I chiefly defaulted to camo or my spiderbot, particularly when I unlocked the ability to shroud fallen enemies. Few things are more satisfying than taking down an unsuspecting foe with a facehugger-esque squeeze to the face and then shrouding the corpse from view.Sadly, there's very little variety in the mission types, too, with most revolving around infiltration, hacking - which is perfunctory if occasionally clumsy - and escaping a restricted area. Once you've upgraded your spiderbot and get adept at spotting handy vents, you can often complete missions without ever setting foot in the place, and while it's initially thrilling to creep around a secret base on the top of Tower Bridge when your operative is tucked away on the ground below, it will eventually grow stale as missions rarely deviate from this template.I got so good at infiltration, actually, that my efficiency surprised the game as much as it shocked me. In one particularly memorable sequence, I was directed to \"survive\" whilst my AI companion Bagley - who irritates more than he assists - unlocked a secret elevator. But as I'd stealthily killed every goon in the place with my trusty spiderbot beforehand, there was nothing to endure except the boredom as I waited for Bagley to do his thing. The gunplay remains a little spotty, too, but there are definite improvements in hand-to-hand combat, and it feels like our London foes are made of sturdier stuff than the insta-crumble population of Watch Dogs 2. You'll no doubt gauge by the lateness of these words that I was one of the reviewers afflicted by the console-crashing bug that almost bricked my Xbox One X. Sadly, I can't say I'd been having a particularly great time up until that point anyway, but the bug did put a premature halt to my campaign progress and instead sent me out into London to explore at my leisure. Like many games forged in the Ubisoft mould, this is where the world opens up and I started to enjoy myself. Driving around mindlessly doesn't do much for me - I still hate the driving in this series, not least because the music selection is astonishingly meagre, and although I had never heard of Boston Manor before, I am now far more informed of their work than I ever expected to be. Also, the AI of the people roaming the streets of London is flawed to the point of hilarity. Pedestrians frequently - inexplicably - jump into the road rather than away from it.By the time you start collating Tech Points and unlocking and upgrading your gadgets and gizmos, though, things get considerably more enjoyable. I spent a lot of time as a construction worker, not because of that snazzy hi-viz vest, but because of their super handy cargo drone. Big enough to accommodate both you and its cargo, you can not only use it to get across the city, but also access the collectibles frequently secreted on or around rooftops, too. While it's not the speediest device, it's certainly a relaxing way to take in the sights of London and move around.Unlocking the ability to hijack drones also had a positive impact on my enjoyment, too. At first, the things are hideously overpowered and thanks to the floaty driving, you can't even outpace the bloody things, but once you're able to get them and turrets on-side, it should certainly make encounters feel a little less unbalanced, and a hell of a lot more more. But it's desperately underbaked. Dialogue cuts out part way through, either because you've inadvertently triggered yet another loading screen, or because the game simply crapped out. Sometimes operatives won't go into cover, which is super fun when you're in the middle of a gunfight.

The concept seems sound\u2014rather than playing a traditional protagonist, you recruit a team of heroes from randomly generated, ordinary citizens of London. The problem with ordinary people, though, is that they're ordinary. I have a filmmaker on my team. An ambulance driver. A legal assistant. A lady whose only skill is that she owns a car.What is it? An open world action stealth game set in a dystopian future London\nExpect to pay: $60/\u00a355\nDeveloper: Ubisoft\nPublisher: Ubisoft\nReviewed on: RTX 2080, Intel \u00a0i7-9700K , 16GB RAM\nMultiplayer: Coming in December\nLink: Official siteIt's not exactly a dream team, and initially I'm so uninterested in my collection of \"heroes\" that when one of them (the car lady) is kidnapped by an enemy I don't even bother rescuing her. Go ahead and keep her, I shrug. I can steal a car if I need one.But a few hours and several new recruits later, another member of my team is kidnapped, and this time I fly into an absolute rage. This is another team member who owns a car, but it's an extremely fast car because he's not just a driver, he's a getaway driver. He has a skill that prevents police drones from chasing him while he's driving, and another skill that forces every car in his path off the road, parting traffic like the Red Sea. Both are indispensable to me. He also has a cool leather jacket and driving gloves and shades\u2014he just looks like a driver from an action movie. I like this guy a lot, and I like playing as him, and the thought of some enemy stealing him from me is absolutely unacceptable. That's when I realize Legion's play-as-anyone system is actually working for me, and that I've gotten invested in it. It just took a while to assemble a team of anyones I actually cared about.In Watch Dogs Legion, hacker group DedSec has been framed for a series of terrorist bombings in London, and its members are all dead, missing, or jailed. An oppressive private military firm, Albion, is now running London, a ruthless mob boss is running drugs, weapons and human trafficking operations in the city, and there's also a branch of government intelligence and a billionaire tech mogol to contend with. Starting from scratch with a single, largely unremarkable citizen, I slowly assemble a new DedSec crew to fight back.Looking for new recruits in London is an engrossing and time-consuming activity in and of itself. Scanning citizens as I pass them on the street or peeking at them through security cameras gives me a look at their attributes, both good and bad. An eldery mechanic might wield a heavy wrench for melee attacks but have low mobility and damage resistance due to his age. A medic may have a uniform, useful for infiltrating hospitals, and a dart gun for non-lethal takedowns, but they also might be a compulsive gambler who will regularly lose DedSec's money. A beekeeper I met has the ability to send swarms of cyberbees to attack targets, but also has incurable hiccups that can alert guards when they're trying to be stealthy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f508ccf5-5ed6-43db-b579-f3cc66e8ea7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f508ccf5-5ed6-43db-b579-f3cc66e8ea7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "0eb79d05-7fd4-44a9-8677-a9586d3161e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ba484c0c7e89169a3072ccc06d8226430649728f399d2ff235a5720f00998de"}, "3": {"node_id": "202d0a53-9fb4-4dd6-b071-37734f1ac658", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef8646441c2275615334af50688cc7ca4ea4cb1416f1933f3073ee1b19c259da"}}, "hash": "0293fcbb6575958756793b513e90f61c7bf0a2c1b41e173550725d185c51b963", "text": "Every trip through the city adds someone new to your shopping list, either because they seem useful, like a hacker or combat specialist, or they're a novelty, like a guy who farts uncontrollably or someone who may abruptly drop dead.And there are finer details to dig into. Every citizen has a bio, and I found myself obsessively scrutinizing them to help me decide who to recruit. One former cop still had contacts on the police force, which would mean less jail time for my agents. Great! But his bio told me he was an anti-vaxxer. Ew! No. A drunken brawler is an animal rights activist and donates clothing to a queer youth shelter, which is a big yes in my book. A translator only watches \"heartwarming\" films and uploads erotic fan fiction about members DedSec. She's currently a maybe. None of this has anything to do with how these agents operate, it's just fun flavor to get immersed in and give you a little backstory for the members of your team.The best part of playing as multiple characters is that it frees me up in ways that playing a single protagonist never did.Each citizen has a daily schedule and relationships with other citizens. Even enemy guards don't work 24-7. They leave their posts and walk around in civilian clothing, which is both a nice realistic detail and can provide the opportunity to safely dish out some revenge on them when they're not in heavily restricted areas (like I did with the one who kidnapped my getaway driver). While scanning a wealthy middle-aged government agent, I noticed she had a contact listed as her \"Sugar Baby,\" and sure enough, I later saw her in a pub with her companion having a drink. From time to time you'll run into someone you've met earlier, or someone who knows someone you've met earlier: a relative, their girlfriend, their doctor. If you've helped their acquaintance, they'll know about it and have a positive opinion of you, making them easier to recruit. If you've beaten up their friend, they'll know that too and they'll dislike you. Based on your actions, Legion creates an intriguing web of connections that makes London feel like it's populated with people and not just randomly generated automatons.Like San Francisco in Watch Dogs 2, Legion's London is a nice place to spend time. I've never been to the actual London myself, though from what I'm hearing from some of my British coworkers playing is that it's faithful enough to the real place to navigate without checking the map, while condensing the city and taking liberties here and there.\u00a0Most missions in Legion's open-world are pretty similar: stealthy infiltrations into secure buildings and areas filled with guards, cameras, and other security measures. While the configurations of mission areas usually aren't wildly different, it's still satisfying to virtually infiltrate a location, hacking security cameras to spy on the premises, mark the guards, absorb the layouts, and activate traps. Most mission locations can be tackled from different directions and in different ways using gadgets available to all your team members, plus whatever special skills are unique to them. I can send in a semi-creepy spiderbot to crawl through vents or a drone over the roof and into windows to disable security features, then sneak inside, performing stealth takedowns on enemies or slipping past when they're distracted.\u00a0If I don't feel like being all that stealthy, which is often the case, I can take a shortcut by airlifting my agent to the roof with a hijacked cargo drone to get as close as possible to my goal. Or I can just fight my way in with melee combat and guns. As in the earlier Watch Dogs games, it feels the best to clear an entire building of threats remotely and make off with stolen data all while standing safely outside the sidewalk. It's also hectic fun when something goes wrong, the sirens blare, the guards are alerted, and you have to engage in a big messy battle to escape.The best part of playing as multiple characters is that it frees me up in ways that playing a single protagonist never did. For instance, it was always jarring in Watch Dogs 2 when I killed someone while playing as Marcus Holloway, and it seemed bizarre for the charming protagonist to even have a gun. Holloway was such a good guy that even killing someone accidentally felt out of character, let alone going on a blood-soaked rampage.\"Ludonarrative dissonance\" is the far-too-fancy term coined by developer Clint Hocking to describe moments when a game's story contradicts its gameplay, like Holloway driving over crowds of innocent people or shooting cops in the head before having another witty and charming cutscene conversation. So it's suitable that Hocking, Watch Dogs Legion's game director, avoids that entire issue here.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "202d0a53-9fb4-4dd6-b071-37734f1ac658": {"__data__": {"id_": "202d0a53-9fb4-4dd6-b071-37734f1ac658", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "f508ccf5-5ed6-43db-b579-f3cc66e8ea7d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0293fcbb6575958756793b513e90f61c7bf0a2c1b41e173550725d185c51b963"}, "3": {"node_id": "243cb008-c407-4898-8c5c-508ac90d1e7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c54e85002094c773e2e529168f8c988576e6476694f1997f55fdba212119524"}}, "hash": "ef8646441c2275615334af50688cc7ca4ea4cb1416f1933f3073ee1b19c259da", "text": "Depending on the mission and my mood, I can pick someone from my team to be a hero, an opportunist, or a complete and utter bastard without having to cram all those attributes into a single character's head.Initially, my crew was largely non-lethal types, but it's not long before I start dropping bodies using other characters. I recruit a former MI6 spy to my roster, armed with a silenced pistol and a cool watch gadget that lets him jam enemy weapons. He's a James Bond type who wouldn't give a second thought to headshotting any guards that get in his way. That's just part of the gig. I've got a professional hitman on my squad, too, who I recruited after following him around at night and witnessing him stabbing some unfortunate citizen to death in a park. I even recruited a member of Albion, whose uniform lets me wander around secure buildings without drawing too much attention. She doesn't seem the type to worry too much if someone gets riddled with bullets or dies in an explosion, either. Killing with those agents feels perfectly in character, and then I can swap to someone else if I want to return to non-lethal tactics.Just as it took me a few hours to start appreciating my team, it took me a while to warm up to the sheer number of drones in Legion. Drones are everywhere, unleashed by soldiers when you're detected, sent after you while you're fleeing in a car, blasting you with bullets and tear gas and rockets when you're desperately trying to hack into a server or download some data. I hate fighting drones\u2014they're basically like giant flying insects, one of my least favorite enemy types. At one point in Legion I was piloting a drone while trying to protect a friendly drone from being attacked by swarms of enemy drones. Legion really goes all in on drones, and for a while I couldn't stand it.I am a drone convert.But as I unlocked more skills for my team, my anger at drones slowly turned into appreciation because I could disable them, hijack and pilot them, and even turn their AI against my enemies. Now, overhearing a soldier say he's sending a drone out to look for me is music to my ears. Dude, you're just giving me another weapon to destroy you with. If the bad guys don't send drones after me I'll hijack any random ones flying around the area instead. I am a drone convert.I even have a drone expert on my team, a guy named Fallon. He can summon his own drone, which can be remotely piloted to deliver electric shocks that KO most enemies with one blast. He can also chuck a second drone into the air that will divebomb and incapacitate a targeted enemy. Plus, my unlocked team skills let him disable one enemy drone, commandeer a second one, and tell a third to fight for him on autopilot. That's five different drones Fallon has access to within a few seconds in a single fight. Drones went from being a nuisance to the centerpiece of my infiltration and combat strategy, and Fallon became the star of my team. He's basically my protagonist now, since I use him far more than anyone else. It doesn't hurt that he's an amazing-looking guy as the result of random generation: his head covered in spikes, his face and ears filled with dozens of piercings and studs, plus a big bushy gray beard, facial tattoos, and black lipstick to round it all out. I think I like Fallon even more than I liked Marcus Holloway.Unfortunately, I didn't warm up to the Pipe Mania-style puzzles that are a major activity in Legion, in which you complete a circuit by spinning a bunch elbow-segments into the correct configuration (most recently seen in Half-Life: Alyx). Legion does a few novel things with these puzzles, like stretching them across the front of a mansion or looping them around several floors of a skyscraper, so you need to pilot drones, hack cameras, or run a spiderbot around to figure out how to complete them. But they still get tiresome because they're used so damn often\u2014they're even a part of several boss fights. Do you want to solve a Pipe Mania puzzle while being attacked by scores of soldiers and drones? I didn't.I never really got into the story, either, which is almost entirely related to you by Bagley, DedSec's fast-talking, deeply sarcastic AI who briefs you before missions, during missions, after missions\u2014he's not as bad as some chattering robots I could name, but he never really shuts the hell up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "243cb008-c407-4898-8c5c-508ac90d1e7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "243cb008-c407-4898-8c5c-508ac90d1e7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "202d0a53-9fb4-4dd6-b071-37734f1ac658", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef8646441c2275615334af50688cc7ca4ea4cb1416f1933f3073ee1b19c259da"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4b6b09f-7993-4911-bc75-9cd0ada10416", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2441bfa6cc51956b6786feca7f1111f1ced4d1a8ef800defbcbf73fe610bd086"}}, "hash": "8c54e85002094c773e2e529168f8c988576e6476694f1997f55fdba212119524", "text": "Since you're playing as any one of your team members rather than a main character, there's little in the way of meaningful interaction with Bagley\u2014pretty much everything he suggests is A-OK with whichever character you're inhabiting at the time. There's a single choice to be made during the main campaign, otherwise, you're just following a to-do list, completing objectives, and being agreeable.There's also very little nuance to the collection of big bad bosses: they're basically just sneeringly evil types. There's the Albion chief who murders someone during a meeting just to reinforce how darn dastardly he is, the unrepentant gangster running an organ harvesting operation, and the mysterious leader of Zero Day operating under the familiar \"To save this city I must first destroy it\" doctrine, which I think was used in more than one Batman movie. The mystery of Zero Day isn't particularly engaging, but it did have me guessing (wrongly, in fact) who was behind it all, so that's something.And yes, there are a few moments in Legion that present a political point of view. You'll see street protesters railing against the ultra-wealthy, out of work citizens talking about automation taking away their jobs, and people decrying police (Albion) brutality, which aren't the most radical or novel criticisms except that, as we've seen more and more lately, there are plenty of people somehow in favor of those things. There are also a few specific missions to aid undocumented immigrants, like busting them out of jail or providing them with fake passports so they can remain in London. One mission even has you reroute an airplane to prevent illegally detained citizens from being deported. There's not really a strong, cohesive political message running through the game, and definitely it's not an examination of these real issues, but Legion at least feels pro-immigration.I didn't run into any major technical issues, and Legion ran pretty smoothly with a mixture of high and very high settings on my GeForce RTX 2080, apart from some occasional dips in framerates after a few hours of continuous play and one crash that meant I had to replay a late-game mission. There's a considerable bit of jank when it comes to AI pathfinding and physics, though it did sometimes lead to comical moments when a car would bounce around as if it were on springs or an NPC would get stuck in a doorway. I completed the main storyline and some sidequests in about 30 hours, while still leaving plenty undone, like collectible-hunting (get ready for another Ubisoft map filled with icons) and other side missions. And there's lots of fun to be had just messing around in the city of London, causing chaos by remote controlling vehicles, endlessly scanning citizen data for your next favorite operative, or breaking into secure areas just to see what's in them, even without a mission to follow.Watch Dogs Legion's play-as-anyone gamble just about pays off. Most of London's citizens are way too ordinary to be much fun, but the few I grew to care about wound up feeling more important to me than most videogame protagonists ever do. Not bad for a group of randomly generated misfits. And I even wound up loving all those drones.\u00a0Playing as anyone works great in Legion\u2014once you've finally found the right group of anyones.Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s. Following a few years as a regular freelancer, PC Gamer hired him in 2014, probably so he'd stop emailing them asking for more work. Chris has a love-hate relationship with survival games and an unhealthy fascination with the inner lives of NPCs. He's also a fan of offbeat simulation games, mods, and ignoring storylines in RPGs so he can make up his own.Why the original, 1999 version of EverQuest is still one of the best MMOs to play todayCyberpunk 2077's 2.0 overhaul was inspired by the 'old school design' of Diablo 2's skill trees and Doom's 'relentless' combatWordle today: Hint and answer #861 for Saturday, October 28By Katie Wickens18 October 2023By Jacob Ridley17 October 2023By Noah Smith16 October 2023By Ian Evenden13 October 2023By Tom Hatfield12 October 2023By Harvey Randall12 October 2023By Rick Lane10 October 2023By Jorge Jimenez9 October 2023By Jacob Ridley5 October 2023By Phil Iwaniuk4 October 2023By Dave James4 October 2023PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Police brutality, surveillance states, and the decline of democracy as we know it? I get enough of that in my morning headlines, thank you very much.\u00a0But though Ubisoft Toronto's vision of London may be dark, dystopian, and perpetually cloaked in raincloud, this third chapter to its open-world hacking saga is secretly just as happy and glorious as Watch Dogs 2's sun-soaked sojourn through San Francisco. You just have to look between the pavement cracks a little closer.Watch our video review below:Set in a post-Brexit (and presumably post-pandemic) future, Watch Dogs Legion's sci-fi tinged recreation of The Big Smoke is a playground I can't stop causing chaos in, and not just because of any native connections to the city itself. It's a place practically reverberating with life, both in the macro of every neon-lit monument towering across the urban skyline, and the micro of London's smog-ridden streets, where the personality of each of its distinct boroughs is on full display.Pubs are teeming with smug young professionals, graffiti and targeted advertisements plaster the city's eclectic architecture, and a growing sense of civil unrest permeates almost every conversation you hear amongst pedestrians. Yes, the Dick Van Dyke meets Billy Butcher accents are ridiculously over the top at the best of times, and it's not even the prettiest open world in Ubisoft's track record, but for the most part, Watch Dogs Legion captures the soul and style of London better than any video game I've played.Of course, a key part of Watch Dogs Legion's charm isn't just London itself, but the perspectives from which you get to explore it. In what is easily the game's biggest selling point, Ubisoft has ripped the N out of NPC to let players step into the shoes of any of the city's civilians you set your sights upon. By recruiting fellow Londonites into your ever-growing gang of DedSec resistance fighters, you can take on missions as all manner of characters, from 007 superspies to street magicians.\u00a0Every member comes with their own set of abilities, status effects, weapons, or vehicles, which can either help or hinder your efforts to liberate London from its postmodern oppression by various factions capitalising on the societal breakdown. Your newly enlisted mechanical beekeeper might be able to summon a robot hive on-demand, for example, but his tendency to get hiccups when nervous means you can say bub-bye to that stealth run. The number of variables at play in Ubisoft's populace-generating algorithm aren't quite endless, but they are impressively extensive, affecting everything from movement speed to lifespan.\u00a0As a result, your DedSec army will be comprised of an absurdly diverse bunch of freedom fighters from all walks of life, and though the limits of the system can be seen in the way certain perks (and voices) will repeat themselves over the game's 20-25 hour runtime, it's always fun to discover a completely new archetype, and experiment with their unique playstyles and quirks.Release date: October 29, 2020\nPlatform: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC\nPublisher/Developer: UbisoftIn typical Ubisoft fashion, you'll be able to tackle the majority of Legion's main story missions your own way, and the developer's trademark open-ended design is only enhanced further by the sheer variety of people you can choose to tackle them as.\u00a0In some cases, certain characters will be able to infiltrate areas by the nature of their working uniform, while others can melt through enemies like butter with a small arsenal of impressive firepower.\u00a0Future London also has more gadgets to play with than present-day San Francisco, such as the ability to straight-up fly on hackable drones that act like giant, self-driving taxis. You can say good riddance to endlessly driving those stacking cranes between buildings, in other words, and Watch Dogs Legion is all the better for it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08676c00-44e9-457d-bd79-41f59bda5dc3": {"__data__": {"id_": "08676c00-44e9-457d-bd79-41f59bda5dc3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4b6b09f-7993-4911-bc75-9cd0ada10416", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2441bfa6cc51956b6786feca7f1111f1ced4d1a8ef800defbcbf73fe610bd086"}, "3": {"node_id": "d32b431a-a0ea-4839-adc1-149d2bb601ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d2c074e56f9b6f15870a567a4c1813e5d8a28d14cfb348df7b680aa2fdd1edf"}}, "hash": "ae9975c30157f9e969c0f10646808674302938727a9dd10a45ffb198e3524163", "text": "The missions themselves, aside from a handful of so-so minigames and environmental puzzles, are a lot of \"infiltrate this\" and \"steal that\", but that sense of repetition can be alleviated by the entertainment wrung from undertaking them as whoever you like.Equally, while I was worried that the lack of a central, scripted protagonist might make it difficult to invest in Legion's cast of characters, the inverse is true. Getting to see my hand-picked recruits interact with events and each other in Legion's cleverly rendered in-game cutscenes gave me a reason to care for their involvement in DedSec's resistance efforts, especially considering Ubisoft's wise inclusion of an optional permadeath setting, which can rob you of your favourite characters for good.\u00a0In this way, Watch Dogs Legion takes a page out of X-COM's playbook, establishing meaningful connections to its world via the stories and personalities that players discover for themselves. Your playthrough of Legion is going to be markedly different from mine, then, but no less memorable as a result.\u00a0It's not perfect (recruiting certain characters can take far more time and effort than they're worth), but, on the whole, Legion's Play as Anyone mechanic is on par with Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system in terms of both its ambition and originality; it really is as nifty as it sounds.It's quite remarkable just how much of Legion is sharpened, shaken, and stirred by its central idea\"Sadly, Legion's story isn't nearly as compelling as the playable roster driving it forward. As it did with Far Cry 5, Ubisoft casts its narrative net across a barrier reef's worth of real-world issues to inspire its depiction of London - from the migrant crisis to human trafficking - but paints that subject matter into its setting with fairly broad strokes.\u00a0The result is a story that, for all its talking points, feels strangely innocuous. It doesn't help that the dialogue is often laughably wooden, either, delivered with wild inconsistency depending on who you're playing as, though DedSec's dry-humoured AI companion Bagley does manage to squeeze a few decent jokes into the proceedings every now and again.\u00a0As for the gameplay itself, anyone who's played a previous Watch Dogs instalment will be familiar with Legion's open-world trifecta of driving, shooting, and stealth, all of which is of course augmented by its one-button hacking mechanic, which can now tap into more of the open world's central operating system than ever before. These different avenues of play represent something of a mixed bag, however, often feeling either too formless and floaty, or awkward and stilted.\u00a0There's a general lack of polish that pervades throughout Watch Dogs Legion as a whole, in fact, with my PS4 build of the game (which included the Day One patch) running into a number of texture pop-ins, clipping issues, framerate drops, and several hard crashes. Ubisoft has confirmed its already addressing some of these bugs for an incoming update, while Legion's frequent and lengthy loading screens will apparently be next to non-existent on PS5 and Xbox Series X, but these technical gripes are still worth bearing in mind before you jump in on launch day.\u00a0Problems aside, it's quite remarkable just how much of Legion is sharpened, shaken, and stirred by its central idea, and rightly so. In executing its lofty power fantasy, Ubisoft's Play as Anyone mechanic has elevated the rest of Legion's otherwise routine gameplay; without it, I'm not sure we'd have a particularly memorable video game on our hands.\u00a0Like that of Assassin's Creed's dual protagonists, I now can't imagine the Watch Dogs series without its Play as Anyone mechanic, which feels like a feature the franchise was always made for. Despite the deficiencies that underscore both its storytelling and gameplay, Legion thus represents an aspiring, albeit somewhat clumsy, step forward for the series at large. If a continued pivot towards dystopianism is what's needed to inspire Ubisoft to keep refining and honing its new APC formula for Watch Dogs' future, then I say bring on the end of the world as we know it.\u00a0I'm GamesRadar's Features Writer, which makes me responsible for gracing the internet with as many of my words as possible, including reviews, previews, interviews, and more.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, The third Watch Dogs game moves the action to London and has a cameo from Stormzy but what is its vision of future Britain really like?Since London has the most CCTV cameras of any Western country in the world it\u2019s almost surprising it hasn\u2019t featured in Watch Dogs before. Ubisoft\u2019s mix of Grand Theft Auto and virtual hacktivism has now finally realised the potential of the setting, although one of the many disappointing things about Legion is that, really, it could be set in any city or country for all the difference it makes to the story and gameplay. Although that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not entirely without merit.None of the Watch Dogs games have any close connection, just the idea that each city they\u2019re set in uses a pervasive computer system called ctOS, which means everything from a webcam to a heavily-armed drone is connected and hackable via your smartphone. The first game was set in Chicago and the second in San Francisco, but by the time of Legion ctOS has become an everyday part of life and the real concern is that the British government has all but collapsed and an evil private military company has essentially taken over London.Before release there was much talk of Legion being set post-Brexit and reflecting current news headlines in its portrayal of a near future dystopia. But the backstory of the world is never really mentioned and while the game promotes a healthily sceptical view of politics and capitalism it doesn\u2019t offer any serious critique.Apart from the London setting the major difference between Legion and previous games is that you don\u2019t play as any pre-set characters. Instead you\u2019re able to play as literally anyone else in the game, recruiting people off the street almost instantaneously if they\u2019re sympathetic or after doing a quick side quest for them if they\u2019re not.Some people are more useful than others and have specific skills or equipment that makes them desirable, especially special recruits whose existence is occasionally advertised to you and which include the likes of hitmen and James Bond style superspies.You can play the game with permadeath on but otherwise characters are taken out of action for up to 30 minutes if they \u2018die\u2019 and sent to either jail or hospital. Recruiting lawyers, barristers, and medics to your cause can help reduce this time, although usually those characters are no use in a fight.It\u2019s a neat gimmick, that\u2019s fascinating at first, but has the obvious downside that none of the characters are given a proper story arc or well-defined personality, since you could be playing with literally anyone. It doesn\u2019t help that most characters are created at random in terms of visuals, voices, and scripts, which leads to frequently bizarre match-ups, such as our barrister that sounds like a cockney barrow boy and a low level security guard who talks like she went to Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College.Such things are not impossible but it\u2019s very obvious the game is just generating characters at random and ruining the sense of verisimilitude as it does so. Especially as everyone\u2019s accent and clothing is so exaggerated, often to the point of parody. Really, when have you ever seen anyone wearing a bowler hat non-ironically in London?In gameplay terms, if you\u2019ve played an open world game before then you\u2019ve played Watch Dogs: Legion. From the simplistic stealth mechanics, one-note combat, and wireframe detective mode to the Mutt \u2018n\u2019 Jeff enemies with goldfish memories, everything is competent and nothing is surprising.The only wrinkle is that most enemies will fight you hand-to-hand at first, unless you pull out a gun yourself.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6990a6e7-be6a-48b2-9b23-6fa87cfe16c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6990a6e7-be6a-48b2-9b23-6fa87cfe16c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "d32b431a-a0ea-4839-adc1-149d2bb601ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d2c074e56f9b6f15870a567a4c1813e5d8a28d14cfb348df7b680aa2fdd1edf"}, "3": {"node_id": "40e4ac4b-0731-4770-9310-137f795bc3ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "664d4ef79702aa837d35972d993ebde14027322a6b78fb6bb9df5fd1603b22fb"}}, "hash": "b54bfa91763f73488037a862582d1b0d057b08432658f730fd149164586316df", "text": "This is a neat way to reflect Britain\u2019s very different gun culture, compared to the US, but the melee combat, with its flailing, weightless animation, is so shallow it\u2019s too tempting to just pull out a gun and get things over with more quickly.None of the gameplay evolves at all throughout the course of the game, including a simple puzzle mechanic where you hack networks by rotating junction points in the wall to make a complete loop. The same puzzle type is used in the first proper story mission and is still being used in identical fashion in the final one. Which is all the sadder given the camera-based puzzles of the earlier games are no longer really a thing, probably because they were viewed as too difficult (read: interesting).There is a range of unlockable gadgets but the spiderbot with a turret is so useful it\u2019s usually all you need \u2013 especially as you can just hijack flying drones if you need them. In fact, some abilities are so handy there\u2019s almost no point in choosing any other, especially the construction worker who can call in a cargo drone that you can climb onto \u2013 which can be used to circumvent great chunks of the game, including what was clearly supposed to be an extra hard mission towards the end.Legion is an easy game to pick fault with, but we shouldn\u2019t give the impression it\u2019s not fun. Everything, from the driving to the shooting, works very competently \u2013 and is notably better than the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 \u2013 but if you haven\u2019t seen it all a dozen times before then we can only assume this is your first ever video game.Visually the game is, again, competent without ever being exceptional. The whole dystopia angle means London is portrayed in a particularly grubby state but the replication of the city is highly impressive, even more so than Spider-Man\u2019s New York \u2013 given the size and complexity of the real location. There\u2019s some texture and object pop-in, occasional screen tearing, and some other minor glitches but compared to the Ubisoft norm it\u2019s virtually bug free. It really could do with Sony\u2019s patent fast loading though, which will make the next gen versions interesting to see.Rather than fighting the status quo the plot actually revolves around bringing down five \u2018villains of London\u2019. This includes a tech billionaire with mummy issues and a mockney crime boss, who are portrayed as so one-dimensionally evil they might as well have just thrown Skeletor into the mix and given up any pretence of taking things seriously.The three lead writers are all North American and it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t have a complete grasp of British culture and slang, with words like mate and quid frequently being used in odd ways and one bizarre scene where a character visits a pub and is given ale to drink out of a can, instead of a glass. We know it\u2019s supposed to be a dystopia, but nothing else in the game portrays quite that level of barbarism.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader\u2019s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepSurprisingly, the most authentic moment comes from a brief optional mission featuring Stormzy. It only lasts long enough to play his new music video on the outside of the Waterloo IMAX but not only does he look and sound like a real person but his speech comprises one of the only pointedly political moments in the whole game. It\u2019s delivered with great gusto too and it\u2019s shame he\u2019s not a bigger part of the plot.It was inevitable that the Watch Dogs formula would begin to show signs of age the third time round, even with the play as anyone gimmick. We had hoped the setting and storyline would help to compensate but both are utilised in a very superficial and unengaging way. Unlike Stormzy, the game doesn\u2019t really have anything to say other than to give vague warnings about capitalism, surveillance society, and increased mechanisation.It\u2019s good to see any game, especially one from Ubisoft, address such issues but Legion does it in such a superficial and charmless manner it never really registers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40e4ac4b-0731-4770-9310-137f795bc3ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "40e4ac4b-0731-4770-9310-137f795bc3ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "6990a6e7-be6a-48b2-9b23-6fa87cfe16c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b54bfa91763f73488037a862582d1b0d057b08432658f730fd149164586316df"}, "3": {"node_id": "c0a50d3c-db20-4a53-bcfa-843690ad8a30", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "eae475c9f071a63b354611205025064452b999c4f8c9e72a2f1da594e6148911"}}, "hash": "664d4ef79702aa837d35972d993ebde14027322a6b78fb6bb9df5fd1603b22fb", "text": "Legion is obviously similar to previous Watch Dogs games but its bland competence also reminded us of Days Gone, with characters that are never changed by anything that happens to them and gameplay so derivative and repetitive you can almost play it on autopilot.Where the series goes next is impossible to tell until Legion\u2019s public reception becomes clear but we hope that whatever city it fixates on next time it\u2019s used as something more than just a new backdrop to the same old gameplay.In Short: A disappointingly tame vision of a near future dystopia, that represents a perfectly competent use of the Ubisoft formula but falters in its attempts to add anything new to it.Pros: The gameplay mechanics are all above average for a modern day open world game and the plot toys with some interesting issues. Play as anyone feature is clever, if flawed. Stormzy is great.Cons: Extremely derivative and repetitive from the first moment, in terms of action, stealth, and puzzles.

Instead of putting you in control of a single protagonist, Watch Dogs: Legion gives you thousands of disgruntled Londoners, providing the freedom and flexibility to fight like never before. Despite a few bad apples, they don\u2019t spoil what\u2019s ultimately an entertaining fight for freedom.Your objective is to retake London from its enemy kingpins. You explore and reclaim boroughs through a variety of activities, including sabotage, evidence gathering, and promoting your own propaganda. Where Watch Dogs: Legion sets itself apart from many open-world games is its city full of potential heroes.Amassing your army of agents is a fulfilling and strategic endeavor. Anyone can be recruited, and I felt like a kid in a candy store scanning Londoners thanks to the cool combinations of skills each can bring. For example, one of my favorite members was a futuristic beekeeper who commanded swarms of robotic hornets. Techies hack devices faster, investors rake in more money, protesters can rally bystanders to fight, and spies bring gadgets and combat expertise. It\u2019s delightfully silly to command a group resembling a tech-savvy Village People, and the game doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, making it fun to revel in the absurdity.\u00a0I grew to cherish certain team members for their skillsets and zaniness (especially because I played with the optional permadeath turned on).Most of the side content consists of satisfying the needs of potential recruits. They\u2019re decently fun tasks, but start repeating themselves too soon. Borough uprisings offer better diversions thanks to their variety and the exciting final missions each neighborhood presents. Lesser activities like package deliveries and graffiti tagging provide lighter thrills, but they at least give an excuse to tour Legion\u2019s beautiful, high-tech take on London.\u00a0\u00a0The main story missions are much more gratifying. Four genuinely despicable villains provide plenty of motivation to free London of their tyranny, and your tasks focused on taking them down regularly surprised me with their creativity. One of the best involves a surprisingly heartbreaking trek through the disturbing home of a scientist obsessed with digitizing human mind.Smart level design forces players to consider the right person for the job while also allowing multiple approaches. Strutting into an Albion stronghold disguised as an employee is just as viable as sending combat drones to mow down threats ahead of time.

To that end, the game makes excellent use of its gadgets, like drones, cameras, and turrets. I especially like the spiderbots \u2013 arachnid-like drones that provide a satisfying way to circumvent heavily guarded areas. Plus, I also enjoyed the stealthy platforming segments dedicated to them.\u00a0Commanding various robots is also fun in combat and for puzzle-solving. Riding atop large cargo drones like Spider-Man\u2019s Green Goblin is particularly awesome. Not only can soaring overhead bypass a lot of obstacles, but raining hell from above is supremely entertaining. I love how Legion allows players to combine their tools for creative improvisation. I got a kick from attaching spider turrets atop cars or cargo drones to create mobile murder machines. Enemy A.I. can be boneheaded at times, but the gameplay is a blast that gets better with every upgrade and ability unlocked.\u00a0While Watch Dogs: Legion mostly sells the fantasy of a wholly unique populous, hearing the same handful of voice samples or viewing similar character portraits with slight variations sullies that vision a bit. Another small but regular annoyance comes in the load time while switching agents (at least on current-gen hardware). While not egregiously long, it\u2019s just enough of a delay to break your stride.Legion feels like the realization of the hacker fantasy the first Watch Dogs tried to capture.

Play as anyone, say the marketers, touting your ability to recruit literally anyone you meet on the street to your cyber-hacktivist cause. That\u2019s great, but absent pre-written player characters, developing in and changed by a narrative, would that mean I\u2019d care about no one?Then Blake McCleary, my 58-year-old industrial designer, chugged a couple of eisbocks in a pub in Southwark, threw a round of darts, and went off to his next assignment for DedSec. McCleary was assigned to rescue Lydia Anderson, a stage magician whose talent is using hypnosis to turn a foe friendly. Anderson is also a gambling addict with bad debts, which led to her kidnapping.McCleary easily slipped inside the gangster hideout where Anderson was being held. The core gameplay loop of Watch Dogs: Legion \u2014 sneak around, get the drop on the goons, stroll out triumphantly \u2014 is enjoyable enough that I was happy to do another rescue in the same location where I\u2019d done the last. This time I charged up an electro-fist, a one-hit KO, to obliterate the lone goon guarding Anderson. Unfortunately, she was killed in the blast. Then, her distraught friends kidnapped him, and I had to bring in Emeka Garba, a 23-year-old Tom Haverford-ish reality TV fameball, to save McCleary. This time, Garba parked the electro-fist for a more discreet cloaking device.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

You might be left with that feeling if you play without the game\u2019s permadeath option, which has to be activated at the start of a campaign (it can be later turned off, but not reactivated). I recommend users turn the permadeath option on. It feels like the \u201cright way\u201d to play.I\u2019m glad I restarted Watch Dogs: Legion\u2019s campaign very early in my playthrough, after finding the guards\u2019 and thugs\u2019 oblivious AI triflingly easy to exploit at standard difficulty. Only permadeath and hard difficulty forced me to plan out and solve each level as a puzzle \u2014 which should be the enjoyment of a game built around hacking, after all \u2014 rather than blunder through an impromptu shooting gallery out of impatience or a bad decision. Experienced gamers, or anyone familiar with how Ubisoft handles the stealth business, should play on these settings.I didn\u2019t find any nasty difficulty spikes waiting for me as the story advanced through the Ubisoft formula of taking down a series of bad actors and discovering how they\u2019re linked, before the big reveal and concluding showdown. Watch Dogs: Legion\u2019s story may be templatized, but it benefits considerably from a richly illustrated, believably near-future London, and plot lines that are unafraid to tackle troubling subjects or put a subtle opinion on them.In Watch Dogs: Legion, a pretextual terrorist attack has given a private military corporation full control of London \u2014 with the authority even to suspend Parliament. DedSec, the antihero hacking team, is framed for the blasts and nearly wiped out. The player begins the game by reconstituting the London chapter, and uncovering the truth connecting London\u2019s mercenary rulers with the city\u2019s disturbingly exploitable technology and the techno-oligarchs behind it.In my adventures, I confronted an organ-harvesting operation fronted by gangsters; undocumented immigrants herded into squalid conditions and exploited as forced laborers; and a police force, co-opted by military influence, brutalizing its public. To Watch Dogs: Legion\u2019s credit, it neither shies away from themes that echo real-life events and current anxieties, nor depicts their morality with a heavy hand. The game has a show-don\u2019t-tell tone in presenting London under an authoritarian regime and the attitudes that got it there. I never got the sense that DedSec was always in the right, more than it was just the group doing the most things that were right, where no one else would. Even then, I recruited to my team a doctor (Tharindu Cabral) who had lost his license after a case in which one of his patients got addicted to painkillers. The scripted mission that put the medic on my team involved stealing an ambulance full of narcotics, which would be given to this patient. I\u2019m not sure that unstructured self-medication, even to wean someone off a dependency, is a clinically appropriate response. Whatever the case, it was clear from the banter between my character and Bagley, the AI helping DedSec, that our new teammate was not to be welcomed with open arms.Watch Dogs: Legion got me to play with this medic, and as a lot of people I never would have created in an ordinary character builder or avatar customizer. And thanks to permadeath, they were worth careful play, because losing one delivered the kind of angst I\u2019d only felt when a trusty operative was killed in XCOM. Diana Dutta was my first skilled hacker, taking over as my primary operative from my starter character, Timothy Abbasi, who had a punk haircut and black leather jacket that made him look more like a cyber-anarchist. Dutta looked like she\u2019d just left a cube-farm workplace where she didn\u2019t fit in and, from the way she always played with her phone, like she couldn\u2019t be bothered to have an interesting conversation.But boy, did she have a toolkit. She could skim passkeys from unlimited range \u2014 enormously helpful in a game where I was frequently hopping from hijacked security camera to camera, trying to find the one close enough (if there even was one) to steal the key to the door.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "649e8f58-bab1-410c-a995-6a4482e8dc67": {"__data__": {"id_": "649e8f58-bab1-410c-a995-6a4482e8dc67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0c8f3d0-3539-44b9-9e0d-59df9f949673", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "502424867e3c22e4a4754139af1d07f239bf4992d5fcefaddcd431e3444b0fae"}, "3": {"node_id": "eda6d4d9-80d3-4b2f-9fae-f5a8cb2ef5d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3fd857ea3d0230ce3c4479af624e0ffc9d96bf720ed2f502f70eb2514c4e268c"}}, "hash": "30879113d1f50f9f5a2144ba00def490f360dca40429ee2bd86f86edcec38424", "text": "Diana could also patch into someone\u2019s Optik (the in-world personal device everyone carries) and send a jolt of electricity through them, a great attack and an even longer-lasting diversion than the standard distraction tool.Those skills paired with something as versatile as the spider-bot made Diana unbeatable to the point that I got careless. The spider-bot is a piece of equipment whose entry-level model can sneak around a building, take down foes from behind, and carry out hacks. In the first third of the game, I wondered why I should choose another piece of equipment, or even another agent.Then I got Diana killed on a mission where she could have just sneaked inside the door under a cloaking device. Instead, I\u2019d given her the spider-bot, and when she was surprised by a sentry, I thought she could shoot her way out of trouble. It was a painful lesson. You can\u2019t build up a character like Diana; her perks and unique traits are all luck-of-the-draw. The equipment and some of the hacks I acquired are available to all characters, but it\u2019s impossible to specifically hunt for a skill like Diana\u2019s unlimited key-stealing.Later on, when I picked up a drone specialist, Heidi Bull, I played very, very carefully, mindful of what had happened with Diana. Heidi has the skill that lets her turn any drone against its handlers. For the team as a whole, you get that capability on a drone-by-drone basis, and as the last rank of a fully upgraded perk. Heidi was so dependable, and such an homage to Diana, it was appropriate that she was the operative in the larger story\u2019s pivotal moments.As helpful as the skills are, I never got the sense that there were certain levels or encounters that could only be solved with one of them. Ubisoft Toronto generously balances the game to the point where your starting, one-perk character could \u2014 with enough of the upgraded skills and weapons available to everyone \u2014 take on every assignment. While this encourages a lot of experimentation and exploration, the two lower difficulties are so forgiving that certain skills can become overpowered. The spider-bot is a great example; on easy and standard difficulty, I could sneak up on anyone and take them down with a nasty facehugger attack; only on levels where my hacker had to physically interact with a device did she leave the remote control interface. Harder difficulties don\u2019t really make the guards search more diligently, but they notice their immediate area a lot more.Similarly, the more I played Watch Dogs: Legion, the more I noticed, appreciated, and immersed myself in my surroundings. London looks great, but its sense of place is supported by more than just visuals. I saw a bystander jape at a transient person outside a Tube stop, and later found him getting shoved around by a security guard. Ordinarily, I\u2019d help such a person out (with the game\u2019s disappointingly easy melee system, as prone to counterattack abuse as Assassin\u2019s Creed used to be). But this time I had more important things to do.And Watch Dogs: Legion gives you just enough without dragging it into the most dreaded swamp of open-world games: repetition. A lot of this is helped by the fact that you can do the same tasks with different operatives (acquiring the tech points to upgrade a skill set, for example). But the most necessary tasks \u2014 liberating the boroughs, recruiting highly skilled operatives, and doing the capstone missions for both \u2014 have enough narrative involvement to keep them from being boring. And the rote parts (collecting lore text and audio) are purely optional.Mostly, I am impressed at how Ubisoft Toronto got me to care about people more than skills, even in a game set up to prioritize the latter. Like a card trick, I\u2019m left with the sense that the developers coaxed me to pick the person the game needed to complete this particular chapter of the story, while making it seem like it was my call all the way. For interactive entertainment, that\u2019s outstanding storytelling, and it supports gameplay that has rewarded my own risk-taking and creativity with the urge to play it all again, with an entirely new cast.

The core conceit of Legion lies in the old adage of \"strength in numbers,\" which manifests in the game letting you recruit and play as nearly any character you come across, amassing a ragtag crew of freedom fighters. This open-ended stance to fighting the system is a significant change for the franchise, and it's bolstered by improved hacking and social-engineering gameplay. Legion's approach, while admirable, does have some unintended issues that make its powerful message of unity waver at inopportune times, but it still manages to make a profound statement about hope with its novel approach to player agency.Legion is set in a near-future, more technologically advanced London. Longstanding hacker group DedSec has been framed for a series of bombings in the city, and its members are branded as terrorists. This, however, was all engineered by the mysterious rival hacker group known as Zero Day. In the chaos after the bombing, London and its citizens are effectively caught in the vice-grip of encroaching fascism and suffocating capitalism due to the occupation of Albion, a private military group, as well as criminal and corporate enterprises taking advantage of the power vacuum. With many key operatives dead or missing, DedSec London starts from scratch by crowdsourcing new members made up of like-minded citizens wanting to liberate the city.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Watch Dogs: Legion Video ReviewThe London in Watch Dogs: Legion is presented as a more advanced and exaggerated version of the real-life London. However, this interpretation of the city still reflects the present mood of 2020, albeit with more of a cyberpunk-dystopia aesthetic. The city's history and its iconic landmarks are the backdrop for stark futurism. The majesty of Buckingham Palace and the bohemian charm of Camden are washed with parcel delivery drones, holographic advertisements, and self-driving cars that flood your line of sight. Of course, all of this also makes for an exciting playground for your hacking antics.In a game with multiple playable characters, the one constant that you'll have across them is your connection to London itself. Each of the eight districts has its own varied cultures, demographics, and cultural stylings, making England's capital city an exciting place to explore. It's cool to see areas like the Tower of London and Piccadilly Circus recreated with stunning detail, and there's something to appreciate in how much effort went into presenting the locales through a dystopian lens. The game manages to capture the history and the cultural diversity of London, while also juxtaposing it with the banality of evil represented by the presence of Albion, who detain citizens in plain sight.Much of the flavor and atmosphere of the city is rooted in the now. With Brexit, weaponized social media, and far-right ideologies going mainstream, Legion effectively portrays the inherent angst and bewilderment at seeing your country fall slowly into chaos--poignant for the troubles of the present day. The main story deals with topics relating to nationalism, xenophobia, and which class of people should be in control. At times it can get unnerving to see how real life seeps into Legion's story, especially when it comes to the inhumane treatment of immigrants.The main story of Legion is heavy in its subject matter, feeling like a mix of Black Mirror and Mr. Robot. It grapples with themes around nationalism, capitalism, classism, and of course, policing. Although the execution is somewhat scattershot, the moments in which the game chooses to shine a light on these pervading issues can be sobering. The most notable example involves a guest appearance by British grime rapper Stormzy, who gives a rousing and powerful performance confronting systemic racism.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff9d15fc-89b2-4541-b360-259b72d321b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff9d15fc-89b2-4541-b360-259b72d321b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "eda6d4d9-80d3-4b2f-9fae-f5a8cb2ef5d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3fd857ea3d0230ce3c4479af624e0ffc9d96bf720ed2f502f70eb2514c4e268c"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8448961-67d4-4ec5-a82b-5a4c1f8b4e0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ad9c06944f92d686da0cb13f4095afe866c521d8f032c54a79ab1fc300d203a"}}, "hash": "7ecd375b76faad041c74873dbeb4951de39489d35491e986af9bbdbfdeb0e2a7", "text": "He takes the stage and confronts the people with a truth of Legion's world, and it packs a powerful punch because it reflects the realities of our own. \"I am the one they fear the most,\" he says. \"I'm a black man with money.\"Through text messages, podcasts, and other supplementary means of delivering narrative, Legion lays bare even more of the issues plaguing society. Text messages reveal that Albion, effectively a police force, is targeting and harassing citizens in public, and recalling this information as you watch people out on the street fall victim to these practices can sting. Radio shows mock the in-game right-wing ideologies which, when described, sound ridiculous and the stuff of fiction, but aren't all that far from what we hear in real life.What really hits home about Watch Dogs Legion is that, as the cartoonishly bleak world comes into focus, it becomes difficult to ignore the immediate parallels to our own real-world society. Sure, it might not interrogate the issues and explore the nuances with a great deal of depth, but the broad strokes of the brush are enough to blur the line between fiction and reality, and at that point you have to confront just how far our own society has fallen. Ubisoft games have often used real-world politics as set dressing, but on this occasion, it feels like a genuine attempt to at least identify the problems it is leveraging as narrative milieu and present their cold hard truths.For the most part, the main narrative does a good job of tackling these topics, but the impact is lessened somewhat because of the open-world format of the game. The game's scope is too wide to deliver its messages in a sharp and concise way. As a result, the 25-hour main plot can feel like it drifts into the periphery as the core narrative becomes secondary to the moment-to-moment actions and events that occur when the open-world mechanics are at work. The knock-on effect is that the side activities are left to do a lot of the heavy lifting on exploring the nuance in these themes, which they do reasonably well.Like previous games, Watch Dogs: Legion hinges on the familiar loop of open-world gameplay, which entails exploration, combat, stealth, and in-game narrative events. While Legion uses a more streamlined hacking system, it leans much further into the systemic effects of hacking and manipulating social threads to fulfill your goals. Depending on how you utilize the city's ctOS infrastructure--which consists of cameras, phones, computers, AI drones, and other machines you can hack--you can accomplish many of your goals with your enemies being none the wiser, giving you the sense that you're always on a heist.Watch Dogs: Legion reaches its highs when channeling elements of immersive sims, where many of your choices can cascade into a satisfying chain of reactions that yield the desired result. Hacking is your core connection to the world, and it opens up many clever opportunities when it comes to figuring out how to achieve your present goals. In one mission, I came up to an enemy base that had a vehicle I had to recover. While I could have snuck in, knocked out the guards with my non-lethal instruments, and taken the vehicle, I instead went with a more elegant solution. Using the cameras, I was able to remotely examine and download data keys from their tablets to gain access to the base's gates. With the gates now opened, I hacked into the vehicle and had it accelerate forward out of the base. I made a dash for the car and rode off while the guards were left stewing in their confusion. All of this was done without ever setting foot in the base, and it felt incredibly satisfying getting the best of them. Coupled with the randomly generated playable characters, Legion presents many interesting opportunities to take advantage of, and its core gameplay represents the prospect of the Watch Dogs hacker fantasy at its best.Legion's true stars are London's citizens, all of whom are randomly generated based on various professions, ethnic backgrounds, and other personalized details. The previous games allowed you to learn cursory information about citizens around you, but in Legion, you can use this information to scout prospects. Depending on if they favor DedSec, they'll ask you to complete minor objectives to seal the bond. In a clever mechanic, the citizens of London will remember and react to decisions you make. For example, I was surprised a potential recruit disapproved of DedSec because a different character I played as accidentally hit them with a car--the game even makes note of this in their file.With such a vast list of characters, you'll likely find yourself leaning on a select few operatives as your A-team, especially if they are gifted when it comes to hacking, driving, or melee combat. Still, Legion has a way of tossing in a curveball recruit that could be in the running for your new favorite.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8448961-67d4-4ec5-a82b-5a4c1f8b4e0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8448961-67d4-4ec5-a82b-5a4c1f8b4e0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff9d15fc-89b2-4541-b360-259b72d321b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ecd375b76faad041c74873dbeb4951de39489d35491e986af9bbdbfdeb0e2a7"}, "3": {"node_id": "814fa392-ec9d-4e24-b580-f21cd3d69e56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8f3e7f9046f1b641137e2c635f80f6f716d9ff1a28dcb38760ab86b364fab73"}}, "hash": "8ad9c06944f92d686da0cb13f4095afe866c521d8f032c54a79ab1fc300d203a", "text": "A particular standout for me was a gold-painted performance artist who could hide in plain sight to complete his goals--and collect tips while he was at it. It can be bizarre seeing what sort of characters you can pull in on your crusade, and it's solid fun getting to use whatever skills they have in some critical missions to succeed by the skin of their teeth.While each operative is capable, missions can and will likely turn sour after a wrong decision, resulting in all sorts of enemies coming down on you with assault rifles and combat drones. Even failing recruitment missions can set you back, prompting you to work extra hard to get back into a potential candidate's good graces. Adding to this stress is the option to enhance the campaign to include permanent deaths for your operatives--meaning once they fall in a mission, they're gone for good. It's a clever addition that adds a bit more realism and a greater sense of consequence to the campaign, which can make some of the more daring missions feel more stressful, especially knowing that losing a favorite operative will leave a lasting sting. But even without permadeath, the difficulty can still be quite challenging, with failure taking your operative out of the game for a set amount of time.I often found myself falling down a rabbit hole to gain new operatives and explore more of the city to complete the laundry list of objectives required to recruit them. In some cases, I found members of my team kidnapped by their own personal rivals, and I had to undergo an impromptu rescue mission--all of which was randomly generated. The game's constant stream of characters and the opportunities that pop up certainly makes it inviting to break off on tangents to meet the requirements needed to recruit them. However, you'll eventually also fall into a repetitive loop of recycled objectives and dialogue set in all-too-familiar areas, albeit with different voice overs. This repetition also makes London feel a bit small, considering the amount of ground you'll have to retread constantly. As engaging as it is to constantly bounce around characters, over time, Legion's many wacky excursions can also give rise to periods of aimlessness without a centralized viewpoint and structure to guide you.Watch Dogs: Legion does a lot to confront topics like fascism, inequality, and the idea that new technology exposes and amplifies old fears and hatred.And while these characters have great personalities on the surface, they can appear mismatched for the moment and context of what's happening. This can lead to some unexpected and bizarre shifts in tone. For example, during one of the game's more haunting plot threads, DedSec unearths an underground organ-harvesting operation, with its products coming from kidnapped immigrants who are kept in a detainment camp located within London. On its own, this is an incredibly gut-wrenching and profound moment where the game's drama and narrative chops are hitting its highs. However, I made the unfortunate choice of using one of the more flashy characters in the lead-up to this mission--a cosplayer who wears a bright reflective jacket and glowing holographic cat ears. Seeing her walk down the dark and bloody hallways was jarring and undermined the moment. When you couple this with the aimless structure, it can be easy to detach from what's going on or not buy into the sense of urgency the narrative wants you to believe there is.In moments like this, the overall narrative and tonal issues that Watch Dogs: Legion has can force their way to the front of mind, but the core gameplay of hacking the world, making connections, and seeing your favorite operative succeed is satisfying enough that it makes it easier to not get hung up on them. The main story hits some impressive highs during the latter half thanks to the aforementioned Stormzy mission and the podcasts, emails, and even chats with your fellow DedSec members that tackle the heavier subject matter. At its best, Legion manages to stay on message while keeping things fun and exciting. And in some ways, the goofy absurdity of Legion's characters and wacky side activities feels like an appropriate match for the sad absurdity of Legion's world.In the past, Ubisoft has had an unfortunate history of missing the mark when it comes to utilizing real-world events, politics, and other hot-topic issues for the backdrop of their games. However, Watch Dogs: Legion does a lot to confront topics like fascism, inequality, and the idea that new technology exposes and amplifies old fears and hatred. Legion not only does an effective job of showing the banality of evil in plain sight, but also, in a more optimistic light, shows how the citizens look to London's culture and to each other to overcome oppression.Watch Dogs: Legion is an anti-fascist game, and it's admirable that it sticks to that message and sees it through to a satisfying and affirming conclusion.

One of Legion's more profound messages is about what it means to be a true Londoner, and by the game's end, you'll have a DedSec crew made of wildly diverse and disparate citizens from unique cultural, ethnic, and economic backgrounds--all united in their goal to restore their home. If anything, that's as powerful a message for the game as you can get.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nUSgamer, The best of the USgamer team\u2019s content has been archived on VG247.\nDestructoid, dark\u201cThis video game is a work of fiction.

No organization or government agency has approved endorsed or authorized the use of their names or logos or product.\u201dFor some time now, Ubisoft has opened many of its titles with a disclaimer similar to the one above, often placed front and center each time the game in question loads. While a company wanting to \u201ccover its back\u201d is understandable, it gets harder to swallow said message with each release. Ubisoft is heavily invested in narratives concerning political upheaval, corrupt governments, class rebellion, and the breakdown of society. But the publisher\u2019s persistence in distancing itself from the topics it capitalizes on is getting long in the tooth.Ubisoft\u2019s fiction is frequently embedded in recognizable real-world drama.

The story concerns a London that has become a locked-down surveillance state following a tragic night of terrorist bombings, resulting in much death and destruction across the capital. DedSec \u2013 the franchise\u2019s phone-hacking heroes \u2013 have been left holding the bag for this disaster, having been framed by an unknown party known only as \u201cZero Day.\u201dIn the wake of the bombings, the British government has all but abandoned the police force, bringing in paramilitary security firm Albion to handle London\u2019s law enforcement. In the following months, London does become relatively free of crime, but also free of human liberties. Albion, with its army of surveillance drones, its jack-booted soldiers, and its propensity for violence, rules over London with a fascist fist. It\u2019s up to the hackers of DedSec \u2013 now deeper underground than ever before \u2013 to rally the people and bring about freedom, one terabyte at a time.As a narrative concept, Legion sets the stage for an exciting, state-smashing rebellion. Outmanned and outgunned, our ragtag revolutions must use their wits, cunning and technical prowess to research their enemies and bring them down from within, toppling the government and its skull-cracking rent-a-cops using brains over brawn.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b2bde7c-58d9-4e75-9ade-ad241a1d855b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b2bde7c-58d9-4e75-9ade-ad241a1d855b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "814fa392-ec9d-4e24-b580-f21cd3d69e56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b8f3e7f9046f1b641137e2c635f80f6f716d9ff1a28dcb38760ab86b364fab73"}, "3": {"node_id": "22de05d9-7a9e-4eb0-9ef7-1b9950d12eeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3ba506741adf6bbe56120e312d94c74803fd6a4c22edc6387602bb9c3bc51b0"}}, "hash": "f6f3ca411c9cc790692adec6457869c4092bfd8ba26cfccb1713a362d2d2c759", "text": "But in reality, Legion translates this \u201cVive La Revolution\u201d spirit into hours of relatively choresome missions, with almost all falling into a formula of Infiltrate, Hack, and Escape.While the narrative persists in telling you that you\u2019re being the Trojan Horse that\u2019s bringing down a regime, it\u2019s hard to feel like 007 when you\u2019re repeatedly driving to locations, meeting a dude, driving somewhere else, opening a few doors, and hacking a terminal. While Legion is certainly peppered with its fair share of vehicular mayhem and head-popping gunfights, for the most part the campaign consists of a queue of mundane missions, often leaving the player feeling like they\u2019re performing odd-jobs rather than taking down a dangerous dystopia. On a mission-by-mission basis, Legion is\u2026 fine, but it\u2019s startling just how quickly gameplay becomes stagnant. The very first mission, before the credits have even rolled, is a \u201chold off enemy waves while a hack takes place\u201d set-piece, setting the tone for the familiarity ahead.The fresh element that Legion brings to the party \u2013 as its title suggests \u2013 is the concept of playing as a gathering of mismatched rebels, rather than a singular protagonist. Players seek out recruits to the cause while traversing the streets. Simply find a disfranchised Londoner, perform a short mission for them, and you have another DedSeccer on your squad. Each character brings their own set of skills to the urban war \u2013 perhaps they have access to certain weaponry, or a special drone, maybe they have legal skills to free your jailed teammates, or are a bit handy with the ol\u2019 one-two. Legion\u2018s hook lies in the player building a bespoke party of operatives to ensure that, as a collective, DedSec has the skills on deck to tackle any situation.It\u2019s a solid concept, but unfortunately, the idea promises more than it delivers. For the most part, save for a few specific technical traits, very few revolutionaries are required in DedSec\u2019s efforts to liberate London. A team of unique protagonists with individual abilities, skills, and perks is a great, Mission: Impossible-type idea, but in reality, the gimmick is mostly superfluous. Almost everyone you bag is, ultimately, more than capable of dealing with the majority of encounters.Ironically, the lack of a true \u201clead\u201d actually hurts Legion\u2018s immersion. Despite his iconic hat, Aiden Pearce was an insufferable bore, but stripped of the charisma of characters such as Watch Dogs 2\u2019s Marcus Holloway and his hipster kidz, Legion leaves us with a band of mostly interchangeable nobodies. This often leaves player characters feeling hollow and NPC-like, rather than a passionate posse of freedom fighters. Case in point: the first character to draw any real emotion from me was a sad, broken Spiderbot, still trying its very best to be useful despite its pitiful state. Godspeed, little Spiderbot.This dissonance affects Legion\u2018s campaign in multiple ways. Everybody had a chuckle at the \u201cspy granny\u201d trailer \u2013 sure \u2013 but in reality, this party rarely feels like an undercover, state-breaking unit. I was able to play half the game as a lofty, high society woman \u2013 Ascot hat, lace gloves, heels, the works \u2013 who I\u2019m supposed to buy is also a stunt driving specialist, an expert gunslinger, and can take down waves of special forces agents in hand-to-hand combat like she\u2019s Amanda Nunes.It\u2019s a juxtaposition that Legion struggles with for its duration. One minute you\u2019re being told immigrants are being kidnapped and butchered for their organs, and the next Miss Money-Sterling and her Chanel suit just won a pit-fighting tournament on the dark web. Titles such as Grand Theft Auto and Saint\u2019s Row get away with blending their dark violence with off-the-wall wackiness due to their satirical, stylized worlds. But Watch Dogs\u2018 narrative is so\u00a0grim and po-faced, rolling out themes of police brutality, human trafficking, terrorist atrocities, and political fascism, that it doesn\u2019t earn the same tonal conflict.Where Watch Dogs: Legion does put one in the net, however, is in the incredible work done in recreating The Big Smoke. The London of Legion is stunningly authentic and brilliantly detailed, from the bright lights of Piccadilly Circus and the pomp of Buckingham Palace and Big Ben to the grimier underbelly rarely shown when U.S. sitcoms do an obligatory vacation episode.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22de05d9-7a9e-4eb0-9ef7-1b9950d12eeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "22de05d9-7a9e-4eb0-9ef7-1b9950d12eeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b2bde7c-58d9-4e75-9ade-ad241a1d855b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6f3ca411c9cc790692adec6457869c4092bfd8ba26cfccb1713a362d2d2c759"}, "3": {"node_id": "23669a38-0c2a-42d0-960b-e078f0c6a7e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "18a12a9199d207bc23d1105f265edcd336167d586fbf469f295e8b9e3055ba31"}}, "hash": "c3ba506741adf6bbe56120e312d94c74803fd6a4c22edc6387602bb9c3bc51b0", "text": "sitcoms do an obligatory vacation episode. The developers have done an amazing job in replicating the bustling metropolis of modern London, tweaking it just enough to make the city feel that little bit more dangerous \u2013 a nightmarish vision that feels depressingly plausible.Equally as effective are Legion\u2018s visual effects, featuring some of the best color, lighting, shadow, and weather effects we\u2019ve seen in an open-world title since Batman: Arkham Knight. The Watch Dogs: Legion vista more than holds its own against the impending next-generation in both shine and scale. By comparison, the city\u2019s inhabitants are a little rougher around the edges visually \u2013 and feature a wide spectrum of voice-acting ranging from solid to hilarious. At one point I had a construction worker on my squad with the face of a 30-year-old but the voice of an 80-year-old.Legion ran acceptably on PS4 Pro but was still fettered with small, irritating bugs. While the reported save corruption and Xbox-bricking flaws have now apparently been fixed, I still encountered multiple issues. These include unresponsive button prompts, missions failing to trigger/end, two full crashes, and endless NPC oddities, such as a screaming woman having a fight in the street with nobody\u2026 Come to think of it, maybe that just added to the city\u2019s overall authenticity.Watch Dogs: Legion certainly isn\u2019t a bad game by any stretch, but rarely is it engaging, and it is hardly ever simply \u201cfun.\u201d Despite its multi-man concepts and intriguing narrative, Legion slots into the Ubisoft oeuvre of sequels, bringing little new to the table and feeling repetitious a mere third into its 20-30 hour run-time. Watch Dogs: Legion is as serviceable as a-n-other open-world crime sim, only really hitting highs when the player steps away from the main thread to spread a little extra-curricular chaos.As a new generation of gaming dawns, one can\u2019t help but wonder what Ubisoft has planned for its flagship franchises. It appears that the Rainbow Six team is already taking initiative and switching things up with the upcoming Rainbow Six: Quarantine. But what of the Assassin\u2019s Creeds, Far Crys, and Watch Dogs of the world? In the latter\u2019s case, it feels like the well is running dry, and if DedSec are intent on Hacking the Planet into the next decade, then they might need to download some new tricks.For all its themes of rule-breaking anarchy, Watch Dogs: Legion toes the line as a formulaic, though ambitious, open-world adventure. While it boasts one of the most visually exciting and stunningly authentic locales in the genre\u2019s history, Watch Dogs: Legion\u2018s gameplay is mechanical, over-familiar, and repetitive, struggling to capture the exciting promise of a fist-pumping, system-smashing revolution.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]AlrightSlightly above average or simply inoffensive.

There are hooligans who can rally a faction of drunk football fans to fight alongside them, old men whose farts or hiccups alert enemies to their presence, and even unfortunate souls who will spontaneously die for no good reason. It\u2019s tremendous fun, despite recurring problems we\u2019ve come to expect from Ubisoft games occasionally threatening to derail the experience.Watch Dogs: Legion once again sees anarchist hacker group DedSec trying to overthrow a shady, corrupt organization, this time taking on Albion, a militarized police force that has a stranglehold on England\u2019s capital city. DedSec seeks to take down Albion by way of recruiting London\u2019s populace, with each recruited \u2018Operative\u2019 having their own unique set of skills they bring to the table.Operatives are brought into your DedSec team by way of tapping into their phone and then embarking on a special recruitment mission. Each of these unique missions involves a favor they need carrying out, whether that\u2019s stealing an ambulance of drugs or hacking into a server to delete sensitive information. After completion of the recruitment mission, you can immediately begin playing as your new Operative, transforming an NPC into a player-character.Given the ludicrous nature of this gimmick, I had anticipated that Ubisoft would cut several corners in order to implement it. Surely there couldn\u2019t be\u00a0that\u00a0much difference between playable characters?\u00a0However, I was routinely surprised by just how much detail has gone into making this feature a reality, from the unique abilities given to each NPC through to their distinguishable personalities and voiceovers.Not only does each Operative come with their own abilities, from a tech bro able to take control of an electrified shock drone through to a beekeeper who can send swarms of robotic bees to take down enemies, but they have their own personalities and voice lines, too. During missions, your recruited team of Operatives will call one another, offering their own take on your objectives. It\u2019s limited\u00a0\u2014 you shouldn\u2019t expect too many divergent personalities or any renegade recruits among your ranks\u00a0\u2014 but there\u2019s enough variety to make each Operative distinguishable from the last.However, the same cannot be said for Watch Dogs Legion\u2018s cast of villains. Like\u00a0Watch Dogs 2\u00a0and many other Ubisoft games before it,\u00a0Legion\u00a0crucially suffers from a disparity between gameplay and tone. The brutally evil selection of antagonists you face off against show no signs of humanity, with you being offered brief yet jarring insights into their staggeringly cruel machinations, before hopping back into\u00a0Legion\u2018s weird open-world of spider robots and farting grandmothers.Legion\u00a0is another example of Ubisoft struggling to tread the line between telling a compelling story and ensuring it still makes for a fun game. Some truly heinous acts are committed in front of DedSec\u2019s eyes, yet these moments are so frequently over-the-top that they fail to be memorable. Each villain is more cartoonishly dastardly than the last, so when one fascistic tech genius turns their relative into an AI supercomputer, it isn\u2019t as impactful as this plot point would seem on paper.The limited interactions with its core antagonists felt like I was on a\u00a0whistle-stop tour of the most heinous elements of modern society, from racism through to human trafficking, with Ubisoft packing all of their villains\u2019 evil into a few cutscenes. It\u2019s overwhelming and ultimately resulted in me tuning out mentally in order to enjoy its ludicrous world, which is where\u00a0Watch Dogs: Legion\u00a0is at its best.With Watch Dogs: Legion,\u00a0Ubisoft has created arguably its most vibrant, lively open-world yet.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2aa0ac32-b7f7-462d-a8d9-d558740aad77": {"__data__": {"id_": "2aa0ac32-b7f7-462d-a8d9-d558740aad77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "23669a38-0c2a-42d0-960b-e078f0c6a7e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "18a12a9199d207bc23d1105f265edcd336167d586fbf469f295e8b9e3055ba31"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cdd8e19-8e0a-4e14-b2ce-090b26cc4a0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "583b7f58236e000033e65e4917a2667a6066ef1493c0e1108b245c508dabc908"}}, "hash": "aaf4c56fd935be80128190c8c80a26db8f0b96ae674009946f97106946ede4d1", "text": "London is an impressive not-too-futuristic recreation of the capital, with every major location and landmark changed just enough to fit into its cyberpunk aesthetic, yet not so much that it\u2019s unfamiliar. It\u2019s unusual for an English city to be a setting in a modern blockbuster game, so I was taken aback when I realized I was walking down streets that were immediately recognizable to me as a UK citizen rather than a block in far-flung San Francisco or LA.A great deal of time has clearly been put into voiceovers that are reflective of the multicultural setting. While some of these accents can be hit and miss\u00a0\u2014 I was not a fan of the middle-aged, white babysitter who insisted on using \u201cbrrrap!\u201d to convey her excitement\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s impressive that there are so many different options and characters from such different backgrounds. However, in a tumultuous 2020 for Ubisoft in which allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct have been leveled at the company, DedSec\u2019s goal of an egalitarian society feels at odds with what we\u2019ve heard of\u00a0its creator\u2019s real-world company culture. While Ubisoft has claimed it is working to resolve these internal issues, that\u00a0Legion\u00a0is its first major release since these revelations causes its efforts towards representation to feel quite hollow.And while\u00a0Watch Dogs: Legion\u00a0is a tremendously good-looking game,\u00a0it\u2019s clear that its sheer scale\u00a0pushed my Xbox One X to its limits, with its frame rate occasionally dipping below the 30 FPS mark and the game suffering from some hard crashes. While these only happened a handful of times, it\u2019s worth mentioning and will hopefully be rectified in a post-launch patch. This problem wasn\u2019t experienced by my colleagues playing the game on PC, and it\u2019s unclear if the PS5 or Xbox Series X versions would therefore face the same issues, too.I was also taken aback by how these characters are integrated into the wider world after you analyze or recruit them. During one car chase, I drove down an alleyway only to narrowly avoid hitting an Operative I had failed to recruit hours earlier. Rather than being a dropbox of randomized and interchangeable NPCs, these characters continue to live in London even after you\u2019re finished with them, and there\u2019s the possibility you\u2019ll find them roaming the streets as a result. You can also anger potential recruits and cause them to lash out with your currently enlisted batch of Operatives\u00a0\u2014 one bare-knuckle fighter working for a criminal gang kidnapped my favorite character, and I was then tasked with a mission to go and rescue her from a hideout.These Operatives organically blend into Watch Dogs: Legion\u2018s open-world as seamlessly as its hacking, which has received an abundance of additions and improvements this time around. Drones hovering above can be hijacked, disabled, and forced to betray the enemy, you can send vehicles crashing off the road during high-speed pursuits, and you can utilize a combination of your special gadgets to infiltrate any enemy-controlled building. For pacifist players, a non-lethal playthrough is more of a possibility than ever, with most Operatives coming armed with a fast-firing stun gun and a slew of tech allowing you to take down enemies without having to kill them.But while there is plenty of variety in the Operatives you can control and the abilities they have at their disposal, the loop of infiltrating buildings and hacking enemies can grow repetitive.\u00a0Watch Dogs: Legion\u00a0excels when you\u2019re able to use some ridiculous ability to forge your own shortcut in a mission, but there are so many abilities that Ubisoft is inevitably unable to take full advantage of a number of them. As such, many missions are best carried out by turning yourself invisible and hacking a bunch of cameras, abilities which are available to every character.Despite its issues, considering just how many variables there are in\u00a0Watch Dogs: Legion, it\u2019s a wonder that it works as well as it does. It\u2019s Pokemon but with people, with the player wandering around London and \u201ccatching\u201d weird and wonderful Operatives to add to their unlikely team of hackers. Its story may be tonally inconsistent in typical Ubisoft fashion, but it\u2019s best enjoyed with your brain taking the backseat while your hiccuping drunk super-spy takes the wheel. While another cyberpunk game might do the genre\u2019s themes more justice later this year, Watch Dogs: Legion\u2018s beautiful London and its array of recruitable denizens make it one of the most enjoyable games of the year.Watch Dogs: Legion reviewed by GameRevolution on Xbox One.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cdd8e19-8e0a-4e14-b2ce-090b26cc4a0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cdd8e19-8e0a-4e14-b2ce-090b26cc4a0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "2aa0ac32-b7f7-462d-a8d9-d558740aad77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aaf4c56fd935be80128190c8c80a26db8f0b96ae674009946f97106946ede4d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a4df03c-3bd7-409d-99f5-ed5798de392e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0415d22cd3806fcb5b4ec6c1430cc32740b25ca264b70e915d74968585d6218e"}}, "hash": "583b7f58236e000033e65e4917a2667a6066ef1493c0e1108b245c508dabc908", "text": "Code provided by publisher.8Paul Tamburro is Editorial Manager at Evolve Media and an Editor-in-Chief of GameRevolution, ComingSoon, PlayStation LifeStyle, and SuperHeroHype.Share article\nShacknews, New to Shacknews?

Our review.Watch Dogs is still relatively young in the pantheon of ongoing AAA game franchises. It also happens to be one that has struggled to find its footing. 2014\u2019s Watch Dogs received lukewarm responses from both critics and fans, and Watch Dogs 2 also underperformed, despite a much more positive critical response. Watch Dogs: Legion is the third outing for Ubisoft\u2019s open-world hacking franchise, and it\u2019s the developer\u2019s biggest swing yet.\u00a0Watch Dogs: Legion leaves the United States behind in favor of a European setting. Taking place in the bustling city of London, Watch Dogs: Legion once again follows the hacker group DedSec, this time fighting to clear their name. Following a terrorist attack on Parliament, DedSec is falsely accused as the perpetrating party, leading to harsher surveillance laws being enacted, and a large portion of London\u2019s population seeing DedSec as a terrorist group.\u00a0Now, players are tasked with rebuilding DedSec\u2019s ranks, and must recruit characters from all walks of life via the new \u201cplay as anyone\u201d mechanic. It\u2019s a story that delves into political intrigue, drama, and betrayal. The simple question of \u201cwho was really behind the Zero Day attack?\u201d is one that kept me guessing until the very end. While it lacks the emotional swing of Watch Dogs 2, it\u2019s a pretty solid story following our favorite group of hackers.\u00a0The focal selling point of Watch Dogs: Legion is its \u201cplay as anyone\u201d mechanic. Unlike past entries in the series, Watch Dogs: Legion has no set protagonist. Instead, players are able to recruit practically any NPC they come across and play as them, allowing anybody to be the hero.\u00a0Being able to play as anybody truly delivers on the promise of Watch Dogs. Since Aiden Pearce first took to the streets in the original game, players have been able to scan and hack data on any character, revealing unique personal information and details about any given citizen. However, this was always a feature that never went further than the occasional laugh. In Watch Dogs: Legion, a character\u2019s occupation and hobbies are directly tied to how they play.\u00a0If an NPC is a construction worker, recruiting them may yield a nail gun weapon, as well as a personal cargo drone that players can summon to lift themselves into the skies. This will also allow players to enter areas restricted to construction workers without having to sneak and hide behind cover.\u00a0It\u2019s the integration of this feature that makes Watch Dogs: Legion a blast. During my playthrough, I saw an Albion officer (Watch Dogs: Legion\u2019s militarized police force) harassing folks on the corner of a busy street. With his occupation, he already had a negative view on DedSec. After diving into his profile, I discovered that somebody was blackmailing him with some personal information. I went and found the blackmailer, erased their files, deeming them powerless over the aforementioned Albion officer. After learning what I\u2019d done for him, the officer was no longer negative towards DedSec. I was then able to recruit him into the hacker group.That Albion officer became my go-to character for nearly the entire Albion arc of missions in the Watch Dogs: Legion campaign. I\u2019d simply walk right into any heavily protected facility, just needing to act natural in order to keep my cover. It completely transformed the way I approached any Albion mission.\u00a0This is how Watch Dogs: Legion shines. The franchise has always given players the power of choice, letting them run into a mission with guns blazing, or completing the same mission without ever setting foot in restricted territory or harming a soul. Play as anyone takes this concept and multiplies it by 50. I found myself constantly swapping between characters in order to find whatever DedSec operative was best suited for a given mission.\u00a0What I found fascinating was Watch Dogs: Legion\u2019s permadeath mode. Players can toggle this on, meaning that any operative killed in combat is gone forever. To up the stakes, players can turn on Iron Man mode, which locks the campaign in permadeath. If all operatives are killed and there\u2019s nobody remaining, game over. You\u2019re done.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a4df03c-3bd7-409d-99f5-ed5798de392e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a4df03c-3bd7-409d-99f5-ed5798de392e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cdd8e19-8e0a-4e14-b2ce-090b26cc4a0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "583b7f58236e000033e65e4917a2667a6066ef1493c0e1108b245c508dabc908"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5900290-3d73-4267-b46d-f01ac1852387", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8106b2b42539bdf5f077bbfb86800e7afb72a80606b59bf3501c2bcaceccffe7"}}, "hash": "0415d22cd3806fcb5b4ec6c1430cc32740b25ca264b70e915d74968585d6218e", "text": "You\u2019re done. Playing on Iron Man mode raised the stakes exponentially, as I couldn\u2019t allow myself to be careless when approaching any given mission scenario.The characters also have unique interactions with others based on background. While playing as a famous livestreamer, passerbys would say things like \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan!\u201d or, \u201cI love your work!\u201d When strolling around as my Albion officer, other members would give a head nod or ask how my day is going. These same officers would shove or potentially try to arrest me if I got too close while playing as different operatives. It\u2019s an attention to detail that makes London feel alive and immersive.\u00a0As great as the play as anyone mechanic is for gameplay, it takes a bit of the luster away from the story. In Watch Dogs 2, we got emotionally invested in characters like Marcus and Wrench, wary about how their stories would end. In Watch Dogs: Legion, it\u2019s hard to develop a personal attachment to any one character, as they\u2019re essentially NPCs that you assign to fill slots in the story. While it\u2019s extremely fun and silly to see my paintballing street artist in cutscenes with powerful politicians and rich moguls, I never felt that emotional investment that I got in previous games.It doesn\u2019t help that there are a ton of reused faces, further eliminating the sense of individuality in several of the characters. This was made worse due to facial animations being a bit robotic when watching NPCs speak during cutscenes.Gameplay in Watch Dogs: Legion is once again a balance between traditional firearms and technology. Players can hack cameras and drones to get behind closed doors and either complete objectives or scout locations. Legion adds a brand new controllable gadget to the hacking series - the spiderbot. This eight-legged robot can be used to infiltrate restricted locations and hack physical circuits. It can even stealthily take down enemies along the way. The spiderbot quickly became my favorite tool in Watch Dogs: Legion, as I prefer to keep my character out of the danger, letting the bots and drones do all of the heavy lifting.\u00a0As for weapons, players will no longer go to a store and buy the equipment of their choosing. Instead, recruiting operatives with their own personal weapons will allow other members of DedSec to equip them, given they\u2019re able to use that item class. For example, the secret spy I recruited to my team used a silenced pistol, which I couldn\u2019t access by any other means. This incentivizes players to get out into the world and add more characters to their ranks.\u00a0In the open-world of London, players will find the city divided into different boroughs. Each borough has different uprising tasks that will turn public favor towards DedSec. These tasks can be vandalizing propaganda, photographing evidence, or rescuing arrested freedom fighters. Completing all of the uprising tasks will unlock a special recruitment mission for one of several unique operatives. These agents come with rare bonuses, like a car that shoots missiles, or a personal attack drone.\u00a0More or less, the boroughs and their subsequent tasks are Watch Dogs: Legion\u2019s take on Ubisoft\u2019s common open-world formula. However, there\u2019s only 3-4 tasks per area, so it never feels like I\u2019m being bombarded with busy work just to light up more dots on a map. Plus, turning a borough will make the citizens in that area more fond of DedSec, making it easier to recruit operatives.Watch Dogs: Legion is undoubtedly the most fun and exciting entry in the series. Play as anyone is a mechanic that really elevates the gameplay experience, truly delivering on the core premise of the franchise. The campaign is solid, though it lacks the emotional investment and standout characters of previous series entries.

I really enjoyed it, but the quests got old. I skipped Far Cry and Odyssey. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAssuming it hasn't changed much from Watch Dogs 2, Legion will be a more compact experience than AC: Origins.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tgot it for free through the nvidia promo so will probably try it out... didn't care for the first one but the second was good fun.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYeah if you at least moderately like WD2, I'm confident you'll have fun with Legion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow's the variety of recruitment-related missions in the game?\r Not that it really matters to me at this point, since I already own the game, but I'm curious, and it might be relevant to someone else.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's fairly solid. There's a range of character backgrounds and stories behind how/why you're recruiting them. That being said, most missions come down to you going to a restricted area to delete/download/steal something. There is unique dialogue for a lot of recruitment missions too, which I thought was neat.\t\t\t\t\nVG247, Let\u2019s get one thing clear before I begin my review: as a Scot, I\u2019m pretty disenfranchised with the world\u2019s London-centric view of Britain and as such, have never been particularly excited about visiting the capital. It goes without saying, then, that playing a game that takes place in a pretty realistic version of London wasn\u2019t very alluring to me, despite being able to send all my recruits to Westminster to give the finger at the fictional but probably Tory incumbent Prime Minister in-game.Watch Dogs: Legion captures the gargantuan scope of London, with its sprawling Boroughs, the well-connected transport system - which is your Fast Travel method throughout - and how intimidating it can feel stepping off a train into an area you\u2019ve only ever seen on TV. \n \nMuch like real life, though, you become familiarised with the different Boroughs and what they hold quite quickly. The puddles and crappy roads all start to look the same, you accidentally look at a person for too long and get called a cockwomble and before you know it, you\u2019re a Londoner.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "937ac03a-8ab3-4100-8f13-ec005297ba49": {"__data__": {"id_": "937ac03a-8ab3-4100-8f13-ec005297ba49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "a5900290-3d73-4267-b46d-f01ac1852387", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8106b2b42539bdf5f077bbfb86800e7afb72a80606b59bf3501c2bcaceccffe7"}, "3": {"node_id": "81ee7615-46a1-459d-b2be-1d27e7ea9956", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "089fa306710aff62c28d3daa8efc87cf4223f123702ef3117aeeeee7e6837d00"}}, "hash": "f85e5a7550e76df4d238c0873ee3bbbd9c5365e5abb66b815a22d184b6d25d2e", "text": "The main thread of connection that runs through the entirety of Watch Dogs: Legion is that we are all Londoners and as such, we should all band together to throw off our various tech-obsessed, narcissistic and violent overlords.Watch Dogs: Legion begins with a terrorist group known only as Zero-Day blowing up various locations around London as a means to show the world that destroying one another and lessening our reliance on technology is the only way to save humanity. As it turns out, everyone from the baddies from Clan Kelley to the government\u2019s own military police was in on it, so it reads a little like a QAnon expo. Pretty grim, right? Playing as a newly-obtained DedSec recruit, you\u2019re tasked by its leader, Sabine, to rebuild the resistance against the likes of Albion, London\u2019s militaristic new police force, Mary Kelley and her crime syndicate and Skye Larsen, Broca Tech\u2019s mysterious CEO. It\u2019s worth noting that the majority of Leaders in Watch Dogs: Legion are women, which feels a little forced at points. While it\u2019s good to see effective female leadership with the likes of Nowt and her 404 hacker group and Inspector Kaitlin Lau\u2019s valiant efforts to uphold the good hand of the law, the women in charge of enemy groups are downright horrifying. \n \nThere\u2019s poignant negativity in the air as you pass anti-government protests, food banks and pro-refugee groups, all of which are relevant in a time where our own politicians are voting to not feed children and treat refugees and immigrants as criminals. There are also a few indirect references to the ongoing pandemic and political crisis in Britain that are uncomfortably close to home, which I daresay made this review all the more difficult. You can buy face masks at several shops and there are a few NPC quips near the beginning like \u201cAt least the restrictions have been lifted!\u201d that prompts a dark laugh. While it\u2019s in reference to a sort of martial law being lifted, it\u2019s still a very solemn nod to current events. The government is useless, a military police force runs around unchecked, the rich are getting richer and exploiting the poor and sick - all of the events in Watch Dogs: Legion don\u2019t seem that far removed from our own reality and the various conspiracy theories being touted on Facebook.  It\u2019s difficult not to feel complete despair as you journey through this violent, dystopian nightmare that plays on a lot of existing conspiracy theories. I\u2019m grateful that at least for now, nobody seems to be trying to implant a control chip into my brain in real life. But then again, what about the connection between the 5G towers and Coronavirus? Sorry, I forgot you wanted to keep politics out of your games. \n \nTechnology is supposedly at the forefront of Watch Dogs: Legion, but its range is rather limited. There are a few bots and drones you can control - the Spiderbot will be your best friend after an hour or two of playing - a few cloaking devices and weapons upgrades, and that\u2019s kind of it. Each piece of Tech has three upgrade levels, letting you create a silenced weapon or have the ability to shield yourself for a few moments longer, but the scope is nowhere near what I imagined.The same goes for recruiting folk - you can\u2019t actually recruit everyone as there\u2019s a limit on how many recruitment missions you can hold at a time and for the most part, the majority of people wandering about London are pretty boring. The best candidates are those with better hacking capabilities, as you\u2019ll spend 90% of your time trying to figuring out how to open doors.While it\u2019s quite fun to hack cameras, set traps and use the Spiderbot to complete missions via vents and hiding under desks, it all gets a bit samey. The best way to shake things up is to take in a recruit with no other redeemable qualities except \u201cskills\u201d like Flatulence and Hiccups that make them easier to detect and see what happens.  \n \nThe storylines for each Faction start off well - a quick but fairly thorough introduction to each leader, their Faction\u2019s function and current status and why DedSec is staunchly against them. Skye\u2019s storyline, in particular, is scary and unnerving but, like all good things in Watch Dogs: Legion, comes to a very abrupt end after only a few missions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81ee7615-46a1-459d-b2be-1d27e7ea9956": {"__data__": {"id_": "81ee7615-46a1-459d-b2be-1d27e7ea9956", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "937ac03a-8ab3-4100-8f13-ec005297ba49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f85e5a7550e76df4d238c0873ee3bbbd9c5365e5abb66b815a22d184b6d25d2e"}, "3": {"node_id": "98c84e2c-91fb-4318-8fb3-4578a6294ff5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5fba871780b2434827a2bbbc494856ea9df540314da01ceae596dc7531bdd09"}}, "hash": "089fa306710aff62c28d3daa8efc87cf4223f123702ef3117aeeeee7e6837d00", "text": "You\u2019re constantly left wanting more, and not in a good way.Each mission type is incredibly formulaic: help someone\u2019s friend from being extorted by the Kelleys, break into a restricted area and rescue someone, use the Spiderbot and cameras to complete a convoluted electrical circuit puzzle to turn a machine on - you get the idea. Missions are endlessly repetitive, even if you switch it up and go against DedSec\u2019s non-violent approach with guns blazing. The Uniformed Access mechanic doesn\u2019t work nearly as well as it should and made missions even more laborious than usual. Apparently, no one who works in a place as big as London has clicked that you might see different employees every other day - it would seem that redeployment doesn\u2019t exist in this particular dystopian London.Simply put, Watch Dogs: Legion is pretty empty. While it\u2019s claimed that voice modulation is used to make each recruit sound unique, there are maybe just over a half dozen different accents I\u2019ve discovered at most. Unsurprisingly, the two Scottish characters I encountered were affiliated with enemy groups, proving that even in the end times, we are miserable bastards. \n \nThe difficulty suddenly ramps up after the 404 and Skye Larson storylines and you\u2019re suddenly expected to take part in numerous gunfights and complete Spiderbot and Drone challenges. Despite this uptick, the same new mission style is repeated over and over and it follows a bit of a strange pattern. Expect to go into a quiet area, fart around with a computer and enjoy a cheeky bit of banter from your AI pal Bagley before loads of enemies spawn from the corners. You\u2019ll need to clear the area of enemies who\u2019ve decided to fight you - even though you\u2019ve already completed the task, so it's more like a combat section that's been chucked in for the sake of it - before returning to the previous area and making a dash for all those aforementioned opened doors.  Paradoxically, by being all show with no substance, Watch Dogs: Legion encapsulates exactly what I feel about London: there\u2019s lots of jostling for power, everyone wants to be in it to experience something and feel important but instead you feel lonely, disconnected and everything is a bit overdone and pointless. To complete my tourist\u2019s experience, I decked out one of my characters in a full Union Jack outfit, because there\u2019s nothing young British people love more than wearing flags, right down to the gloves.  \n \nFor all of these reasons, Watch Dogs: Legion gets a 3 out of 5. Watch Dogs fans and more die-hard anarchists among you might enjoy it more, but between the short storylines, underwhelming tech and mission types and the general \u201ceverything is on fire\u201d vibe, it just doesn\u2019t rate highly for me.

Still, Watch Dogs: Legion earns points for weaving together a coherent open-world game where no one is the protagonist and everyone is the protagonist at the same time.Legion takes players to a version of London that has been utterly transformed in the well-established techno-dystopian near-future of the Watch Dogs universe. Things start off with a literal bang when a terrorist hacker collective known as Zero Day sets off a series of massive explosions around the city. Dedsec, the \"good guy\" hackers from previous Watch Dogs titles, gets framed for the attacks, leading the city to grant sweeping police state powers to mercenary mega-firm Albion in the name of \"security.\"Dedsec's membership is quickly decimated by deportations and killings under this new regime. As one of the last remaining members, it's up to the player to recruit new members to Dedsec and fight back against Zero Day, Albion, and other tangential criminal and government groups in their orbit.That recruitment process, as presented in Legion, requires the player to suspend more than a little bit of disbelief. You can go up to literally any random person in the game, push a button, and start a completely unprompted conversation about potentially violent overthrow of the system.                                            \nAdvertisement", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "360044e2-6418-4584-be7b-d44fbccbc419": {"__data__": {"id_": "360044e2-6418-4584-be7b-d44fbccbc419", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "98c84e2c-91fb-4318-8fb3-4578a6294ff5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5fba871780b2434827a2bbbc494856ea9df540314da01ceae596dc7531bdd09"}, "3": {"node_id": "92455a46-f905-4c77-a885-154aefa02109", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc085e01977e38f9a129eb31f0bfce890caadfe1bf4ac1357b2e46a8db6e6600"}}, "hash": "1c56fd6e39ab22d62213bf16cadf09751d28324bd30ebd9c045f98b80219f18e", "text": "Almost without fail, that person will be instantly on board with joining Dedsec's shadowy, distributed hacker collective. Only, could you help them out with a quick problem (read: side quest) first? Forget about the hard sell, in the London of Watch Dog: Legion, everyone seems just inches away from joining the resistance in exchange for a simple favor.You also have to accept that the random assemblage of average citizens you recruit are ready to immediately become the master spies, hackers, and counter-mercenaries needed to take down this entrenched fascist system. Sure, there are some potential recruits whose backstories provide them access to special skills or high-octane firepower\u2014uniformed officers, for instance, can walk around sensitive areas without being instantly noticed as out of place.But even the most out-of-shape, underskilled schmoe on the street still has to have the basic ability to perform the stealthy infiltrations and complex hacks that form the basis of the game. Once again, you just have to suspend your disbelief more than a little bit to buy into the game's core concept.Once you can accept that premise, though, this conceit creates a veritable explosion in the diversity of character choices in the game. My Dedsec cell looks like a true melting pot of London society in terms of race, gender, and even class. Forming a team where a college professor and chess champion can fight for the same goals as a cockney-speaking construction worker (who takes out enemies with a giant lug wrench) feels refreshingly cosmopolitan, especially as one character gets immediately called in to help when the other fails.These characters aren't just interchangeable ciphers, either. Each one has their own personality that comes through in the fully voiced lines they deliver during the game's many cut-scenes and mid-mission conversations. While the overall story plays out the same no matter who you're controlling, individual conversations can play out very differently depending on what character happens to be the current protagonist.Unfortunately, the seams for this system do show through in many places. In conversational cut scenes, your character's model often falls into an uncanny valley of standing awkwardly and making semi-random facial expressions in response to their partner (oddly timed changes in camera angle don't help in these situations).The intonations behind your character's lines often feel just a bit off, too, like they were cut and pasted from a set of generic responses rather than from an actor responding to a specific story beat. That's a shame, because the few named characters that can't be controlled by the player generally give pretty good and nuanced performances\u2014the foul-mouthed, joke-cracking AI assistant Bagley is a particular standout.Still, it's a wonder that this system of interchangeable player characters works at all. Despite the warts, building your own ragtag group of resistance fighters from across society makes a strong statement about the power of collective action that would be hard to get across in another medium.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

The terrorist versus terrorist conflict that forms the spine of the story sees villainous anarchist group Zero Day facing off against Robin Hood outfit DedSec, as a spate of recent bombings by the former has given rise to Albion, a Private Military Company that has stepped in to enforce its own brand of totalitarian rule. Once again, Ubisoft denies any political leanings or implications in a game that literally bleeds politics. It keeps the real-world analogies to an almost parody-like level, but it\u2019s impossible not to draw parallels to our own less-than-glowing timeline. Seeing people protesting at heritage sites, wearing face masks, generally being oppressed by a government they should be able to trust. I mean, yeah. You know what I mean.And there are elements to Legion\u2019s story that are incredibly dark. Seeing people begging for their lives as they\u2019re beaten into submission by Albion enforcers is never easy to ignore, and I\u2019ve had my Operatives arrested or hospitalised on numerous occasions for stepping in. But then, isn\u2019t that the point? DedSec are supposed to be the good guys, after all. Watch Dogs: Legion touches on a lot of other unsavoury real-world issues, too, such as immigration and human trafficking, the drug trade, cryptocurrency scams, and organised crime. And while these issues are sensationalised simply by dint of being in a videogame, they\u2019re not glorified. Once again, DedSec genuinely are the good guys in this world.Which doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t recruit bad guys, of course. As you travel the streets of our sovereign capital, you can profile everyone you pass with a push of the left bumper. The information mined will tell you their name and occupation, whether they sympathise with DedSec and what kind of special skills, unique weapons, or other assets they can bring to the table. The random logic that puts these various elements together is a little crazy at times, when the friendly gynaecologist in a pinstripe suit apparently owns her own assault rifle, but by and large, these loadouts mostly make sense. And there are tons of them. People from all walks of life populate Legion\u2019s London, and you\u2019ll need a broad spectrum of Operatives to succeed.Construction workers, police, and NHS staff come with their own uniforms to sneak into certain areas; barristers and lawyers can reduce the jail time if your Operatives are arrested. Hitmen, mechanics, spies, teachers, traders, accountants, game developers, artists, celebrities\u2026 All these exist in the game along with many more, and almost all of them bring something useful. A certain tech upgrade even allows you to profile those opposed to DedSec, allowing you to investigate their habits, find their secrets and discover a way to get them on-side. It might be simply erasing a debt record from a fixed server, or it could require you to liberate an imprisoned family member. Pressing RB when profiling a person adds them to the list of potential recruits and allows you to pursue their recruitment mission. You can even turn Albion employees if you know where to poke them.This does create a strange game world, though, one where DedSec itself is the protagonist. Ubisoft has done a good job covering the seams, but they\u2019re there for those who want to find them. For example, most voice lines have been recorded multiple times in a vast array of accents (really, there are so many accents), but occasionally you\u2019ll have an Operative and citizen chatting to each other with the same voice. There are also emergent moments that threaten to trip themselves up. One instance of this came about when I was preparing to recruit a Spy (and you really should; spies in Legion are star players) and I stumbled across his sister being roughed up by Albion. I rescued her, and he immediately joined us, skipping his recruitment mission. I assumed there would be unique dialogue between them so I recruited her and tested it, only to be disappointed when I reunited them and they acted like strangers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4540ed4e-1a60-4184-87db-9f7ee9896550": {"__data__": {"id_": "4540ed4e-1a60-4184-87db-9f7ee9896550", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "92455a46-f905-4c77-a885-154aefa02109", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc085e01977e38f9a129eb31f0bfce890caadfe1bf4ac1357b2e46a8db6e6600"}, "3": {"node_id": "548d9b8a-7a48-49b6-a27f-9bd3c914964f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e24a579809520f9768f78ec192f95ca4f1d61de9b8ee771469f722d746d3bcd5"}}, "hash": "4e30069a77c6cdb7429d52f2032b27219d51d8aa5339cd213bc8c3d66504c414", "text": "I can\u2019t imagine the level of coding needed to create family systems and the amount of unique dialogue it would require, but it still felt like a Chekov\u2019s Gun that no one fired.The primary objective in Watch Dogs: Legion is to liberate eight Boroughs of London by destabilising the three enemy factions: Albion, Clan Kelley, and Zero Day. You do this by destroying propaganda, pasting up protest art, freeing key members of oppressed communities, and hacking databases all over the city. The patented Ubisoft Checklist is at work, but it never felt like I was slogging through anything. You don\u2019t need to level up your Operatives beyond finding Tech Points to unlock and upgrade gadgets and techniques, so none of the content is randomly level-gated, and every Operative has access to at least the basic levels of hacking and combat. You can switch back and forth between members of your team at any time, and there\u2019ll be a brief changeover scene that jarringly shows both characters in their default clothing. You share the same clothes, weapons, and gadgets across your entire team.Having the game set in such a well-realised version of London is pretty awesome, too. Being a Brit, I\u2019ve spent many, many hours in games saving approximations of New York, Miami, LA, Chicago\u2026 It\u2019s nice to be driving through the streets and look up to see Big Ben towering over me, the London Eye shining in the distance, or Westminster Bridge nobly fording the Thames. Not to mention the inclusion of roundabouts and red postboxes. These are things and places I have seen in real life, and it makes a difference while playing. It looks gorgeous too, built with care and detail, and I was often happy to engage Autodrive in a car and take in the sights. A host of side-concerns threaten to distract from the main plot \u2013 all Great British pastimes such as bare-knuckle boxing, playing darts, keepie-uppies in the park, and getting pissed.If one thing really lets it down it\u2019s the voice work. I\u2019m all for diversity and inclusion, and like many big cities, London is a cultural melting pot, but there are so, so many accents. While some of the delivery is very good (I particularly liked some of the radio interviews and podcasts), some of it feels forced. And my god, the swearing. Us Brits are a sweary bunch, for sure, but it seems that there are very few spoken lines in Legion that don\u2019t include an expletive or two.To be utterly fair, the minute-to-minute gameplay is nothing we didn\u2019t see in the previous games, but with added Spiderbots. These little helpers are more useful than the drones you can summon, and the animation on them is stellar. Stealth is very much encouraged but difficult to maintain, though you\u2019re rarely punished for messing up. The authorities are easy to evade at the first notoriety level, and the auto-aim is pretty forgiving if you\u2019re going for headshots. I found the driving to be a little floaty, but on the whole most vehicles handle well enough, especially the bikes. The pedestrian AI does have a tendency to hurl itself directly into your path if you so much as bump up the curb, though, and I saw more than one high-speed chase annihilate a row of parked cars without a hint of my agency. These little moments may be put down to open-world jank, or they may be an indication of just how much is going on behind the scenes.This being the near future, the skies above London are abuzz with drones, capturing the news, delivering parcels, or enforcing the law. Of course, these can all be hacked and either commandeered or disabled. The big cargo drones can be hacked, too, then summoned and ridden around far above the ground, allowing access to higher levels and rooftops. You can also intercept and complete deliveries for Parcel Fox, which rewards you with ETO, the cryptocurrency that has replaced Stirling in Watch Dogs\u2019 world.We should probably thank the debacle around Ghost Recon: Breakpoint for the fact that the monetisation in Legion is so tacked-on that it might as well not exist at all. Obviously Watch Dogs Online is yet to launch and that may change things, but right now there are hundreds of items of clothing you can buy in-game and share between your characters and, while there are Premium Operatives available as pre-order bonuses, they\u2019re completely non-essential to success.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "548d9b8a-7a48-49b6-a27f-9bd3c914964f": {"__data__": {"id_": "548d9b8a-7a48-49b6-a27f-9bd3c914964f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "4540ed4e-1a60-4184-87db-9f7ee9896550", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e30069a77c6cdb7429d52f2032b27219d51d8aa5339cd213bc8c3d66504c414"}, "3": {"node_id": "c889e416-3314-47b3-a9ea-8af81b0f633f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a43bedec15c81471bddba81c9047e29f8a5d78b03cd2bd15dd9c7df51fbf009"}}, "hash": "e24a579809520f9768f78ec192f95ca4f1d61de9b8ee771469f722d746d3bcd5", "text": "A far cry from Breakpoint\u2019s ridiculous storefront.Perhaps most importantly \u2013 at least to me \u2013 is the fact that there have only been maybe two or three other games this year that I\u2019ve enjoyed playing as much as Watch Dogs: Legion. It has its fair share of Ubisoft jank here and there, and the check-box structure will certainly cause a few eyes to roll, but the people who are likely to buy this game will already know what to expect in terms of quality and quantity, and I think even those people may be pleasantly surprised by just how good Legion is, and how much fun it is to exist in this world.The Operative system is excellent\nEntertaining throughout\nA great approximation of London\nLoads to doSome voice acting is a bit off\nOccasional open world bugs\nTone can be inconsistentWatch Dogs: Legion suffers from a little jank in the tank, but the recruitment system is fantastic and there's just so much to see and do. The open world is full of detail, and the whole experience is full of heart. Your home for all your videogame needs. Reviews, videos, podcast, news: we\u2019ve got the lot: PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox, PC Gaming!\nAttack of the Fanboy, Watch Dogs: Legion is the definition of quantity over quality. Watch Dogs: Legion lets you recruit anyone right off the street and add them to your team of DedSec Operatives. You can cultivate a fully custom team of hackers to suit your playstyle. Every citizen of London is entirely unique, each with their own abilities, weapons, and daily schedules. On paper, this is a phenomenal idea, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, the ability to play as anyone is both Watch Dogs: Legion\u2019s greatest strength and greatest weakness.Watch Dogs: Legion takes place in a futuristic version of London. A private military contractor called Albion has been placed in charge of the city\u2019s security following a disastrous series of bombings orchestrated by a mysterious entity only known as Zero Day. DedSec, the group of hackers that you play as, has been framed for the attack, and it\u2019s up to you to discover Zero Day\u2019s true identity and rid the streets of Albion for good.Previous games in the series have tried to show that anyone can stand up to injustice, but you can only do so much with that message when you have a preset protagonist with exceptional skills and abilities. Legion takes things even further by literally letting anyone stand up to justice this time. That homeless guy on the street corner? DedSec operative. That old lady that can hardly run? DedSec operative. You really can recruit anyone, but a system that sprawling has to come with some caveats.In a game like XCOM, having an endless supply of unique characters works because the characters are nothing more than units. They shoot some aliens on their turn during combat and not much else. Legion takes things a step further and inserts these characters into cutscenes, gives them speaking roles, and places them at the forefront of the story. It doesn\u2019t work. The story suffers from a lack of a central set of protagonists. Character animations and voice acting also feel subpar across the board. Bagley, who is literally an artificial intelligence, feels more human than the members of DedSec. It feels like you\u2019re playing as NPCs.There were times where someone would speak on comms and I had no idea who they were. You can get a lot of people fairly easily, especially with the free no strings attached recruitments available after saving someone from Albion harassment, and it\u2019s hard to keep track of everyone when nobody has any real personality and you basically only use one or two people who have the best abilities. It feels like the people with the cool abilities are supposed to be the \u201cmain protagonists\u201d of your story that you spend most of your time controlling like Aiden or Marcus from the previous games and the rest of your recruits are supposed to be the side characters, but everyone is equally disposable and forgettable.The game attempts to remedy the whole \u201cno real protagonist\u201d problem with its supporting cast and villains, but each side character is forgettable. The central Zero-Day mystery drags on and on before eventually reaching an immensely unsatisfying conclusion. There are a few moments where the game hints at a potentially more interesting plot, but then the story moves on to the next uninteresting antagonist. It never provides enough time to flesh out its cast of characters. Legion\u2019s story is bad even by Watch Dogs standards.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c889e416-3314-47b3-a9ea-8af81b0f633f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c889e416-3314-47b3-a9ea-8af81b0f633f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "548d9b8a-7a48-49b6-a27f-9bd3c914964f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e24a579809520f9768f78ec192f95ca4f1d61de9b8ee771469f722d746d3bcd5"}, "3": {"node_id": "196ef79b-ed55-4f60-8bc8-ddeee620edfb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37cd1ee1e1ab5c9deab2b08671bf8e6bc1a0a12213d77913ffc379d33f80f93d"}}, "hash": "0a43bedec15c81471bddba81c9047e29f8a5d78b03cd2bd15dd9c7df51fbf009", "text": "Legion\u2019s story is bad even by Watch Dogs standards. Even Sabine, the main member of DedSec who orchestrates the group\u2019s reassembly following the Zero Day incident and serves as a major driving force in the plot, is wholly unremarkable. There were times when she\u2019d chime in on comms and I thought she was one of my random DedSec recruits I picked up off the street.While the story may not be anything special, the sheer flexibility of it all is mind-boggling. The DedSec operatives on my team, even my favorites, were not interesting characters that I grew attached to. Still, I never encountered a repeated face, outfit, or voice in roughly 30 hours of play. There\u2019s a vastness to the population of London that I\u2019ve never seen in a game before, and the thought that literally any one of them can become the center of this story and come face to face with Legion\u2019s cast of villains makes me want to replay the game again and again. You won\u2019t find a character on the level of Aiden Pearce or Marcus Holloway walking the streets of London, but there are thousands of mildly interesting everyday people waiting to join the resistance. The novelty of seeing your characters in cutscenes and thinking \u201cthat could be anybody\u201d never wears off. Many games have had multiple protagonists before, but Watch Dogs: Legion has endless protagonists.There is also a lot of simulation going on under the hood. Each NPC has a detailed daily schedule that you can look at and study, and you can use this information to recruit people who have a negative opinion of DedSec. Characters have their own relationships and remember past events. I scanned an Albion guard as a potential recruit only to find that one of my operatives had hospitalized him on a previous mission. I found my operative\u2019s therapist walking around and was able to recruit them easily because of that preexisting relationship. I saw operatives that I had retired going about their daily business. It really is a small world.Still, in a game where you\u2019re supposed to build a unique team that\u2019s personalized to you, I did not care about anyone. Even when I lost the star of my story, a professional hitman who could perform gun kata takedowns, I didn\u2019t feel anything more than slight frustration. Instead of feeling sad about the death of a character that I had been using for several hours, the most I could muster was a measly \u201coh well.\u201d You also start to see some a large amount of repetition in character occupations and abilities (there are a lot of gynecologists and construction workers in London). Character models and voices have a lot of variation, but when you see a dozen different people who have similar skill sets, the illusion of a diverse population is broken.DedSec recruits are nothing more than their weapons and abilities. I never felt compelled to learn anyone\u2019s name. It\u2019s hard to care about someone when their primary personality trait is \u201cAK-47.\u201d There\u2019s also never any real reason to have more than just a few team members. Unique weapons and abilities are usually just a gimmick. The most important abilities are gun ownership, car ownership, and hacking bonuses, but those are completed robbed of any utility when you can just hop into any car without penalty, use powerful non-lethal DedSec weapons, and hack any device with any character. I wish the game would have made most characters worse than they are, which would make sense because they\u2019re just random strangers, most of whom don\u2019t have any experience hacking or shooting. That way, finding a spy or police officer who is able to hack from further distances or bring along an MP5 would be much more exciting. There\u2019s no real reason to look out for a skilled hacker when that random homeless dude you picked up an hour ago can infiltrate a restricted area just as well.At least the gameplay is fun regardless of who you decide to play as. It\u2019s still typical Watch Dogs fare. You sneak into places where you\u2019re not supposed to be, press some buttons on your magic cell phone, and maybe shoot a guy or two. If you\u2019ve played a Watch Dogs game before, then you know what to expect. The play as anyone system throws a wrench into the mix by limiting your equipment and gear based on your playable character, but you\u2019ll always have access to the essentials. The only thing that matters that characters can miss out on is a gun, but everyone has access to non-lethal DedSec firearms anyway. Certain characters have special abilities like paint bombs or melee weapons, but these aren\u2019t too useful. You still have a lot of freedom when approaching an objective.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "196ef79b-ed55-4f60-8bc8-ddeee620edfb": {"__data__": {"id_": "196ef79b-ed55-4f60-8bc8-ddeee620edfb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "886212f4-1bec-496a-9c04-be386a9b3fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1cec49357973a1bbbc440a431df0460cddf42de5802b39f86567751663be877"}, "2": {"node_id": "c889e416-3314-47b3-a9ea-8af81b0f633f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a43bedec15c81471bddba81c9047e29f8a5d78b03cd2bd15dd9c7df51fbf009"}}, "hash": "37cd1ee1e1ab5c9deab2b08671bf8e6bc1a0a12213d77913ffc379d33f80f93d", "text": "You still have a lot of freedom when approaching an objective. You can sneak in yourself, hack a drone or spiderbot and get in that way, or just walk in the door with a gun and a mask.Unfortunately, Legion is plagued with samey missions and repetitive objectives. The majority of missions involve driving to a restricted area and hacking a thing, only to be told to drive to another building to hack yet another thing. If you\u2019re not doing that, you\u2019re hacking a thing and then staying within a certain distance of it while countless enemies flood the room. Watch Dogs 2 had better-designed levels, and it\u2019s a shame to see the series downgraded in this regard. Also, the shooting and driving still feel a little bit off. They\u2019re serviceable, but Legion makes you do way more shooting and driving than the previous two games, so it\u2019s more noticeable this time around. Melee combat has at least been improved somewhat, letting you dodge and guard break in addition to your standard punches, but the system is still fairly basic.At least the setting is great. London is an absolutely gorgeous city, especially at night. There\u2019s a lot of detail packed into every corner, and Watch Dogs has the added benefit of providing basic profiles to every NPC to make them feel more like people rather than set dressing. There\u2019s a wide range of unique storefronts, shops, and restaurants that help the city feel much more believable. A lot of consideration has been put into the game\u2019s futuristic setting as well. The majority of cars in London are electric and self-driving, and you can see drones flying overhead along the drone highway delivering packages and monitoring the streets. Each borough of the city also has a unique identity, largely due to the types of people you can find and recruit within them. It\u2019s not a massive open-world like Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, but it\u2019s still quite large. It\u2019s a very condensed and focused urban environment, and there\u2019s a lot to discover if you duck into alleyways or explore restricted areas.The play as anyone system is a wildly ambitious concept that I cannot wait to see in a sequel. Much like Shadow of Mordor\u2019s nemesis system, it\u2019s one of the most innovative mechanics to come out of this generation, even if it could still use some work. It definitely feels like a first iteration \u2013 the small pool of weapons and abilities make that very obvious \u2013 but everyone feels at least somewhat unique. It takes the profiling and scanning you could do for fun in Watch Dogs 1 and 2 and transforms it into an awesome gameplay mechanic. Still, the story suffers greatly because of this system, and the repetitive missions don\u2019t help either. Watch Dogs: Legion feels like a great proof of concept, and I hope this isn\u2019t the last time we see the play as anyone system. All in all, Watch Dogs: Legion is an okay game propped up by an ambitious idea.\n- This article was updated on October 28th, 2020 \nCurrently serving as an Associate Editor at Attack of the Fanboy, Diego Perez has been writing about video games since 2018, specializing in live service games like Destiny and Final Fantasy XIV.
