For the majority of the time, developer-publisher CD Projekt told us we could expect it when it's ready, and not a moment sooner. Unfortunately, it isn't. Cyberpunk 2077 has finally arrived, thunderous and yellow, after months of reported 'death march' crunch - enforced overtime extended repeatedly to shifting deadlines - and sadly it shows. Even putting the human cost aside, it is an enormous shame. As much as the excitement has been at times irresponsibly over-fanned, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game of vast ambition. It's driven by a core of characters wonderfully written and performed, a story of genuine layer, momentum and depth, a technical feat of immersive decision-making, and pumping, sim-inspired action. But the undeniable potential is drowning under the tidal wave of little issues. An uncharacteristic carelessness to the finer points, some pervasive immaturity of thought, and distracting, recurring bugs leave Cyberpunk 2077 as a game in conflict: a world of unmatched detail, in dire need of attention. But how I love it, nonetheless. Cyberpunk 2077 follows CD Projekt's trend for adapting its games from the grittier kinds of genre fiction. As The Witcher games drew heavily from Andrzej Sapkowski's Polish fantasy novels, Cyberpunk 2077 does from Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk, a 1988 tabletop RPG. The result is a strong emphasis on immersion at all costs, a slightly of-its-time tone, and far greater choice in what you can do and how you can do it than in any of the studio's previous games.You play as V, starting with a choice between three 'life paths' that dictate your background and what happens to you in the first four or five hours of the game, as well as providing you with occasional life path-specific dialogue prompts throughout. It's a neat idea, but the real consequence of it is hard to tell - for me, playing V as a woman with a 'Corpo' life path, it served as a fun jump-off for some very light, conversational role-playing as a once-vicious power broker now fallen from grace (think Luv, of Blade Runner 2049, if Wallace gave her the boot), but that was about it. The role-playing is focused, sticking to depth of choice through your personality, your decisions, and your plan of attack, but notably not the breadth of things to do - no guilds or playstyle-specific pseudo main-quest stories like those of The Elder Scrolls, or an MMO.You also begin with a deep, if somewhat overcompensating character creator. The customisation is equal parts fantastic and ridiculous, and a good look at CD Projekt's conflicted approach in microcosm. There are wonderful, microscopic details to hair and fingernails and scarring - and also half a dozen penis options, choices for breast size and the diameter of your areola. There are just the two genders, mind, and, in the game's words, the pronouns people will use for you in-game are dictated by your voice - an oddly prudish and self-defeating decision, that's clumsy at best and sits at odds with the world itself, making for one where everyone can modify their limbs and eyeballs and sub-dermalogica membrane at will, but god forbid anything else.The world CD Projekt has sought to create with Cyberpunk 2077 is everything, of course. Few games in my memory have sparked such intense and interesting discussion of genre, and in cyberpunk dystopia is inseparable from the genre itself. And what a beast Cyberpunk 2077's dystopia is. Night City is a monster. A putrid, monolithic, contemptible, shrieking hellhole and monument to maximalism, the temptation is to view it in isolation as just that: a horrible world created as a kind of hyped-up, GTA-style pastiche (and there is a lot of GTA here), lampooning somewhat accurately but also peevishly, the kind where everyone's the target and easy nihilism is the goal, sporadic and facile. It doesn't exist in isolation though, far from it. Night City is Cyberpunk 2077's nemesis, your character's foil. It goes beyond the easy parodies, the insufferable talking heads, the insipid advertising boards. The sounds are masterfully aligned: humming neon, buzzing flies, whirring motors, screeching horns, yelling passers-by.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7043702b-3341-4b15-99f2-8f62df7bd814": {"__data__": {"id_": "7043702b-3341-4b15-99f2-8f62df7bd814", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "513d3e26-abad-4ec1-9bae-29c06469f8bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d86659ccb00e0554192a160211e03b49456b1eac67123a608ff9c4397fe61c2b"}, "3": {"node_id": "c100f49c-9d12-44ab-b081-f42a07629ff5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b1289cd2543baedb4463164d69917189619c03c325638735bf01cc75e738b17"}}, "hash": "272dda07bcaef0be0f056f21df2bc8574af23a0246706d8d5b53301c0836def6", "text": "In missions it's the same, the world tinged in perennial high-alert red, with a piercingly shrill noise that sounds every time you're even half spotted, or clip the wrong pedestrian on another chaotic ride. Cyberpunk 2077 might have GTA's five star 'wanted' system, but it doesn't work the same - you're obliterated in an instant when you get to four - and it might have denser crowds, in some places, but they're even more hateful here. The point of it is its hostility. Night City's an unlivable, unbearable place where you feel relentlessly watched and on-edge, where V, performed with superlative nuance by Cherami Leigh, can barely keep it together. I'm reminded of a deeply sensitive moment that will stay with me for some time, where the story leads V to a brothel in search of a lead and, given the uneven tone, you brace for the sordid. Instead, what followed was a moment of intense intimacy, a conversation that picked V apart, dismantling her paper-thin guard, even as she knows it's this person's job to do that, that there's no sincerity to the words at all. You end up lying, foetal and afraid, on the bed in this womb-pink booth, looking through the eyes of a character now deconstructed and absurd. \"Don't make me go back out there,\" she says, and I don't want to either.In fact, everyone in Cyberpunk 2077 is barely keeping it together. The plot is some straight-up Paul Verhoeven - late '80s edge, future dystopia, gore - and through the cloud of guts and technobabble it sizzles and cracks with raucous momentum. It's paced impeccably, balancing the techno-action-crime-thriller narrative with an uncanny ability to slow things down. There's a narrative game buried in Cyberpunk 2077's noise in fact, as it becomes clearer with each lengthy, intimate conversation between the carnage. Where other games of its kind would give you a minute or less for the perfunctory heart-to-heart, Cyberpunk gives you hours, talking over childhood and life as you stake out some joint for a heist. Talking belonging and personhood and the homeliness of love in the desert. Talking identity with yourself, Keanu Reeves cast ingeniously against type as an atomic arsehole stuffed into the back of your head, loveable and vile.So much energy has been directed at the question of Cyberpunk 2077's parable. Of what it says. It says nothing. What matters is not what it tells you but what it offers up for you to find, what it is about. What it is about is total, human fear; of alienation in every form; the all-consumptive terror of human life in the inhuman world. V is cast adrift, gasping, floundering, her intense vulnerability and that of the tragic, beautifully crafted characters she meets set against the most invulnerable enemy. It asks the more typical sci-fi questions of humanity and identity and purpose, too, to mixed success, but crucially without hard answers. In other words: it does its job. Like all great stories, Cyberpunk 2077's requires you to put something of yourself into it to mine the depths, not simply look at the surface and read the message off.Cyberpunk 2077 is not just a narrative game, of course. Maybe it's worse off for that, but there are other places where it shines almost as bright. Combat itself is simple, almost alarmingly so. Blades are more or less quick attack, block, or heavy attack, for instance, like Skyrim with a hand behind your back - and it's utterly chaotic. But it's fun, fluid, ridiculous, after you desensitize yourself to the puerility of the gore. After a long while, the guns do warm up to the more excessive kind that Cyberpunk 2077's tone requires, and the stealth and hacking aren't full immersive sim stuff - the depth of physics just isn't there - but they are varied, and the sandbox full of toys. Where it's elevated is the systems that work behind the scenes. You can play it stealthily ( and entirely non-lethally, I think); you can play it as just a 'netrunner', hacking enemies into spontaneous combustion and taking over the contraptions around them; you can go in violently, which is the easiest and most varied. Blades, blunts, fists, pistols, assault weapons, shotguns and heavy LMGs all have their own sub-skill trees, as do the different sides of hacking and skulking and crafting, too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c100f49c-9d12-44ab-b081-f42a07629ff5": {"__data__": {"id_": "c100f49c-9d12-44ab-b081-f42a07629ff5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "7043702b-3341-4b15-99f2-8f62df7bd814", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "272dda07bcaef0be0f056f21df2bc8574af23a0246706d8d5b53301c0836def6"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4153700-0765-4627-92f0-971fe867497b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aa587bb3b1dc8605e9bc86066857d17c74412663c7aa60fb0342b2ed7de8fccc"}}, "hash": "3b1289cd2543baedb4463164d69917189619c03c325638735bf01cc75e738b17", "text": "There's good depth to how these all tie together: you can modify your body with cybernetics, which can set you up for enjoyable feedback loops on your cooldowns and capacities. You can craft new weapons and outfits and new mods for enhancing those. You can grind for specific perks - your progress half-tied to how often you use a certain playstyle, half to overall level - which again feed back into the loop of all the other things at work. You can plan and strategize these builds forever, and replay again with something that feels very different.This is also where Cyberpunk 2077 really stumbles, and keeps on stumbling from there. I finished the entire story, plus a handful of sidequests, with just one cybernetic installed out of scores of options, after crafting just one or two guns to see how it worked, after barely half-upgrading one of the near-dozen skill trees. It's possible to glide through Cyberpunk 2077 easily, without ever scratching the surface of its systems, and while that sounds like a selling point I don't think it is. It's poorly signposted, poorly breadcrumbed, poorly paced, above all. You get the most XP for completing main story quests, but I was genuinely too low-level to unlock anything good by the time I was done. Even going back after the end to drink in more of the world and dive into the side activities, the sense is still that most of the game's interesting mechanics are blocked off, behind massive piles of money, experience, and time. If you have to blast through almost everything the game has to offer before you can actually play it at its potential, something's gone wrong.The impression here is a lack of care - maybe a lack of time to give it care - and it persists. Driving for instance is pretty poor, with motorbikes' turning circles like trucks and again just the little things missing. Notice in GTA how, at high speeds, the minimap zooms out, giving you a view of where you'll need to turn up ahead. In Cyberpunk 2077 you're past the turning before you know it's there.The UI, in particular the world map, is dreadful. Across the blood-red smear are hundreds upon hundreds of exclamation marks. Some of them are for missions you've received, some of them aren't - there's no way to tell without hovering over each one, and so there's no at-a-glance readability to the world. You can't plan your exploration in any meaningful way, and so you end up relying on just completing the missions you already have. And those will, inevitably, come via your phone. How I longed to tear that cursed device from the back of V's head and toss it into the sea. Your smartphone is your hub. People will call and text you, ceaselessly, with cars for you to buy, welcome messages to new regions, conversational texts (often touching and funny but swallowed amid all the rest), new jobs, updates on inactive jobs you're not tracking, interruptions, buggily, to conversations you're already having, an AI chauffeur yelling about its latest runaway wagon while another buddy dies in your arms. This is Cyberpunk 2077's final scourge. Bugs persist, slightly reduced after a patch but nowhere close to squashed. It feels cruel to linger on them too much, but they're topped by a persistent animation bug that's plagued my entire playthrough, and those of others I know to have played it too. Characters get caught in idle animations, while scenes of death and melodrama are repeatedly undermined by someone skidding about and pirouetting like a giant chess piece on ice, which is a devastating shame. There are more, and fixes are ongoing, but the point remains that Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that can feel very close to falling apart. It's immersion-breaking, in a game where immersion is absolutely paramount.Honestly, it's a dilemma. Technical issues are often passing, but what lingers is the lack of readiness, in the wider sense. The lack of requisite care. The story is a marvel, as is the sheer, red mist hostility of the world that houses it. The promised depth of systems are there, but mishandled. The maturity - and recall CD Projekt describing Cyberpunk, on announcement, as \"a mature RPG for a mature audience\" - is often not. Maturity in the immature sense, maybe: the teenage idea of it, that 'maturity' equals Rated M and can be found in nakedness, coarseness, blood and guts, when in actuality it's closer to something like the forced perspective gained from time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4153700-0765-4627-92f0-971fe867497b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4153700-0765-4627-92f0-971fe867497b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "c100f49c-9d12-44ab-b081-f42a07629ff5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3b1289cd2543baedb4463164d69917189619c03c325638735bf01cc75e738b17"}, "3": {"node_id": "f53b7c2c-8ac9-495e-b1dd-3840b75bb3db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8973952583b0a2eecccb71bed95db20066440a5030d195395e787c10c5e4dbe4"}}, "hash": "aa587bb3b1dc8605e9bc86066857d17c74412663c7aa60fb0342b2ed7de8fccc", "text": "My lingering impression of Cyberpunk 2077 is of a game that's shouting over itself, relentlessly at odds with its own creative voice.

Somehow I've ended up in the Japantown neighborhood's Arasaka-financed streets, where animated billboards for \"Sweet Clean Speed\" and pornographic braindances climb the flanks of utilitarian skyscrapers, blotting out the stars with a rainbow of neon. I pass a ramen shop, a hot dog stand, and a man selling spice, piles of garbage tucked beneath the offramp behind him.\u00a0A mob of Christians gather at a nearby intersection, waving signs and screaming \"Blasphemers!\" at the cops. A voice makes booming proclamations in Japanese from loudspeakers overhead, flying cars crisscrossing the invisible roads between buildings. The sky glows with light pollution, but the moon is full and clear. It's a beautiful night.\u00a0I just left Judy Alvarez's place. My friend's been through a lot lately. Someone close to her has been victim to a string of horrors including sexual assault, physical trauma, and suicidal tendencies. We had a big heart-to-heart about it, undermined by the presence of elaborate arm-knife crosshairs fixed on her forehead even though I put my arm-knives away earlier (I'm polite like that). There was also the notification from that fancy sniper rifle I picked up 20 minutes ago, still notifying me that I picked up a sniper rifle. Duly noted, notification.But hey, Judy's not perfect either. I've seen her clip through chairs and float across the room while confessing something deeply personal. And yet, I am duty bound to stick through the bugs for my friend. I genuinely care about her.\u00a0She's on my mind while I continue my walk through Night City. Ahead, a streetlamp floats in the air, its base failing to load. A busker plays an invisible guitar. The facade of a skyscraper flickers briefly. Something ain't right, so I call my car and it arrives in classic Roach style, driving through a concrete barrier, screeching to a halt. As I approach, a van spawns in the same space and the two vehicles fight to exist before my taxi spurts out and knocks me to the ground. Should I call Judy, see if she's hanging in there?It's just another day in Cyberpunk 2077, a pretty good RPG in an amazing setting absolutely sick with bugs.\u00a0There won't be another open world like this for a long, long time.\u00a0I love wandering the mountains of trash on the outskirts of town, cutting pretty silhouettes from a distance. Up close, well, it's trash. And sometimes the smog gets so thick around the old Arasaka memorial downtown you can't see the tops of buildings, everything washed in dirty orange light. I watched traffic here for a while, employees of the corporate world hurrying to and fro all around me.\u00a0What is it? An open world action RPG set in the near future.\nExpect to pay: $60/\u00a350\nDeveloper: CD Projekt Red\nPublisher: CD Projekt Red\nReviewed on: i9-9900k, RTX 2080, 16GB RAM, installed on SSD\nMultiplayer?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37a40a1a-9582-40a7-8d09-ef785bbd4718": {"__data__": {"id_": "37a40a1a-9582-40a7-8d09-ef785bbd4718", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "f53b7c2c-8ac9-495e-b1dd-3840b75bb3db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8973952583b0a2eecccb71bed95db20066440a5030d195395e787c10c5e4dbe4"}, "3": {"node_id": "0359d6f5-e5b5-4c51-8212-ce9f13d98ba2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b21ec89cff0df1c3e5a5cfb51d73d16bf6a79675e597a1cad3946bdb5570be7c"}}, "hash": "0e5af161c3fc740ec9607e38ff060ed13c2404fb6416c83ae7bbdb04bb495374", "text": "No, planned in far flung future\nLink: www.cyberpunk.net\u00a0\nRelease date: Here's when Cyberpunk 2077 unlocks by timezoneThen there's the Biotechnica farm: A city of tents stretching into the horizon, swarms of transport vehicles buzzing to and fro tending to their synthetic protein flowers. From here, Night City looks as small as a city in a snow globe. And you can just walk there. The scale and density is mind boggling, every area clearly touched by countless artists and neatly embedded into the history and logistics of Night City.\u00a0Take a microscope to it and you'll see the seams instantly. NPCs are aimless automatons or carefully posed puppets. I've seen the same guy, at least his shape, splayed out on a couch playing guitar all over the city. I made the mistake of stopping to inspect a roadside rave in the Badlands, only to realize there were three sets of triplets in attendance. Sometimes far off textures load in a touch too late, or the five o'clock rush hour snaps into existence in front of your eyes. Night City is a stage, not a simulation.\u00a0But if you stay moving and keep your eyes trained ahead, every frame is a striking, lively scene. Night City is nearly unparalleled at middle to long distances, joining the best of PC gaming's open worlds, which include Red Dead Redemption 2's American west and Grand Theft Auto 5's Los Santos. Rockstar's been matched. I'd pay full price just to walk around and take photos forever, my senses perpetually drunk.\u00a0It's an incredible work that the stories within never quite measure up to.\u00a0The variety of citizens in Night City is remarkable, with outrageous future fashions, wild hairstyles, and elaborate cyber implants. You'll see rodeo cowboys with mechanical legs, tattooed yakuza, faces crisscrossed with cyberware, '80s metalheads sporting wraparound neon visors, and people so heavily augmented you'll wonder if there's any human left. There's a real sense of this being a teeming, vibrant metropolis with layers of history and culture. And everyone just looks cool as hell.Cyberpunk's main quest storyline is full of interesting ideas, but marred by inconsistent characterization and focus. Johnny Sliverhand, played by a grumpy Keanu Reeves, and you, a merc for hire and fully-voiced character named V, are centerstage. As V, you're an accidental witness to a top level corporate assassination and forced to work with Johnny, not only to expose the truth, but to save V's life. Early on, due to a series of unfortunate events, a backup of Johnny Silverhand's consciousness ends up in V's head and begins to slowly take over his mind, effectively overwriting V.\u00a0The effect Johnny has on V, and the equal and potentially opposite or compounding effect V has on Johnny is the heart of the RPG decision-making here. Johnny is a repulsive, crude, misogynist. And you can change that, assuming he doesn't swing you his way first, nevermind all the fixers, friends, and corporations pulling you every other direction.\u00a0I had no clue whether to take my special pills to suppress the maniac in my head or to try and change him, the ambiguous and agonizing choice I want in an RPG. The blinders are on the whole time and nearly every decision is a leap of faith that hangs on your ideals, or at least the ideas of the character you're roleplaying.\u00a0I just wish Johnny's characterization were more consistent. While I'd make major progressions in our relationship in the main quest, he'd regularly revert to the same old dickhead Johnny in a sidequest or the odd commentary impressively scattered throughout the entirety of Night City.\u00a0I became friends with a sentient, autonomous taxicab operation\u2014like, a whole-ass business. Too often what he has to say in these optional interactions is one note: Rockerboy trash talk, ego and narcissistic idealism personified, like an anarchy tag on an interstate Starbucks come to life. Keanu's mad, monotone performance doesn't help highlight the nuance either. While I loved where our relationship eventually ended up, I felt like Cyberpunk 2077 didn't really show me the work it took to get there.\u00a0As a basic, adaptable foil for V, Johnny is a nice engine for introspection. Capitalism is bad, for sure, but Cyberpunk isn't interested in solving that problem. Cyberpunk instead asks why we choose to live within such a monstrous system, and I deeply appreciate the spotlight on V, the people in his life, and how they persist (or don't) in the muck.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0359d6f5-e5b5-4c51-8212-ce9f13d98ba2": {"__data__": {"id_": "0359d6f5-e5b5-4c51-8212-ce9f13d98ba2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "37a40a1a-9582-40a7-8d09-ef785bbd4718", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e5af161c3fc740ec9607e38ff060ed13c2404fb6416c83ae7bbdb04bb495374"}, "3": {"node_id": "f243a7ab-cd17-466b-bf5a-601aa60fd8d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3676bbc9b415669fe13ad9b509b8d8e28ae02490ed74a2aa69241451341e490"}}, "hash": "b21ec89cff0df1c3e5a5cfb51d73d16bf6a79675e597a1cad3946bdb5570be7c", "text": "Yeah, the story is wrapped up in espionage, sabotage, and conspiracy at the highest order with a heaping side of corporate satire.

I fell in love with a nomad and took on the personal mission to become a reformed Corpo dorko, dreams of getting out of the city and living a simpler life. Permaculture is easy when your arms are knives. And, to my surprise, Cyberpunk supported an eerily appropriate arc for me, not one-to-one, but a testament to the sprawling narrative choices laid out under the skin.\u00a0I know there are at least three endings (I chose mine after 10 minutes of staring at the screen, frozen), and that there are definitely more depending on who you befriend and/or romance. These aren't poorly compressed slideshow epilogues either, but hour-long endeavors, the kind of resplendent, explosive, dramatic stuff most big studios struggle to make one of.\u00a0And I wouldn't have seen any of it if I'd skipped out on the side missions, a few of which are still left unfinished at the end of my 50-hour playthrough. While entirely optional, seeing through every side character's story to the end can fundamentally change how the larger story wraps. I spent a long time with Panam, a perky, stubborn nomad vying for respect among her peers. She deserved a chance. I also spent days deeply investigating Johnny's tragic past. I befriended a beat cop trying to stick to his morals in a clearly fixed game, hunting down a serial killer using surreal, invasive means in what might be my favorite quest of them all. Through a delightful series of misadventures I became friends with a sentient, autonomous taxicab operation\u2014like, a whole-ass business.\u00a0The deeper sidequests are infrequent, too difficult to separate from the endless warehouse infiltration Gigs, but they're all good to great, and some are up there with CD Projekt's best, even if there's no clear Bloody Baron standout.\u00a0Too bad almost every serious dramatic beat was undercut by some kind of bug, ranging from a UI crowded by notifications and crosshairs failing to disappear, to full-on scripting errors halting otherwise rad action scenes. What should've been my favorite main quest venture, a thrilling infiltration mission set in a crowded public event, was ruined by two broken elevators. I had to reload a few times to get them working.The most absurd bug might've been when some children spawned in front of a timed shooting contest I entered with a friendly nomad. I couldn't shoot anywhere near the children because my weapon automatically raised, so I just sat there and let the timer run out as my buddy talked shit.More often the bugs are audiovisual tics, like the sound of a car loudly peeling out wailing on during a long drive as passenger with an NPC, a character passing through solid elevator doors, or a copy of Johnny's cigarette hanging in the air in front of me while he smokes another and goes on about what a coward I am. They're the kind of thing I can squint through here and there, but there wasn't a single quest in which something wacky didn't happen.\u00a0Even the final scene in the closing moments of my ending featured cars spawning in the direct path of an NPC-driven vehicle. A nice, poignant drive and conversation seasoned with a head-on collision visible only to me. Even after installing the Day 0 patch, Night City still feels like it's barely holding together at times. The good news is that all this stuff can be fixed, but it also means the ideal Cyberpunk 2077 is delayed again, in spirit.\u00a0Fallout: New Vegas was a mess at launch too, and smoothed out over time.

Bugs are a guarantee in games this big, but after 8 years in development and multiple delays, I hoped Cyberpunk 2077 would go down much smoother than this.\u00a0With so many clothes to choose from, fashion (and buying cars) basically becomes the Cyberpunk endgame. Just be prepared to give up some armor and stat bonuses to wear what you like.\u00a0The action holds together well enough, an FPS charcuterie board featuring some familiar Deus Ex stealth and hacking systems alongside the snappy ADS gunplay Call of Duty made standard. Weapons and armor have unique stats, though it's all pretty easily reduced to how much damage you can do and withstand versus the level of the enemies you're facing\u2014the rest, including fashion, is left to preference. It's exciting stuff in the early hours, all those stats and weapons laid out before you, but the bottom drops out pretty quickly.\u00a0Night City is stuffed with warehouses, armories, and secret labs to sneak into, most often via jobs a neighborhood fixer sets you up with. Infiltrate and kill a guy, rescue a prisoner, steal some data\u2014the objectives bleed together quickly because the means tend to repeat too, at least if you're locked into a playstyle. I wanted to be a cyber ninja at first, using quickhacks to turn off cameras, destroy turrets, and blind my enemies before moving in with my katana and hacking them to bits.\u00a0Things went well for a while, but pouring all my experience and perk points into blades made me nearly unkillable and my enemies as soft as Vienna sausage within a few hours. I like that my armor increases when I sprint, and that perfectly timed dodges initiate a short bout of slow-motion. I just don't think that beheading 10 men a minute should ever feel so simple and carefree.\u00a0Even if I take it slow, and I did for around 10 hours, enemy AI is disappointingly rote. Stealth is a game of vision cones and patrol routes, with nearly no meaningful distinctions between gangs and corporations. I got so bored of sneaking around that I specced into more aggressive quickhacks, including one that set off a poisonous chain reaction between nearby goons, and rolled some pistols into my regimine. Now I slide into the room in slow motion, activating my favorite pistol ability, and headshot a few grunts before I even come to a stop. I clean up those that haven't choked on gas with my arm knives, snipping limbs off like paper dolls. It's rad as hell, but I'm just showing off for the sake of it, not because Cyberpunk is encouraging me to use every tool in the box.Combat and infiltration sadly depend too much on player showmanship, never pressing you to make tactical decisions in the thick of it, and worse, never prodding you to make meaningful decisions about where to pour your points. There's a ton of variety with potential for creative hybrid builds, from a barefisted gorilla hacker V to a loud gun-toting pacifist that walks and talks like Rambo but installs non-lethal mods on every weapon.\u00a0I\u2019m taken by how relentlessly hopeful Cyberpunk is.The gunplay feels great too: each gun treated with extravagant viewmodels, and adorned slick firing, idle, and reload animations. Heads pop and limbs dissolve, shotguns knock enemies on their cyberbutts\u2014CD Projekt knows what bullets do, and it shows. For the quieter players looking for some Deus Ex, there's always a cleverly hidden sewer grate or balcony door to discover. But without any meaningful variations on enemy or level design after the first few hours, Cyberpunk is missing the incentive to experiment with it all.\u00a0Luckily, most of my time in Cyberpunk has been at a languid pace, spent chatting with friends and criminals, outlaws and AIs, or going on impromptu walking tours around a neighborhood I somehow missed 40 hours in. It's so, so nice to look at, and besides the bugs, Cyberpunk 2077 runs pretty well, though I worry about how much I'm leaning on Nvidia's DLSS feature to keep my framerates high.\u00a0With an RTX 2080, i9-9900K, and installed on a SATA SSD, with DLSS enabled on Quality mode on the High graphics preset (no ray-tracing), I maintain a variable 60-80 fps at 2560x1440, dipping lowest when driving through particularly reflection-heavy parts of town. With DLSS off, the frame window drops to 40-50 fps. Ray-tracing options are particularly resource intensive, so I just kept them off. The framerate hit wasn't worth the fancy lighting, nice as it looks on a rainy day or in a neon-lit club especially.

Either way, a newer card will go a long way in Cyberpunk 2077, though players still hanging in at 1080p should do fine with older hardware.\u00a0It's the kind of game I'd upgrade for though, because Cyberpunk is a technical stunner and seeing your friends in high definition is worth the ask. Sure, The Witcher 3 was funnier, more clever and subversive, with better dialogue on the whole, but I\u2019m taken by how relentlessly hopeful Cyberpunk is. Its exploration of a technocapitalist future relies heavily on genre tropes, with everyone from punks to dirty cops playing the part established way back in William Gibson's Neuromancer. But Cyberpunk 2077 remains a loving, faithful treatment of the genre, and one that constantly urged me to look for the silver lining in every shit-soaked gutter.Even if you can nosedive V into a life of crime and greed, the repercussions highlight what's possible in the relief of what you reject in favor of power and money. Cyberpunk 2077 is a game about close relationships, or if you're roleplaying a more coldhearted type, seeing what life is like at the top without them.\u00a0I found it moving and life-affirming in the final moments, even in the face of near certain death and a relentless onslaught of bugs. I suppose it's an appropriate thematic throughline though: Cyberpunk 2077 is a game about V coming apart at the seams, in a city coming apart at the seams, in a game coming apart at the seams. Play it in a few months.Some nice characters and stories nested in an astounding open world, undercut by jarring bugs at every turn. James is stuck in an endless loop, playing the Dark Souls games on repeat until Elden Ring and Silksong set him free.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, The most anticipated video game of 2020 is finally out, as the makers of The Witcher 3 create a beautifully ugly sci-fi world.Not since No Man\u2019s Sky has so little been known about so big a game before its release, which is particularly strange given how many people have convinced themselves that Cyberpunk 2077 is going to be one of the games of the generation. It is not, in our opinion, quite that good but despite its issues \u2013 some technical, some conceptual \u2013 it\u2019s the perfect game to end the outgoing generation on, as it offers a fascinating recap of the last seven years and an inspiring hint at what we might be able to expect in the future.The strange thing about Cyberpunk is that despite there having been virtually no hands-on previews, with console review copies only being sent out three days before launch, it\u2019s been in development for eight years. Most of the technical problems are simply because the day one patch wasn\u2019t ready in time for reviews, as the game only made its pre-Christmas release date by the skin of its teeth. Coronavirus is obviously to blame for most of that but it\u2019s a shame, as complaining about bugs just gets in the way of what\u2019s actually interesting, and disappointing, about Cyberpunk.Just in case you missed the memo, Cyberpunk is the latest game from CD Projekt Red, creators of The Witcher 3. There are nominal similarities between the two games, in that they\u2019re both open world action role-players, but you\u2019d never guess any connection if you didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t the same developer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07a5fb9a-26fc-4385-a886-57a614749ea1": {"__data__": {"id_": "07a5fb9a-26fc-4385-a886-57a614749ea1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "7348f4ef-c1c4-4ffe-9c6d-ae4f015acc4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "48330433b69a0812901443ef0277a8ad83d98a0d03cb048c765d844726ff7fb7"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7cc8472-e393-425f-a1da-ff21e0803526", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0735368bcab4c7dc660aefce00028406416cb93db1f592bf3e73790178b24a48"}}, "hash": "02986446919b5d840cd531f81c5f50ebb1e7765b9ebc0d6d915eee8e4da68b05", "text": "For a start, the setting is much more than a cosmetic difference, with Cyberpunk\u2019s world being far more cynical and exploitative, where life is cheap and there are no heroes at all.One difference between the two games that has been somewhat overstated is that in Cyberpunk you don\u2019t play as a predetermined character, which isn\u2019t really true. You play as \u2018V\u2019 and while you can customise how they look to a degree, and whether they\u2019re male or female, they do have a pre-defined personality and backstory \u2013 just not ones as detailed as Geralt.At first it doesn\u2019t seem like this is going to be a problem, until you begin to notice an increasingly wide disconnect between side missions \u2013 where you\u2019re generally free to do and act as you please \u2013 and story missions which are much more controlled and where you frequently find yourself not wanting to pick any of the proffered dialogue options because it\u2019s obvious the illusion of choice is pushing you down a pre-set path.With most games you\u2019re either playing a pre-existing character or your own custom avatar but Cyberpunk takes an awkward position between the two, that doesn\u2019t seem to offer any benefit. Things start off well though, with each of the character types getting a different intro, with the option to play V as someone from the societal elite, someone from the opposite end of town, and a sort of Mad Max loner that\u2019s never been to the big city before.These first moments are hugely impressive, as the full glory of Cyberpunk\u2019s graphics are revealed. Although we\u2019ve not had time to complete the game on PS4 Pro we\u2019ve played enough to see that the visuals are almost equally impressive there, with superb facial animation and a gigantic open world city that really does feel like you\u2019re exploring a more violent version of Blade Runner\u2019s L.A.It\u2019s the level of detail that impresses the most, from the jewellery and cybernetic implants of everyone you meet to the building interiors that are filled with bric-a-brac you can pick up or interact with. The map itself isn\u2019t that big but the density and interactivity of every location is far preferable to another barren, open world map of the sort you\u2019ve seen dozens of times before.The story is divided into acts, with the first taking a while to get into gear but ending in impressively shocking style. By this point you realise that Cyberpunk is much more of an action game than previously imagined, so it\u2019s a good job that the first person action is very good and lightyears beyond fellow first person role-players like Fallout.The gunplay isn\u2019t exactly Destiny \u2013 it\u2019s just a little too flat at times \u2013 but it is precise and satisfying, with the huge range of different guns all having a different purpose and tactility. The melee combat is also good fun, especially given how difficult the first person perspective makes it to judge distance. Fisticuffs feel weighty and thoughtful, while the streamlined control system ensures you can wield baseball bats, samurai swords, or just your own two fists with equal elan.All of this would be good in any game but the cyberpunk aesthetic underlies everything, since in almost every situation you can choose between several hacking options, whether you\u2019re blinding an opponent\u2019s cybernetic eyes, setting off the grenades hanging by their belt, or using background objects, from gun turrets to explosive barrels, to aid in combat.This works equally well when you\u2019re trying to be stealthy, when the game borrows ideas from the earlier Watch Dogs titles in terms of hacking cameras so you can then hack other cameras so you can get a bead on a computer or enemy you otherwise couldn\u2019t see. However, stealth is the only action element that feels unfair without special augments, especially the one that can slow down time, to put the odds more in your favour.Mechanically there\u2019s almost nothing to complain about and while this wouldn\u2019t fly if it was just a straight action game \u2013 the gunplay is good but not that good \u2013 the wide range of options for every encounter, including just talking to people, gives an empowering sense of freedom and control.Cyberpunk is a role-playing game though, with a fairly standard set of stats and skill trees for you to work you through and a crafting system that allows you to improve your weapons and equipment with collected resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7cc8472-e393-425f-a1da-ff21e0803526": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7cc8472-e393-425f-a1da-ff21e0803526", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "07a5fb9a-26fc-4385-a886-57a614749ea1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "02986446919b5d840cd531f81c5f50ebb1e7765b9ebc0d6d915eee8e4da68b05"}, "3": {"node_id": "67c73fb4-1128-4aca-9ae6-91302a15053a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb3c1848af64b7ad438175c25303b0f43ab5c99212fb30eca6eeef4090671e1a"}}, "hash": "0735368bcab4c7dc660aefce00028406416cb93db1f592bf3e73790178b24a48", "text": "At times this can feel a bit too much like Fallout style rubbish collection, as you pick up everything that\u2019s not tied down, but most will appreciate the added depth it gives you and if you can\u2019t be bothered you can always buy or steal weapons that are almost as good.Where the game falters is in how it tries to pull together the action, the storytelling, and the role-playing elements. As in The Witcher 3, the side quests are frequently the most enjoyable parts, with a wider range of, occasionally less serious, objectives and more time to get to know the various side characters.However, this non-linear approach is at odds not only with the more restrictive choices present in the story missions but also the fact that the main plot is implied to be a matter of great urgency \u2013 even though you spend most of your time wandering around town trying to earn enough money to have a pair of retractable swords grafted into your arms. That\u2019s a problem with all open world games to a degree but the way the main story is presented seems to almost purposefully make things worse.Either way, the writing is generally very good, as you\u2019d expect from the makers of The Witcher 3, and most of the characters, including V, are much more sympathetic and relatable than the game\u2019s obnoxious marketing would have you imagine.Strangely, one of the key exceptions is Keanu Reeves\u2019 cyber-ghost character, who on paper is pretty objectionable and only made bearable by Revees\u2019 performance. Despite that, he\u2019s a welcome addition to the game, as his constant jibes and unwanted advice provide a different perspective to each encounter and ensures V always has someone to talk to.There is a problem with Night City itself though, which is portrayed as a dystopian nightmare, controlled by corporations who encourage vapid consumerism and a dog-eat-dog mentality. Everything can be bought for a price and yet human life has been rendered almost worthless. It\u2019s heavy stuff, in theory, but most of the time it just comes across like Grand Theft Auto without the satire.Rather than thoughtful sci-fi, the tone of the game is often puerile and distasteful, as if CD Projekt let a bunch of 15-year-olds design all the hyper-sexualised advertising and body horror grossness and left the grown-ups to write the dialogue.There\u2019s been a lot of controversy over CD Projekt\u2019s portrayal of transgender characters and it\u2019s hard not to agree with those who complain about the fetishised posters that are dotted all over the city, given there are no obviously transgender main characters. Especially as you\u2019re given a choice of genitalia in the character creator but you don\u2019t get to pick the gender, which is tied to the seemingly arbitrary choice of whether your voice sounds masculine or feminine.CD Projekt brought up the subject \u2013 it\u2019s not as if these are standard options in every character creator \u2013 and yet their unwillingness to engage with transgender issues in terms of storytelling seems undeniably exploitive. And if you were already arching your eyebrows at how the Voodoo Boys were portrayed during one of the pre-release gameplay videos you should be warned that things have not changed in the final game, with other non-white characters also portrayed in a worryingly stereotypical manner.The final issue is that while V\u2019s personal story is compelling, as you explore traditional cyberpunk themes of transhumanism and identity, the criticism of corporations and capitalism comes across as curiously toothless. Perhaps CD Projekt is embarrassed by the accusations of them exploiting their own workforce with forced overtime but it\u2019s disappointing that the game can be so in-your-face on some subjects and yet so timid on others.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationWhatever else you say about it, Cyberpunk is a stunning technical achievement, even if it will take a while to iron out every bug (but then The Witcher 3 wasn\u2019t exactly bug-free when it launched).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67c73fb4-1128-4aca-9ae6-91302a15053a": {"__data__": {"id_": "67c73fb4-1128-4aca-9ae6-91302a15053a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7cc8472-e393-425f-a1da-ff21e0803526", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0735368bcab4c7dc660aefce00028406416cb93db1f592bf3e73790178b24a48"}, "3": {"node_id": "103256dc-54f7-4de8-9984-8319a928b938", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3bd9d86024b9f3558cfdfe171d6ea6d74a16213da512bb08f2718c8ca0af76c"}}, "hash": "cb3c1848af64b7ad438175c25303b0f43ab5c99212fb30eca6eeef4090671e1a", "text": "From a design standpoint Cyberpunk has one of the best open world environments ever seen, the action is better than any comparable game, and the side missions are a wonderful mix of poignant, thrilling, and outright bizarre.The problem with the game is that it doesn\u2019t have a strong enough narrative to tie everything together, to the point where it almost feels like two sperate games: one a linear adventure where you have only nominal control over your destiny and the other a much more interesting open world exploration game where you can do and say whatever you want.Perhaps future DLC can meld these two disparate parts together more convincingly, and reduce the more distasteful elements, but even with its problems Cyberpunk is still one of the best games of the year and one that is certain to remain relevant well into the next generation.In Short: A stunning achievement in open world gameplay but one whose tonal inconsistencies and weak narrative undermines what could have been an all-time classic.Pros: An incredibly detailed game world, filled with choice and consequence. Great combat and stealth for an action role-player, with a generally good script and excellent voice-acting. Superb graphics.Cons: More formulaic than it first appears, with most of the ideas having been done before in various similar games.

Find out more about our reviews policy.I've spent more time than I'd like to admit just staring at Night City. At its neon-lit streets, dappled with pink and yellow after rain; at the smoke rising through the elevator shaft in V's apartment building; at the shimmer of chrome running through the arms and faces of NPCs; at the lurid metallics and high-gloss clothing that adorn its citizens; or simply at yet another city-wide vista I've discovered after driving to a new hill in the Badlands. Cyberpunk 2077 is beautiful.\u00a0Release date: November 10, 2020\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\nDeveloper: CD Projekt Red\nPublisher: Bandai NamcoCyberpunk 2077's world is such an aesthetic joy that it feels disrespectful to fast travel or skip drives in Night City. At times, it feels as if the game has transformed into some living, voyeuristic screensaver, such is its ability to distract with its good looks. \u00a0It's not just the way the city comes to life at night either, as the appropriately titled Night City does look ridiculous in the dark \u2013 all neon shimmer and glowing reflections, the headlights of your car carving out a path through the concrete or the dust of the Badlands. Night City brings out the beauty in every slice of the day. But it's always quick to remind you that life within Night City is brutal, raw, and oh so violent. But that's what you're hoping for right? After all, a great setting will only get you so far.\u00a0As you'd expect from the team that brought you The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece of world-building, full of intrigue and distraction that will keep you diving from one quest into another with glee. Quests take various forms, from the Main Jobs to the Side Jobs (which are basically core missions in all but name), down to those that you'll stumble upon like Gigs and Police Scanner Hustles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "103256dc-54f7-4de8-9984-8319a928b938": {"__data__": {"id_": "103256dc-54f7-4de8-9984-8319a928b938", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "67c73fb4-1128-4aca-9ae6-91302a15053a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb3c1848af64b7ad438175c25303b0f43ab5c99212fb30eca6eeef4090671e1a"}, "3": {"node_id": "ffa58fa8-6a44-47f8-9ccf-55c595cc310c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "745182ed11c2932988fe9eb95ae19fb3ffc1bf2b060487147368f03d1f3ed945"}}, "hash": "a3bd9d86024b9f3558cfdfe171d6ea6d74a16213da512bb08f2718c8ca0af76c", "text": "What all of that results in is a map that's a mess of icons, which can initially feel overwhelming, but actually just means that you're rewarded for exploring NIght City. Turning a corner down a side street could offer up anything from shiny cars and bikes for sale or a ripperdoc clinic to dive into for some cyberware enhancements, to the mysterious gigs that only reveal themselves when you get into their proximity and you get a call from the local fixer involved. Night City only gets richer and more enticing the longer you spend in it.\u00a0You'll want to explore everything Cyberpunk 2077 has to offer, because the core campaign is surprisingly short \u2013 should you focus solely on the Main Jobs. Ignore Side Jobs, Gigs, and other Night City lures and you could be looking at a completion time of somewhere in the 15 to 20 hours region. But, you'll also be doing the game a huge disservice by powering through V's core task, so while it's possible, I'd also strongly advise against it.\u00a0What I will say though is that I was genuinely taken aback at facing a 'point of no return' warning in the core campaign that felt like it arrived just as the story was really hitting its stride. CD Projekt Red has said previously that Cyberpunk 2077 is \"slightly shorter\" than the Witcher 3 in an attempt to get more people to see the story through to its conclusion, but this warning felt like it came out of nowhere. However, if finishing The Witcher 3 was a feat that not everyone could achieve, completing Cyberpunk 2077 is an experience that \u2013 hopefully \u2013 a larger majority of players can have. But, more importantly, for what Cyberpunk lacks in campaign length, it more than makes up for with the depth and breadth of the content available in Night City.\u00a0It's here that the Side Jobs are incredibly crucial \u2013 and quite the misnomer. While it's tempting to dismiss them as mere filler, they are campaign arcs in their own right, exploring narratives with core characters that bring light, colour, and complexity to the main story \u2013 not to mention the possibility to influence the ending. While I won't spoil anything for you, it's here that you'll find a different side to Cyberpunk 2077, a more emotional, human side away from the guns, gangs, and gore. You'll become so emotionally invested in these characters that it's easy to become more engrossed in them than V's own plight. There's warmth here, brilliant humour, and an emotional punch that you won't always expect, delivering compelling characters that will no doubt rank as some of the best gaming has to offer. It's the same for the Gigs too, quick-fire mini-quests that act as small distractions from the main story and multiple-hour Side Job arcs. Gigs range from the straightforward to the downright bizarre, and more than once I found myself laughing out loud at the brilliant absurdity of it all.\u00a0Johnny Silverhand, of course, also adds to the game's appeal. Played by Keanu Reeves, Silverhand is your constant companion, commenting on your escapades and the decisions you'll make at every opportunity. He's a bizarre presence, and not always a welcome one, but the rockerboy never fails to add something to a situation. Love him or hate him by the end, there's no doubt you won't have appreciated the rollercoaster that Silverhand provides as you watch the credits scroll.\u00a0How you feel about him though, and any of the characters that stagger into V's life, will always depend on the choices you've made in Cyberpunk 2077. While that starts with the character customisation and your choice of lifepath, it continues until the very last moments of the game. As I mentioned in my preview, while Cyberpunk 2077 offers up the more traditional dialogue choices, it also comes the closest to mimicking human interaction. No longer do you need to \"press X to interact\" with someone, just go up to them and start talking. You can choose to pick up on something else that's happening in the room mid-conversation if you want, speak to someone else for a bit, or simply just walk away. The choices you make may not always cause the story to divert dramatically, but you'll never quite know how far-reaching your decisions are until you've made them.\u00a0That breadth of choice extends to the combat too. You'll find weaponry aplenty in Night City, from a katana called the Black Unicorn to a sniper rifle that can blow people's heads to bits like a particularly pleasing pimple pop, but what you choose to do with them is up to you. The game features a wealth of upgrade trees for abilities and associated perks that let you really dial into the kind of person you want your V to be.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffa58fa8-6a44-47f8-9ccf-55c595cc310c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffa58fa8-6a44-47f8-9ccf-55c595cc310c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "103256dc-54f7-4de8-9984-8319a928b938", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3bd9d86024b9f3558cfdfe171d6ea6d74a16213da512bb08f2718c8ca0af76c"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f397c7a-b067-4a26-a339-3f2044c3b374", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "afa94ffbb7764f8a21337baf938afc9f51533544a587f94e09f65a9ef1969b11"}}, "hash": "745182ed11c2932988fe9eb95ae19fb3ffc1bf2b060487147368f03d1f3ed945", "text": "Prefer a stealth option? Put your perk points into improving your netrunner and cyberware abilities so you can set an enemy on fire from a safe distance. Want to become an elite shotgun specialist? There are plenty of perks for that. Initially, the wealth of options within the perks can feel overwhelming, but the more you play, the easier it becomes to tweak and enhance the things you want to be proficient in.\u00a0The switch to FPS from the RPG format of The Witcher 3 is a huge change too. But CD Projekt Red has done a great job making the combat always feel rewarding. It's not quite as nuanced as The Witcher 3, but you'll feel the benefits and differences not only between each gun type, but also individual weapons \u2013 you'll soon have your favourites, trust me. For me it's the ability to mix cyberware-powered hacking and enhancements (like legs that let you double jump) with gunplay that's the real draw, allowing you to balance stealth and hands-off attacks with the option to quickly switch tactics as needed. You can go full-melee if you want - I'd fully recommend the mantis blades - but that would require a decent amount of prep work and strategy, learning how best to block and manage your stamina to avoid being taken down immediately.Even after 50+ hours with Cyberpunk 2077, which includes seeing my first ending and completing all the main side quests, I still feel like I have plenty to see in Night City. Gigs still litter the map, fixers still call me for help, and I've not even started my car collection yet. Even after all this time, I can't get enough of Night City, and thankfully very little has gotten in the way of experiencing it. The only bugs I've encountered to date have mostly been visual - like missing vehicles, floating weapons, or random stuck menu bars - and have been easily fixed with a quick save and reload. Plus, all of which have been promised to be patched out with the Day One patch that's yet to drop.\u00a0What has been an absolute joy though is experiencing Cyberpunk 2077 at full Ultra Ray-Tracing setting via the Nvidia RTX 3080. Having started the review on an RTX 2070 Super running the game on Ray-Tracing Medium settings, the jump up to the Ultra settings felt like switching on a realism mode that I've not seen before in games. The additional levels of fidelity offered by ray-tracing for the shadows and reflections meant I was constantly peering into mirrors and inspecting the city shining back to me in the bonnet of my Porsche. It's hard to overstate just how good Cyberpunk 2077 looks on PC, and although this won't be the options available to everyone, this is the best graphical experience gaming has to offer right now.\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077 is a paragon of open-world gaming, offering the kind of freedom to explore and define your character that provides a new pinnacle for the genre. It takes everything we celebrate about open-world games, and learns from it, implementing best-in-class variations in a world that's so dense and detailed. Add in the human-like level of reactivity and emotional depth that it brings to its narrative, and it all combines for the most spectacular experience.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nGame Informer, Cyberpunk 2077 hosts a massive sandbox filled to the brim with politically charged conflicts catalyzed by powerful people. Protagonist V might grace the game\u2019s box art, but the hero is overshadowed by Night City\u2019s towering skyscrapers and intriguing citizens. From sunny beaches to gloomy landfills, Night City feels alive even when you\u2019re not around to witness every shady transaction or police investigation. At least, it does when you\u2019re not playing Cyberpunk 2077 on last-gen hardware.On high-end PCs, the allure of interacting with VIPs and coasting down neon-bright boulevards is on full display, despite Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s notorious glitches. Chromatic implants glisten in dark hotel rooms, flickering lightbars boast picture-perfect reflections in rain puddles, and character models are particularly striking. However, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Cyberpunk 2077 are marred by several additional bugs and ugly visuals. Overall, my extended stay in Night City was unpleasant, and a far cry from the experience PC players have described.Even after I decluttered my screen by disabling film grain and many of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s other graphical features (these options don\u2019t noticeably enhance the visuals when kept active), the look of the game remained the same: Drab and dreary. The colors are drained of vibrance \u2013 vehicle paint jobs, flashy jumbotrons, even the sun\u2019s rays. NPCs are poorly rendered and appear as indiscernible shapes. And surfaces have flat textures that are obvious at most draw distances. It\u2019s hard to enjoy the interactivity of Night City when quest givers or companions are polygonal blobs, and that sweet sportscar you spent a small fortune on is just a blurry object with pallid wheels. Eventually, these textures load, but by then, the damage to immersion has already been done.Framerate drops are a common occurrence and tend to disrupt basic exploration and action sequences. In densely populated districts like Watson and Heywood, you\u2019re often forced to stop as the hardware attempts to manage the myriad NPCs and traffic jams. I\u2019ve also noticed that when driving at high speeds, the game freezes regularly, which can lead to crashes.The spotty enemy A.I. from the PC version carries over here, but trying to fulfill objectives covertly or survive boss encounters can be frustratingly difficult when the frames start to randomly hiccup. On multiple occasions, I\u2019d sneak behind an enemy to incapacitate them, the game would seemingly pause for loading purposes, and then suddenly the guard I was targeting would randomly respawn behind me. Smaller bugs (like T-posed NPCs) stopped happening on a regular basis after CD Projekt Red\u2019s latest hotfix, but game-breaking issues \u2013 weapons not appearing, the scanner being unusable \u2013 forced me to reload saves or restart my console periodically.I can\u2019t help but lament Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s potential. Night City is an ambitious open world. Seaside carnivals give way to bustling marketplaces. Trailer park communities hide in the shadows of glass spires. Meeting new faces is exciting and selecting unique lines of dialogue can even change the outcome of a side quest or relationship.

But appreciating all of that is practically impossible on these consoles; graphics aren\u2019t necessarily the most important part of a game, but in the last-gen versions of Cyberpunk 2077, the visuals and performance are so bad that they neutralize the game\u2019s biggest strengths.Cyberpunk 2077 wasn\u2019t optimized for last-gen consoles, and no amount of interesting side activities can remedy that. On PC, the world lives up to its title as the \u201cCity of Dreams.\u201d For Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players, however, their time in Night City is likely a nightmare.If you have the enhanced versions of last-gen consoles \u2013 PS4 Pro or Xbox One X \u2013 Cyberpunk 2077 is a smoother experience. At the very least, the NPCs look fine and textures are far more detailed, although I spotted occasional pop-in.

All Rights Reserved.\nGame Informer, Cyberpunk 2077 is a work of awe-inspiring ambition, dazzling with its massive scale and creative vision. The world of Night City is a metropolis of futuristic art, stealing your eye with stunning neon-lit architecture and streets filled with citizens made of flesh and metal. Night City is an open world that immediately pulls you in and keeps you engaged with its dark narrative, meaningful player choice, and overwhelming amount of side content.Your lens into this tech-obsessed society is the protagonist simply named V, a cyberpunk who you fully design, including their voice, backstory (which subtly alters the narrative), and even their genitals. I spent far too much time creating my look, even though I rarely saw\u00a0it during play due to the mostly first-person perspective. V is fun to control thanks to immense amounts of cybertech, but is an unlikable lead, spouting off profanity and groan-inducing one-liners, and generally displaying a \u201cscum of the earth\u201d personality.V, while making a mess of conversations, has an interesting story to tell. It goes places I didn\u2019t expect and gets wild toward the end. The narrative hits its stride when V meets Johnny Silverhand, a former terrorist who is now a digital construct that lives in V\u2019s mind. Silverhand\u2019s thoughts and dark ambitions are twisted and dangerous, leading to great conversational choices and decisions that allow players to shape the story and action. The biggest allure of Silverhand is how he\u2019s brought to life by actor Keanu Reeves, who looks and sounds as awesome in the role as he does in any film on the silver screen. Given how wonderful some of the other characters are (with their own long and fantastic arcs), Reeves doesn\u2019t steal the show \u2013 but Silverhand is a constant throughout most of the game and helps save V from being too overbearing.Silverhand will bring a smile to your face, but Cyberpunk 2077 doesn\u2019t have many joyous bones in its body, and is often heavy in the delivery of its dark content. Night City may be vibrant, but it's home mostly to evil people doing terrible things. Some of the content made me uncomfortable, including story moments dealing with abuse and sexual assault. Even the average bystanders sometimes gave me pause, such as a drugged woman being held in place by a man, a setup seen all over the city. Developers should be free to explore all subject matter, but it sometimes feels careless in Cyberpunk 2077 \u2013 more like edgy set-dressing than meaningful commentary.Much like V\u2019s inability to think clearly with Silverhand clouding the mind, Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s story often has different tones, and is all over the place from mission to mission. In one side story, V may come across as likable and mature. In the next, V suddenly sounds like an angsty teenager again (the tone you hear most). It\u2019s hit or miss, but most quests deliver awesome moments, particularly when new NPCs are introduced.

I don\u2019t know how many dozens (or hundreds) of hours of side content are around it, but the mission log just keeps growing as you play. While the main story sequences often end with cliffhangers that demand resolution and the thought that you should continue on that path, the best way to experience Cyberpunk 2077 is to see what the city has to offer. Walk into a crowded market, explore a mysterious question mark on your map, and take on the side missions that the denizens are offering \u2013 just surrender yourself to moment-to-moment discovery.CD Projekt Red wants you to soak in the beauty of the world, but also demands you spend plenty of time in menus assigning new abilities, crafting, and sorting through heaps of loot. That isn\u2019t a knock against the game. It\u2019s all handled quite well. Any room you enter could have numerous items to pick up, as well as world-building text you can read. The amount of leveling you can do is immense, which is reflected on sprawling ability charts that take considerable amounts of time to fill out. If you only focus on the critical path, you barely scratch the surface of the abilities, which carry significant advantages to combat, stealth, hacking, and dialogue. It\u2019s amazing how much you can improve and expand upon V\u2019s standard attributes. I also love how doing various things helps improve V in those fields.Using cyberware and abilities to mess with enemies is good fun, such as cooking a grenade in an enemy's pocket. Hacking cameras and activating devices from afar to distract foes makes stealth satisfying. I enjoyed creeping through environments, hacking the cameras and turrets as I went. I leaned more on stealth than expected, partially because I didn\u2019t find the gunplay enthralling. The weapons you obtain feel awesome (and give good reason to track down the legendary and iconic versions), but the enemy A.I. isn\u2019t great, leading to headshots being delivered like they are going out of style. Some enemies think they are hidden behind thin railings, others charge foolishly toward you and then stop without any cover around them. Harder missions (which are nicely indicated on the log) are a little more intense given the spike in difficulty, but the adversaries are still easy to manipulate, unless they are an aggressive boss or cyber ninja that crowds you quickly.Johnny Silverhand sadly isn\u2019t the only glitch in Cyberpunk 2077. Not since The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim have I played a game that is riddled with so many graphical bugs at launch. The danger of entering a seedy bar loses its bite when one of its patrons stands motionless in a T-pose. A high-speed motorcycle chase down a highway is far less intense than it should be when an NPC biker shakes so much he looks like a blur. Little visual hitches in the environment and characters occur frequently, and they\u2019re jarring, but I rarely ran into anything that affected gameplay. The only major issues I experienced were I could no longer look down the sight of my guns during one mission \u2013 reloading my save fixed the issue. I also had a digitized visual effect remain after a cutscene. Again, I had to reload and replay a sequence to get the proper outcome. Regardless, the frequency of the odd visual moments hurts immersion, and can outright ruin a suspenseful moment.Cyberpunk 2077 is dark and disturbing at times (frighteningly so), but the majority of its content is fascinating, and loaded with depth through the various RPG systems and lore. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Night City, and Johnny Silverhand is a great partner to see the sights with. Cyberpunk 2077 doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome with its critical-path story, and invites players to jack in and stay for hundreds of hours of unique content should they want to. It didn't blow me away like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, but is still a hell of an opening to what will hopefully be a new series.As of this writing, the best way to experience Cyberpunk 2077 is on a high-end gaming PC. That\u2019s how I played for this review, but I also saw how the game performs on various PlayStation and Xbox machines.

The newest project from The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red, it was promoted as a sea change in video games that would merge the deep history of R. Talsorian Games\u2019 sprawling cyberpunk Night City with storytelling chops that made Geralt\u2019s adventures in The Witcher so compelling for so many of us. It was all portrayed in first-person perspective, to really sell us on our protagonist V\u2019s embodied relationship with the world around them.But in a move typical for the cyberpunk genre, there was a stark difference between the hype and the actual thing. The game landed with a dull thud, the stark reality of which could be blamed on any number of factors called out by reviewers and players: plodding cyberpunk gameplay, the general emptiness of the world, and a lack of compelling narrative. Over all of this loomed a series of technical problems that quickly transformed Cyberpunk 2077 into a generator of glitchy memes and exposed a rushed game produced under distressing crunch conditions. Substantial performance errors prompted its removal from Sony\u2019s PlayStation Store, and the intervening months have been a slow crawl of CD Projekt fixing, adding, and tweaking the game in incremental updates \u2014 an extensive bid to bring it in line with its marketing promises.Now, 16 months later, the prevailing question I am still regularly asked is, \u201cIs Cyberpunk 2077 \u2018good\u2019 now?\u201dIn February 2022, CD Projekt released a substantial patch, version 1.5, for Cyberpunk 2077. It contains a large number of tweaks and fixes, some new content, and native support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Reading the patch notes is a lengthy time commitment, but the general gist is that CD Projekt has overhauled some part of nearly every game system in Cyberpunk 2077, from combat AI, to player stat functions, to the economy, to the way that vehicles work. These big post-release swings are not unfamiliar to the developer, since it performed similar system and world overhauls with the second and third Witcher games. However, this is the first time that a single patch has had the weight of \u201cfixing\u201d an entire game on its back. It is a heavy weight, and I\u2019d be lying if I said that having to evaluate how \u201cfixed\u201d the game is did not weigh on me heavily as I booted the game up on Playstation 5 once it was re-launched back in February.\n    Related\n  In the weeks since, I have leisurely played through Cyberpunk 2077 for the first time. My eyes are as fresh as they can be, since I skipped the initial game to wait for the inevitable second swing. My verdict, put shortly, if you\u2019re looking for the soundbite: Cyberpunk 2077 is now a pretty good game.It works. It takes place in a world that seems to be the one that everyone anticipated at launch. People are living their lives in the massive Night City, and the player character V is just another character caught up in a process of trying to get a little bit higher in the hierarchy. You can wander from dirty streets to perfect skyline suites in the megatowers without much fuss, and the various missions thread V like a needle through these political realities rendered into spatial forms, the same way that any other piece of cyberpunk media does (thanks, Fredric Jameson). Based on reading reviews of the original Cyberpunk 2077and comparing it to my experience of completing the new Cyberpunk 2077 over the past few days, it seems that a key difference between pre- and post-1.5 is one of intensity. At launch, CD Projekt seemed to nail scale, in that the world was massive and appropriately futuristic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d5e6a9f-4a57-468b-aa76-14b94fb9c30f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d5e6a9f-4a57-468b-aa76-14b94fb9c30f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa00c301-fedb-416a-8a11-14f0db85aa39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "207f62b8b97876febd170618475ec13f924f031aca4daf711f3e4167090948d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "64db7643-5dde-4fd3-9d7f-7bb357e4e6ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2179ec4a48833c78f76b1a74359fde73a02033c0238017354c5d23bcccf36a24"}}, "hash": "9635164b3b4311339844861e29bddc5840a448e606d9d1525ac5d4bca6ec84d7", "text": "What it fumbled was a sense of density, a feeling that this big world contained functioning people \u2014 other than the player character \u2014 going about their business. The game world lacked a sense of weight, as if everything existed merely for the illusion of there being a city here rather than an evocation of a real metropolis, with shops and stalls and cyberpunk criminals and their entire network of economic relations. It is a strange marker of current video game culture that this is the thing that we most desire, since by definition the entirety of a video game environment is a technical illusion to make a player feel important. The people on the sidewalk in any given game are not there to be full people. They are there to give context, and a certain aesthetic feeling, to a player speeding by them in a souped-up future car. If there is a key maneuver in patch 1.5, it is that these fantasies seem to be fulfilled. NPCs interact minimally with their environment, and they panic when gunfire starts nearby. They behave \u201crealistically,\u201d and like most of the non-player content in the game, seem to be a drastic leap forward from the videos you might remember from the disturbingly gleeful \u201clook at this shit\u201d responses that highlighted technical problems in 2020. The combat also seems markedly different from the initial release. I played as a very technical boy, infecting enemies with powered-up hacks into their vital organs while I stalked around the combat zone. It was very clear to me how my strategy differed from the others on offer, giving me a feeling of being a razor blade tactically working through groups of foes. When my more elegant skills weren\u2019t up to the task, I could always go at my cybernetic enemies with a baseball bat. The gunplay, which often feels inevitable at many junctures, has more of the flavor of a warmed-over Far Cry with some weapon concepts, like assault rifles with tracking bullets, that felt lifted directly out of 2012\u2019s Syndicate. While there is an entire weapon upgrade system, with a large number of materials to gather and source, the game\u2019s content is paced in such a way that another, better weapon is always dropping off an enemy corpse, trivializing the entire system. As a scavenger lord who enjoyed playing that way, I value this as an excellent way to experience a lot of weapon types. I can imagine a more tactical gamer finding this frustrating.One of the big hopes that I, and many others, had for Cyberpunk 2077 rested in how it might approach storytelling in its science-fictional universe. The Witcher games are successful at building up its core cast of characters and putting them in positions where we get a sense of them as three-dimensional humans, with thoughts and feelings and complications that are rarely represented within video games. The decision to make this cyberpunk game within the Cyberpunk brand identity meant that this game could build on the deep history of this world developed by Mike Pondsmith in the R. Talsorian Games Cyberpunk setting for more than 30 years.CD Projekt\u2019s promotional material took pains to tell you about Night City and all of that history, locating V within this nest of relationships before players even got their hands on the product. This world history, and the players in it, are what give context to the open world and its various zones and factions. It matters that you understand that Night City is sliced up by a dozen different groups, each with their own desires for the future and traditions that they keep alive. In turn, those groups provide a backdrop against which we understand the game\u2019s primary characters like Johnny Silverhand, Panam Palmer, or the Arasaka corporate family. As a genre, cyberpunk is often exploring questions of who is constrained by what, and novels like Bruce Sterling\u2019s Islands in the Net or William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer operate partially on the thrill of watching their characters break through the social, economic, and technical walls that have captured them.The mode here is (unsurprisingly) just like that of The Witcher: The main character, V, is shaped by how the player interacts with the other characters in various situations, where difficult decisions have to be made in a nightmarish world of violence where the lights are bright and life is cheap.\n    Related\n  However, the created-character nature of V, and the various backgrounds that V can be from (like a Nomad or a Corporate stooge) give Cyberpunk 2077 more of a Mass Effect vibe. The other characters are strongly drawn, with their own questlines, and when V enters their orbit, everyone\u2019s life changes in some tangible, notable way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64db7643-5dde-4fd3-9d7f-7bb357e4e6ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "64db7643-5dde-4fd3-9d7f-7bb357e4e6ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d5e6a9f-4a57-468b-aa76-14b94fb9c30f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9635164b3b4311339844861e29bddc5840a448e606d9d1525ac5d4bca6ec84d7"}, "3": {"node_id": "6740ed2c-d375-4fbf-ae23-0ee35b76ee9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad2999c2469c8324b0b219e865bd64dcf3bf5fa6c319a00542fdef8dc2e4ac5d"}}, "hash": "2179ec4a48833c78f76b1a74359fde73a02033c0238017354c5d23bcccf36a24", "text": "From a broad perspective, this works in that Mass Effect mode where my understanding of V allowed me to make decisions from their perspective, but there is something lost in the \u201cplayer-created\u201d nature of V. While Night City has a big cast of characters with their own history with the place, the unwillingness to locate V firmly within that place means that everything sort of washes over me as a player. When Geralt met a new character or visited a new location in The Witcher 3, he always knew a little something about the context he was entering into, and my work as a player was to guide him through it and learn what I could. V, without a firm history, glides from mission to mission and place to place without much connection, knowing only what a questgiver tells them. For such a specific place and a specific time, so many of the things I did in the game ended up feeling generic. This is, frankly, astonishing to me.Even the design elements CD Projekt has deployed to check this dislocated feeling work in strange ways. I chose the Corporate background, which meant the game began with my firing from Arasaka corp, and I had some additional dialogue options whenever corporate politics became the focus. However, early in the game, that merely unlocked sarcastic or manipulative dialogue responses, allowing me to get deeper into a convo with my corporate-speak; by the end of the game, those same Corpo dialogue choices became almost entirely about obedience and pro-corporate approaches. This switch midstream of what a game mechanic does ultimately produces a situation where I could not make assumptions or assertions about V to give them a role-playing grounding on my own terms. This robbed many late-game moments of the gravity they might have had.If there is a strength to be found in this narrative form, it lies in its characters and the struggles you help them through, including Johnny Silverhand, a construct that is trapped in V\u2019s head. The entire plot of the game revolves around trying to eject Johnny, since the chip that trapped him there is slowly killing V. While there are some truly compelling gameplay moments that happen around this mixed-up biopsyche, such as segments where Silverhand controls V\u2019s body and gets involved in rock and roll shenanigans, Silverhand (and Keanu Reeves\u2019 performance) are eclipsed by more marginal characters like the idealist detective River or the aging fixer Rogue. There\u2019s not a single character in Cyberpunk 2077 that isn\u2019t a cyberpunk genre stereotype that has been picked over for 50 years to the point of triteness. But both the writing and performances for these characters had me engaged enough that I was always waiting for another of their missions to unlock.As I finished four of the game\u2019s endings, I told a friend that Cyberpunk 2077 felt weirdly like a holdover from another era of game design. At its core, it feels like a well executed Mass Effect welded onto a Far Cry; the narrative designs of the former feel layered on top of the hostile encounter, open-world nodes of the latter. Where The Witcher 3 was synthesizing a lot of pre-existing game ideas to make something unique, Cyberpunk 2077 is less coherent as an object on its own. You can play at the seams and feel the staples holding it all together. At this point, post-1.5, the most notable points of friction no longer feel like the result of development foibles or a lack of time. Instead, they feel like part of the game\u2019s DNA \u2014 the faults that were there before any problems in final execution.It is worth thinking here about the decisions behind a major patch like this, which focuses almost entirely on the technical and gameplay sides of the game. There\u2019s been no attempt to soften or explore the cyberpunk genre\u2019s deployment of techno-orientalism in its treatment of Asian culture and characters, which is a huge missed opportunity in a game that spends so much time ruminating on the mistakes of the past, and how one might repair them. A transphobic ad is still plastered across nearly every surface in the game, monopolizing vision in a way that does not even line up with real-world advertising practices. With this game\u2019s long tail of updates, there are seemingly infinite chances to go deeper, to rethink some assumptions, and to engage with the genre at least as fully as its founding texts did. Yet none of these things were deemed patch-worthy. It is more substantive, apparently, to make sure there are new apartments and cars and guns.While patch 1.5 works, and it brings Cyberpunk 2077 up to whatever minimum standard people thought it should have been up to at launch.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6740ed2c-d375-4fbf-ae23-0ee35b76ee9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "6740ed2c-d375-4fbf-ae23-0ee35b76ee9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "64db7643-5dde-4fd3-9d7f-7bb357e4e6ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2179ec4a48833c78f76b1a74359fde73a02033c0238017354c5d23bcccf36a24"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab5f5642-c6d7-4a8d-9be0-6300b0061ec1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a6d9b7f457bcd34021de79c2ef2824caf1db98ce31895db317821f2cdfd168cd"}}, "hash": "ad2999c2469c8324b0b219e865bd64dcf3bf5fa6c319a00542fdef8dc2e4ac5d", "text": "Playing the game for the first time now makes it clear that that high watermark is merely serviceable, and that the basic ideas in Cyberpunk 2077 are good enough to pass the time, but not enough to be truly great, or even a substantive look at the genre the game clings to.

We did not receive console code until the game\u2019s Dec. 10 release date. Having since spent time with the game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, we have noticed significant differences in visual fidelity and performance between the console and PC versions. The following review reflects our experience on PC. We strongly discourage readers from playing Cyberpunk 2077 on consoles until the game has been dramatically improved via software patches.]Viewed from a distance \u2014 say, from the vast desert outskirts known as the Badlands \u2014 Night City looks like a beacon, so massive and promising in its potential that many denizens of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s brutal future see it as a place where they might escape their hardscrabble lives and fulfill their dreams. And yet, as the game reminds us again and again, those who come to Night City seeking a better life often find only hardship, struggle, and loneliness. Like the city in which it is set, Cyberpunk 2077 may give off one impression when regarded from afar, one carefully constructed through years of marketing hype, but once players experience it up close, they\u2019ll find that the truth is something else. On one hand, it\u2019s a more earnest and sincere game than all its edgy marketing has suggested. On the other, though the word cyberpunk evokes a radical vision of the future, there\u2019s nothing revolutionary on offer here. Instead, it\u2019s a game obsessed with the past.Before you hit the streets of Night City, you\u2019ll construct your version of the game\u2019s central character, V, in a process indicative of one of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s most glaring problems. For whatever reason, among all the hairstyles and eyes and makeup and tattoos you might expect, genitals are included as part of the character creation process, with two penis options \u2014 and three size settings for each! \u2014 and one vagina. (You can also opt not to select genitals at all, always viewing your V in panties or boxers at a bare minimum.) Ahead of the release of Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red faced\u00a0scrutiny from reporters for its work practices, particularly with regard to \u201ccrunch,\u201d a term referring to long overtime hours lasting weeks or months. Despite past promises to the contrary, the company imposed\u00a0obligatory crunch\u00a0on some employees. Cyberpunk 2077 also faced criticism for its marketing \u2014 in particular, the usage of a\u00a0sexualized trans model in a promotional poster, as well as\u00a0the flippant tone used in much of the game\u2019s advertising and social media.Even after release, Cyberpunk 2077 remains a work in progress for CD Projekt Red.

You can create a dude with a vagina or a lady with a penis, that\u2019s no problem. But because of everything else about how the game handles trans identity, this hardly feels like the progressive step it should be. Rather than just letting you pick your pronouns independently of all your other character creation choices, your pronouns are assigned based on your selection of voice: Pick the \u201cfeminine\u201d voice and your pronouns are she/her, and vice versa. (There are no nonbinary pronoun options.) As a trans woman with a voice that many would not describe as \u201cfeminine,\u201d this direct linking of gender identity to having a voice that sounds \u201cmasculine\u201d or \u201cfeminine\u201d feels weirdly essentializing. I could have forgiven it if the rest of the game took strides to humanize trans identities, but boy, it sure doesn\u2019t. Ubiquitous throughout Night City are ads for a beverage called Chromanticure that feature a female-coded model with a penis visible through her skintight clothing, making it clear that in Cyberpunk 2077, trans bodies are objectified and commodified. Some cis bodies are, too, of course, but the crucial difference is that, as V, we constantly meet, interact with, and form relationships with cis characters who have far more dimension than the surface of any sexualized image on a billboard. The same can\u2019t be said of trans characters. Even if you opt to play as a trans V, she\u2019s not particularly well-defined. The game is about what you see through her eyes and what she goes through, not about who she is as a person.In my 40-plus hours in Night City, I never met a single character of any significance whom the game made clear was trans, and one of the only queer-coded characters I encountered was an extremely unsavory cybernetic surgeon who does extremely unsavory things. I did spot a trans flag on one character\u2019s vehicle, though that hardly counts as positive trans representation and doesn\u2019t even necessarily mean the character is trans. It felt more like a way for Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s creators to say they had included positive trans representation without actually putting thought into it or making trans people a visible part of the makeup of Night City. I get that Cyberpunk\u2019s dark future is intended not as a goal, but as something for humanity to avoid. As Mike Pondsmith, creator of the Cyberpunk tabletop game, has put it, \u201cThe Cyberpunk future is a warning; not an aspiration.\u201d There\u2019s real potential for a grim world like the one Cyberpunk 2077 offers to serve as a lens through which our own world is critiqued, but the developers at CD Projekt Red failed to do anything with the trans options and identities they incorporated into the game to make them function in this way, and as V, you never have the option to say or do anything about it. The objectification of trans people is just background texture, nothing more.For elements like the inescapable dehumanization of trans people on imagery throughout the city to function as any kind of critique of transphobia, the game itself would need to create tension around those images by showing us humanized trans people navigating that world. But it doesn\u2019t. The result is a game in which transphobic players (of which there will be many) can just laugh at us by using the character creator to generate models they consider worthy of mockery and derision and by gagging at the Chromanticure ads they see everywhere, or perhaps by fetishizing the model while continuing to see trans people as objects of desire but not as full human beings. Meanwhile, we trans players are left wanting in its world for depictions that humanize us. Here in 2020, people boldly and bravely hack gender all the time. And yes, I know that Cyberpunk 2077 takes place on a separate timeline in which the year 2020 looked very different than it does for us, but it\u2019s still a world in which people push their bodies to the extreme of technological modification, sometimes swapping out eyes or limbs like they\u2019re changing clothes. You\u2019d think transgressing gender norms would be pretty commonplace, too, and that as a result, a fundamentally different understanding of gender and of trans identity would have taken root in the world.As deeply unfortunate as this is, it\u2019s but one facet of Cyberpunk 2077, a game that demands to be reckoned with in all of its messy, multifaceted entirety.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab1120d0-136f-425f-9eca-487b7e58c5de": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab1120d0-136f-425f-9eca-487b7e58c5de", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab5f5642-c6d7-4a8d-9be0-6300b0061ec1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a6d9b7f457bcd34021de79c2ef2824caf1db98ce31895db317821f2cdfd168cd"}, "3": {"node_id": "5717b038-8cd3-440f-bcb8-7a6967069a83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "31607985619ac577afd0a539065b1507351c00f4879acd1f7912d4619aba55eb"}}, "hash": "671a1341c3441462dae19685ba1a5f96eaf0733543ebdd41bb0e86e2b15ec445", "text": "V may be the central character of the game, but unlike Geralt in CD Projekt Red\u2019s previous game, The Witcher 3, she is not the star. No, the star is Night City itself, vast and intricate, intimidating and awe-inspiring. To its credit, the Night City of Cyberpunk 2077 is not just an amalgamation of imagery lifted from other influential sources, but an original creation that incorporates many signifiers of cyberpunk genre flavor (lots of Japanese kanji in neon, airships slowly drifting through the sky) while also feeling like a place we haven\u2019t seen before.Steam may issue forth from every surface, but this isn\u2019t the shadowy aesthetic allure of Blade Runner. Night City is something altogether uglier and more chaotic than that, with its skyline of awkward megabuildings resembling a landscape assembled by a child out of chunky toy blocks. Drawing on the timeline of the metropolis as established across multiple generations of the tabletop role-playing game, the cluttered, ramshackle feel of the city\u2019s districts makes sense given its history as a place that has seen tremendous destruction and upheaval, and is never all that far removed from the most recent crisis that necessitated massive rebuilding efforts.This turbulent history isn\u2019t just something you feel in the look and design of the city. It\u2019s something the narrative brings to thrilling life, too. You don\u2019t need to be familiar with the specifics of Cyberpunk\u2019s timeline going into Cyberpunk 2077 to appreciate all the ways in which your time in Night City is textured by a richly detailed past. Whether you\u2019re passing through derelict maglev tunnels that speak to generations of abandoned infrastructure or you\u2019re witnessing the violent rise of tensions that have been brewing in one of the world\u2019s most powerful corporations for generations, Night City feels like much more than just a backdrop for a cyberpunk-flavored open-world adventure. Nothing in Cyberpunk 2077 brings you into closer contact with Night City\u2019s storied past than Johnny Silverhand, the once-legendary rock star whose digitized consciousness takes up residence in your head via a highly sought-after biochip you slot into your brain during a heist gone sideways. Johnny is central to some of the biggest upheavals in Night City history, and as you carry the cybernetic construct of his personality around with you, playable flashbacks thrust you into that history, giving you a taste both of the blur of sex, drugs, and rock n\u2019 roll that made up much of his life, and of the anticorporate actions that have him branded as a terrorist in some people\u2019s eyes.In the Cyberpunk tabletop RPG, one of the playable classes is the rockerboy, a term for any musician or artist whose work stirs up public sentiment against evil corporations or other social ills. To me, the rockerboys are the one thing that prevents Cyberpunk as a property from being wholly defined by cynicism and violence. There\u2019s something earnest and hopeful about the fact that the tabletop game wants players to see themselves not just as heavily armed solos and skilled netrunners, but also as artists whose creative output has the potential to change the world for the better. Of course, you can\u2019t play as a rockerboy in Cyberpunk 2077, because V is a merc by trade, but that earnest ideology is still present in Johnny. Even if it\u2019s covered up by layers of affected detachment, he\u2019s still prone to reminiscing about the old days by saying grandiose things like this: \u201cWe fought for beauty. Not knowin\u2019 what was good or true, was only the beautiful that meant a damn thing to us.\u201dThis is what I least expected about Cyberpunk 2077: that its notions of \u201ccool\u201d are so tied up in the digital persona of a past-his-prime rocker that the game sometimes feels like looking through your uncle\u2019s musty record collection while he talks about how great the Rolling Stones are. When William Gibson\u2019s genre-defining novels like Neuromancer and Count Zero first appeared in the mid-\u201980s, they were thrilling in part because they offered a vision of the future that felt entirely new, and with it, a whole new vision of \u201ccool.\u201d I believe there\u2019s still potential for cyberpunk stories to be so boldly visionary and relevant, but Cyberpunk 2077 prefers to look back, an attitude reflected not just through Johnny\u2019s efforts to avenge old grudges and to recapture the glory days of his band Samurai.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5717b038-8cd3-440f-bcb8-7a6967069a83": {"__data__": {"id_": "5717b038-8cd3-440f-bcb8-7a6967069a83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab1120d0-136f-425f-9eca-487b7e58c5de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "671a1341c3441462dae19685ba1a5f96eaf0733543ebdd41bb0e86e2b15ec445"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce0561ab-ac22-41bf-9082-8a23b91b88c4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "874f8058cac8d2e2c0a7c88ca7d91cacffdba632c4f6e6ed7b727e2ecb2366ee"}}, "hash": "31607985619ac577afd0a539065b1507351c00f4879acd1f7912d4619aba55eb", "text": "In fact, the game\u2019s entire worldview feels like the product of someone who\u2019s about 30 years behind the times, who may have been rebellious and liberated once but who nowadays doesn\u2019t understand why it\u2019s messed up to call sex workers \u201cwhores,\u201d as Johnny routinely does.Johnny is played, of course, by Keanu Reeves, and I can\u2019t imagine anyone else in the role. Johnny is an asshole, with an ego as big as Night City, whose every word is uttered as if it\u2019s so important that the whole world should take heed. But with Reeves\u2019 charisma in play, this nigh-insufferable character remains just barely sufferable. Full disclosure: I\u2019m a huge Keanu Reeves fan. I think there\u2019s a vulnerability to him that makes even characters like John Wick, who in other hands might feel completely inaccessible and irredeemable, recognizably human. So it is here, too. Reeves\u2019 natural tendencies as an actor help offset the worst tendencies of the character he\u2019s playing, such that we can still understand, if only barely, why his old bandmates and other associates put up with him at all. This game isn\u2019t the best vehicle for Reeves\u2019 work, because while he provides both voice-over and motion capture for Johnny, there\u2019s sometimes a disconnect between the two, moments where the animations Johnny performs don\u2019t quite reflect the urgency or intensity of what he\u2019s saying. And yet, I was always glad to walk into some dimly lit motel room or exclusive bar and find Johnny lurking in the corner, visible only to V, ready with some world-weary quip. Night City may be the star of Cyberpunk 2077, but Johnny Silverhand is its soul \u2014 weathered, outmoded, often tiresome, yet still weirdly compelling.There is one thing Cyberpunk 2077 gets right about the genre from which it takes its name: Many of the best cyberpunk stories are heist stories. They\u2019re stories of planning and logistics, with lots of moving pieces and key players, each one bringing their own crucial skills to the mix. The game is at its best when it leans hard into this, as it does in the opening hours, which take their time introducing a number of accomplices and have you all laying the groundwork for the big job that brings V into contact with Johnny and sets the rest of the plot in motion. One of the great strengths of The Witcher 3 was that it really took its time with people and relationships. Similarly, Cyberpunk 2077 isn\u2019t afraid to slow down for both plot and character development. Those tightly plotted early hours in particular, with their clandestine meetings at which characters obsess over gathering intel and acquiring all the necessary gear to accomplish an audacious crime, pull you into V\u2019s life as a merc with her eyes on joining the exclusive ranks of Night City\u2019s criminal elite.But what about the nuts-and-bolts stuff of doing V\u2019s work? Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s combat is fine, but other games, particularly the two Deus Ex games of the past decade, have much more effectively delivered on the fantasy of being a cybernetically augmented individual whose abilities enable them to approach situations in a number of creative and rewarding ways. Here, sneaking your way through gang-infested warehouses or corporate lobbies, you can hack objects to distract enemies or short-circuit their optics to blind them temporarily, but these abilities feel pretty tame compared to the opportunities for zany, emergent hacking mayhem offered in games like Watch Dogs: Legion.Guns in Cyberpunk 2077 do have a hefty, nasty brutality to them, and there\u2019s some fleeting novelty in doing things like charging up a shot on a \u201cpower\u201d weapon to blast an enemy through cover, but I had hoped for a more distinctive cyberpunk flavor in my Cyberpunk combat. Even the hacking minigame that you have to complete when performing certain actions is dead simple, and never did the game try to replicate the thrill of really hacking the \u2019net the way I\u2019ve been dreaming of doing since I first read Neuromancer long ago. At a certain point I started finding katanas with pretty ridiculous damage output, after which my approach to combat (playing on the recommended Hard difficulty setting) often involved just rushing enemies and slashing them to bits, which provided a certain frenetic fun. The combat, while serviceable, isn\u2019t a reason in and of itself for anyone to play this game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce0561ab-ac22-41bf-9082-8a23b91b88c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce0561ab-ac22-41bf-9082-8a23b91b88c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "5717b038-8cd3-440f-bcb8-7a6967069a83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "31607985619ac577afd0a539065b1507351c00f4879acd1f7912d4619aba55eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7423985-9a8e-4574-96d1-7f7c486108a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8082c4d6ef848d5bcbeb44e8e4b279ccb7e33cc09ebca6c34d13f0dec46fe4ee"}}, "hash": "874f8058cac8d2e2c0a7c88ca7d91cacffdba632c4f6e6ed7b727e2ecb2366ee", "text": "The reason to play is for the world and its people.Along with its use of heist structure, the other thing Cyberpunk 2077 gets right about the best cyberpunk stories is that cyberspace and other genre trappings should be more than just plot devices; they should be ways to explore ideas like mortality, identity, spirituality, and transcendence. With a construct of Johnny Silverhand lodged in V\u2019s brain, slowly overwriting her identity, these philosophical concerns are built right into the narrative, as it sometimes becomes unclear where one character ends and the other begins. Unfortunately, Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s main storyline doesn\u2019t quite stick the landing. It reaches for big meaning in the end, but the result is more muddled and confusing than mysterious. Thankfully, surrounding the main storyline are a few substantial side quests with better payoffs. V can choose to help out a brilliant young techie who wants to put a group of exploited sex workers in charge of their own club, or a strong-willed nomad and her clan out in the Badlands. I was always grateful for any excuse to venture out into the spare beauty of the Badlands, those wide-open spaces a welcome antidote to the claustrophobic crush of Night City.One of my fears about Cyberpunk 2077 was that it was going to be so cynical and nihilistic that playing it would be like wallowing in grim hopelessness, that the cheapness of human life in the game\u2019s world would be mirrored by the game itself. But that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s easy to lose the human thread in the overwhelming glut of stuff Cyberpunk 2077 puts on your plate, with your map plastered with crimes you can violently \u201cneutralize\u201d for a reward from the police, and fixers constantly sending you text messages about underdeveloped one-off jobs you can take on to earn a bit of extra cash. But the humanity is there, if you look for it.And that humanity is the saving grace of this alluring yet uneven and deeply flawed game. I can\u2019t deny that Night City wowed me with its scale, its verticality, and its sense of history. But I wish I could see people like me on its streets as something more than objects. I wish that the game\u2019s politics were more radical. Yes, I know I shouldn\u2019t look to a colossal game that was itself produced under exploitative labor conditions to lead the charge of anticapitalist liberation, but I wish the sparks of Johnny Silverhand\u2019s ideological rage got to burn brighter, that Cyberpunk 2077 felt more interested in envisioning new futures than in reminiscing over bygone glories. Neither its gameplay nor its narrative can imagine the bold possibilities that I find so central to the best of cyberpunk. But what it does offer is visions of people trying to make do and get by in a world that\u2019s trying to eat them alive, and sometimes those people get by with a little help from their friends. It\u2019s not the revolution I hoped for, but it\u2019s something.

It's one of the best minor questlines in the game, an intriguing and surprisingly human substory that rewards you with lots of much-needed cash. It's also an excuse to send you to every corner of Night City, a clever introduction to all the areas you haven't yet been.I spent a lot of my playtime following side-quest threads like this one, excited about the premise and hoping to find something as interesting or fun or rewarding at the end and, in many cases, I did. But now, after finishing the main story, I can't see how most of those activities fit into the overall narrative or the character I was playing. The main story doesn't even gel with itself.Cyberpunk 2077 draws heavily from its source material, with everything from the world itself to the life and death of Johnny Silverhand coming from its pen-and-paper inspiration. But unlike in a tabletop RPG, you aren't playing a role of your own creation in Cyberpunk 2077; you're playing V, and this is V's story, not yours. I often felt like I was role-playing two different characters: one V for the side quests and one more limited V for the main story.That's mostly because the main story puts you on a clock. It's not literally on a timer, but it is very urgent in the way that RPG stories often are, and it has the same pitfalls as a result. It feels weird to do throwaway fun stuff when you have a serious, ever-present threat to attend to, and in V's case, it just doesn't make sense to dally.You have more freedom to play the character you really want to during side activities, but main-story V has clearly defined priorities. I often couldn't find the character I'd been developing via side quests when I returned to the main plot--not in how I'd been shaping her personality as she reacted to events, nor in the hacker I built as she was forced into more traditional boss fights.I knew from the outset that I wanted to play as a hacker, so I sped through the character creator, gave my V points in intellect and cool for hacking and stealth, respectively, and started the game. I had picked the Nomad lifepath out of the three total options because it was the only one that positioned V as an outsider to Night City; I figured that I didn't know Night City yet as a newcomer to the game, so why should V?From what I can tell, that lifepath choice didn't affect more than the way the game starts and some dialogue options throughout (and possibly some minor side quests). Now that I've finished the story, I'm much more curious about the Corpo lifepath, in which V used to work at antagonist corporation Arasaka, and how that fits into what I played, but it doesn't feel like a majorly important decision in my experience.The real RPG core is in your five main stats, which are further split into two or three different skill trees, each providing various benefits to combat, stealth, hacking, and so on.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4e84600-2a60-46a8-a87f-0f1606ab9f92": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4e84600-2a60-46a8-a87f-0f1606ab9f92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7423985-9a8e-4574-96d1-7f7c486108a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8082c4d6ef848d5bcbeb44e8e4b279ccb7e33cc09ebca6c34d13f0dec46fe4ee"}, "3": {"node_id": "b4ba4df3-4cbd-4c65-bf3d-719a8b48c569", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "656d424171d1b112b9036b4c1176338a840ec37af811bb35185279e5b1dde744"}}, "hash": "8f207dab5b1d969c8e73b34bb3fa9e9b6196abf4d36de17048e33a05311df8b3", "text": "Using these subskills will passively level them up and give you additional benefits, ensuring you grow according to how you play in addition to how you actively invest points as you level up.The parent skills mainly govern what dialogue options you can use and what kinds of doors you're able to open, at least in the moment-to-moment (they otherwise provide minor stat boosts). Because of this, I tended to invest skills based on my curiosity in conversations or to access areas I wanted to explore. For example, I'd bank points until I found myself in front of a door that required X points in body to force open, and then I'd level up right there and then so I could see what was behind the door. Because the subskills have their own leveling and points system, I found I could freely invest overall skill points without sacrificing my hacking goals--at least when it came to the traditional RPG progression.Hacking into computers and transferring money to your account is one thing; it only requires enough points in the intellect parent skill, just like how body allows you to open certain doors. On the other hand, quickhacking, which allows you to manipulate cameras, turrets, enemies, and more in hostile scenarios, requires a lot of cyberware investment. Specifically, you need a good cyberdeck--which determines how many different quickhacks you can equip--that has enough RAM so you can use ones that demand more memory.Cyberware in general is not cheap. On top of that, an early story mission is gated by a significant sum of money, so I had to do a lot of grinding before I could afford a proper cyberdeck that made my quickhacks truly effective. Until then, I felt like I had to use guns a lot more than I wanted to, which didn't fit with how I initially built my character. I didn't mind the guns overall, though; while it's not on par with dedicated first-person shooters, the gunplay is decent. It's a little clunky, even after tweaking my sensitivity settings, but the aim assist does the heavy lifting.Once I got a good cyberdeck and equipped better quickhacks, combat really picked up for me. I had a quickhack that reset an enemy's optics--pretty much everyone in Night City has cyberware in place of organic eyes--and temporarily blinded them, which allowed me to sneak past. I was able to shut off entire camera systems easily and set turrets to \"friendly mode\" so they wouldn't shoot me on sight. I approached most encounters like a puzzle: I'd hack into the camera systems to see how many enemies I was dealing with, then figure out who to distract and in which direction so I could move from room to room undetected. If that didn't work, I at least knew I could jam their weapons or shock their systems from afar.When I found my rhythm and found the cash, I really enjoyed quickhacking as an alternative approach to combat, and it was always satisfying to get in, steal a bunch of money off some computers, and get out without being spotted.Because I was so focused on this aspect of my character (and saving money to invest in it), I didn't end up spending much time on other approaches; I got the mantis blades, which are cyberware swords that spring out of your arms, so late in the game that I barely used them. Other cyberware upgrades, like a leg modification that gives you a double-jump, were so expensive that I'd have to opt to take on side jobs just to afford them, though this becomes easier later in the game when those gigs have bigger payouts.In fact, most nice things in Night City are prohibitively expensive, and I found that money was often the only obstacle when it came to progression. Granted, I was playing Cyberpunk on a tight deadline, so I couldn't spend much time doing odd jobs. But there is a ridiculous amount of stuff to buy and seemingly endless moneymaking jobs to take on. There's even a whole section in your quest journal dedicated to all the cars people have offered to sell you--though you start the game with a car, and I got multiple free vehicles for completing side quests, so I never bought a car and couldn't find a real reason to.That's emblematic of the world of Cyberpunk 2077. It is so full of things to buy, to do, to see, and yet so much of it doesn't feel essential. Night City is massive, and while you can fast travel from specific points, you'll often need to walk or drive a bit to your destination. I started to compare prices from one ripperdoc to the next--they're how you upgrade your oh-so expensive cyberware--but stopped after the third because I didn't want to drag myself across the city all day.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4ba4df3-4cbd-4c65-bf3d-719a8b48c569": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4ba4df3-4cbd-4c65-bf3d-719a8b48c569", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4e84600-2a60-46a8-a87f-0f1606ab9f92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f207dab5b1d969c8e73b34bb3fa9e9b6196abf4d36de17048e33a05311df8b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "c2c0d88a-034b-49f8-9cca-2642a0dd2775", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8fd6db5c2217a88dbb165385fd63f23a2e8615d27bc3efc97305dcc5a196519"}}, "hash": "656d424171d1b112b9036b4c1176338a840ec37af811bb35185279e5b1dde744", "text": "I went clothing shopping only once for the same reason, and I'd managed to loot more than one cute outfit off of corpses anyway. There's even an entire crafting and item upgrade menu that I never actually needed to use, given that I was regularly looting better gear and items off my numerous enemies; at least in my playthrough, I had no reason to engage with these systems at all.Night City is beautiful and vile. The architecture is often stunning, and some of my favorite sections of the game were when I drove from one district to the next, radio turned up, taking in all the neon lights and monolithic megabuildings piercing the sky. Then I'd get out of the car and hear one of the oft-repeated advertisements blaring out onto the street and quickly snap out of the reverie of driving. There's one ad that's just a man making a long, exaggerated orgasm sound that tended to pierce through any conversation I was having.It's a tough world and a hard one to exist in, by design; with no apparent purpose and context to that experience, all you're left with is the unpleasantness.The ads are one of many, many aesthetic choices in Cyberpunk 2077 that are grating with no real point. There's one ad in particular that was the topic of much discussion pre-release; it features a feminine person with a giant, exaggerated, veiny erection in their leotard and advertises a drink called Chromanticore with the tagline \"mix it up.\" It is everywhere. And while the \"purpose\" of it may be to show what a sex-obsessed, superficial, exploitative place Night City is, there's nothing in the main story or any of the side quests I did that gives it even that much context--I found just one message on one of the many computers I logged into that commented on how low-brow Night City culture is. The result is that there's a fetishization of trans people at every turn, in a game with only one very minor trans character (that I found, at least) and no way to play as an authentically trans character yourself.I found and read tons of text logs, scoured people's private messages, listened to radio and TV programs and random NPC conversations, and I struggled to find justifications for many of Cyberpunk's more questionable and superficial worldbuilding choices. It's a world where megacorporations rule people's lives, where inequality runs rampant, and where violence is a fact of life, but I found very little in the main story, side quests, or environment that explores any of these topics. It's a tough world and a hard one to exist in, by design; with no apparent purpose and context to that experience, all you're left with is the unpleasantness.There are instances where the game does start to do more with an initially superficial choice, but these threads are often dropped quickly. For example, in the pen-and-paper game, the Voodoo Boys were a group of mostly white men who used \"voodoo\" stereotypes to scare people. In 2077, they are a group of Haitian people displaced by natural disaster (by my interpretation, one caused by climate change). At one point in the main story, you can ask a Voodoo Boys member what the name is about, given they don't actually do anything associated with \"voodoo\"; he tells you to ask the people that call them that and refuses to tell you what they call themselves. There's a seed of an interesting idea here--the labels given to the \"other,\" diaspora, the trauma of losing your home--but none of this is ever explored again in the main story as I played it, nor in any of the many side quests I played, either. I didn't find another opportunity to interact with the Voodoo Boys at all.There's so much to cover that I can't possibly touch on everything, but my experience is that there are aspects of the game that feel lost in translation, invoking cultures that aren't adequately explored or contextualized. Characters in one side quest use the word \"ofrenda\" as if it means \"funeral\" when it's actually a particular kind of altar primarily for Day of the Dead--it's unclear to me if this is a translation issue or an overall misunderstanding of Mexican customs, since you do put together an altar during the event that's being called \"the ofrenda.\" As another example, you can go to a clothing store in Japantown and buy \"yukata\" that are just wrap shirts bearing only the slightest resemblance to real yukata.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2c0d88a-034b-49f8-9cca-2642a0dd2775": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2c0d88a-034b-49f8-9cca-2642a0dd2775", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4ba4df3-4cbd-4c65-bf3d-719a8b48c569", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "656d424171d1b112b9036b4c1176338a840ec37af811bb35185279e5b1dde744"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d9514e5-9440-4bd8-9486-6f6ea389efba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b39a73ff4491d655ea77673e3274c5d90715fb8ca714eb29786602627e6b641"}}, "hash": "d8fd6db5c2217a88dbb165385fd63f23a2e8615d27bc3efc97305dcc5a196519", "text": "It's not that Cyberpunk always gets everything wrong in its incorporation of a variety of cultures and backgrounds but that the world is so big and unruly that I never knew what I would find around any corner or if I'd understand what the intent behind it was--I just grew to accept that whatever I did find, at least in terms of setting and worldbuilding, would likely be superficial.That's the case for the world overall and its background characters, anyway. You meet a lot of people in Night City, many of whom die in your wake like you're some sort of curse, while others just call from time to time with a job for you to do. The few that don't die and have proper arcs make up V's friends and love interests, and these are the characters that rightfully stand out.The first is Panam Palmer, who wins the award for the best name in the game. She's a rough-around-the-edges type of girl trying to make her own way in Night City and leaving her Nomad family behind in the process. This was the one instance where I felt my Nomad lifepath actually enhanced the experience--by choosing the Nomad-related responses, I actually felt like I was bonding with Panam over our similar backgrounds. Her quests are often fun, poorly thought-out heists, and by the end, I really did feel like I'd made V a lifelong friend who would drop everything to help her out.My favorite character, though, is Judy Alvarez, an earnest, hot-tempered, beautifully human character with the best arc in the game. She edits braindances, which are kind of like VR movies where you can acutely feel the recorder's emotions (and they're often used for porn). Judy is an incredibly gifted BD editor, and she's also a member of the Moxes, a gang of sex workers that look out for one another. Judy's story unfolds thanks to her fierce and endless desire to fight for her friends, which leads to some of the most interesting quests in the game--and some of the only ones that give you the ability to properly fight back against such a bleak, exploitative world. The final section of Judy's arc was my favorite in the entire game. It's a quiet respite from the lights and sounds of the city, an intimate look into the soul of her character, and provided you meet the requirements, contains the only sex scene I saw that didn't make me want to die on the spot.Romance doesn't play a major role in Cyberpunk, at least in what I saw and played, but you can sleep with sex workers and the occasional random NPC--although I wouldn't recommend it. The sex scenes are all POV-style to fit with the game's first-person perspective, and they are awkward. One was so awful that I actually rolled back my save and told the guy I'd rather be friends instead. He took it like a champ.Legendary rockerboy Johnny Silverhand is with you for the vast majority of the game, showing up in pretty much every mission to try to influence your decisions, make snide remarks, or just kick back on a bed in the background while you talk to someone. His relationship with V is often antagonistic, sometimes playfully so, and other times outright hostile.Johnny is, simply put, an asshole. It's a testament to Keanu Reeves' performance that I actually liked him. He treated his friends badly and women worse. As dialogue options routinely point out, he may or may not qualify as a terrorist; before he died in 2023, he planted a nuke inside Arasaka Tower, an attack against corporate imperialism that ended up killing a lot of people and an important event in the original tabletop game. He's the kind of guy who gets away with far too much, and based on what I learned about him throughout the game, I'm surprised he died at the hands of Adam Smasher rather than by choking on his own vomit after a bender.Johnny is, simply put, an asshole. It's a testament to Keanu Reeves' performance that I actually liked him.Reeves is somehow able to make all of this interesting and kind of charming rather than extremely off-putting. For the most part, Johnny is a well-written character in that I was always curious to hear what he had to say and how he interpreted the situations we were in--I was never quite sure if his advice was any good or if his opinions had any merit, but I wanted to hear him out every time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d9514e5-9440-4bd8-9486-6f6ea389efba": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d9514e5-9440-4bd8-9486-6f6ea389efba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2c0d88a-034b-49f8-9cca-2642a0dd2775", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8fd6db5c2217a88dbb165385fd63f23a2e8615d27bc3efc97305dcc5a196519"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e8f6c66-d1d1-48c8-9948-b7fd173f058a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f5039463cdaf8732350efb52f79f91847df7e7527ab2133e4a67a23c0706ede"}}, "hash": "2b39a73ff4491d655ea77673e3274c5d90715fb8ca714eb29786602627e6b641", "text": "It's Reeves' delivery of these lines, which often involve Johnny chastising you for something or other, that really sells the \"lovable jerk\" vibe that I would normally find overplayed.The push-and-pull of Johnny's opinions and your own adds a lot of color to even run-of-the-mill missions. At one point I didn't heed Johnny's condescending warnings and accepted a deal from a character who ended up tricking me, which also resulted in a lot of people dying (oops); another time, I pursued a side quest only because he practically begged me to do it, saying it was the most interesting thing we'd stumbled upon in a long time (and it did end up being unlike anything else in the game). The dynamic is compelling and left me on my toes, always wondering if I should listen to Johnny or follow my initial instincts.I'm not sure if there were necessarily any completely right or wrong choices in a lot of those missions, but Johnny's presence, and the ambiguity it brings, is supposed to have an effect on V's psyche, for better or for worse--it's a factor of the circumstances that put him in V's head in the first place. That Johnny could affect my decision-making, as well as how I interpreted each interaction, is a clever way to convey that.Aside from character highlights, side quests are far and away the best part of the game. Like the rogue taxi one I mentioned at the beginning of this review, there are quite a few clever, interesting, goofy, and sad side quests that I really enjoyed. On a gameplay level, they often provide a nice change of pace from the more combat-focused main story; sometimes you just talk to people, while a more involved one has you doing favors for Johnny since he's, you know, technically dead.One especially intriguing side quest had me playing detective, investigating a mysterious break-in at the apartment of a Night City mayoral candidate. Mechanically, it's a simple open-world \"use your ability to highlight clues\" gimmick, but what follows is a fascinating and kind of creepy look at Night City corruption, gaslighting, and whether it's better to tell someone the truth if it means it could get them killed. Conversely, I also did a really silly quest that involved a clown man with a grenade for a nose that had no point but was delightful in a weird way.Side quests amounted to around 30 hours of my total playtime, and they were what propelled me through. While not every one lands, there are some that feel essential in a way that very little else in the game does. These include Judy's story arc and the taxi excursion as well as a much shorter story about a depressed man who lives in V's apartment building. Even on the tight review deadline, I kept finding myself seeking out just one more side quest before bed just because I was eager to see what I would find.All that said, when I finished the game, I felt empty. All the friends I had made, what I learned about Johnny, the way I developed my V as a character--much of it didn't seem to matter. Making friends in a lonely, sad city doesn't affect the urgency of V's main quest, and it doesn't seem to affect her priorities related to it. Discovering a police-sponsored murder coverup or the depths of corporate control of Night City life doesn't seem to change V's ambitions to be remembered as a legendary Night City merc. Falling in love didn't even give my V what she wanted.I got a lot out of the side quests and some of the characters, but I got very little out of the overall story.I don't quite understand the ending I got, but it made me sad. It didn't reflect the V I felt I'd developed, one who helped her friends and followed her curiosity. Worst of all, I have no idea what Cyberpunk 2077 is even trying to say. There's an overall theme of identity that is dashed by the dissonance between the V you actually play and the V you get in the end; otherwise, I couldn't tell you what Cyberpunk is trying to do with its beautifully grotesque world. I got a lot out of the side quests and some of the characters, but I got very little out of the overall story.It also bears a mention: Cyberpunk 2077 is phenomenally buggy. I played a pre-release build that was updated during the review period, and there's a day-one patch planned as well, but the scale of technical issues is too large to reasonably expect immediate fixes. I encountered some kind of bug on every mission I went on, from more common, funnier ones like characters randomly T-posing to several complete crashes.

In a very late-game, very important fight, the game froze on me--twice. I ended up taking a break out of frustration before attempting, and finally succeeding, the third time.These bugs, more than any game I've played in years, took me out of the experience often. Non-interactable items like cardboard boxes will explode when you interact with something next to them; UI elements will stay on-screen long after they're meant to, which is only solved by reloading a save; characters will interrupt themselves during proper dialogue sequences by repeating a throwaway line they'd say in the overworld, seriously disrupting key moments; I died once and, upon reloading my last save, found my hacking ability no longer worked, forcing me to roll back to an autosave 10 minutes prior. The list is extensive.The technical problems not only took me out of the game literally but also led me to question whether certain things throughout the game were intentional. It often took me a moment or two to determine whether a visual glitch was supposed to be happening due to V's cyberware, which is a major part of the story, or if I needed to reload the game. There were a few instances where I couldn't tell if dialogue or an event had been skipped due to a bug or by design, since there are times where the game will skip you ahead in time as part of a scene. I also found some exploration sequences frustrating because it was incredibly hard to tell if I was just missing the clue I was supposed to find or if it hadn't popped up at all, and I ended up leaving areas and coming back later on multiple occasions out of confusion and frustration. At least once, I didn't get a dialogue hint indicating what to do until I left the area and came back.I was playing on a gaming laptop well above the minimum specs announced for Cyberpunk 2077, while another GameSpot player experienced the same severity and frequency of bugs (though no hard crashes) on an even higher-end desktop PC. Your mileage may vary, but in our experience, the bugs are obtrusive and substantial across the board, often forcing us to reload saves or exit the game entirely. It's hard to get really into a world you constantly have to leave.But then it's hard to get into Cyberpunk 2077's world in general. So much of it is superficial set dressing, and there's so much happening all around you--ads going off at all times, gunfights breaking out in the streets, texts coming in about cars you'll never buy--that a lot of the game feels superfluous. The side quests and the characters they showcase are the shining beacon through the neon-soaked bleakness of Night City, and they give you room to explore the best the core RPG mechanics have to offer. These are what carried me through an otherwise disappointing experience.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nKotaku, It\u2019s been two weeks since Cyberpunk 2077 officially released. In my initial impressions, I wrote that I was ready for everyone\u2014developer CD Projekt Red, the studio\u2019s PR people, fans\u2014to stop talking about the game and just let me play it. I\u2019ve been playing steadily since before launch, but weeks later, it feels like there\u2019s barely room in the conversation to talk about the game itself.Of course, talking about what\u2019s inside Cyberpunk is hard if you can\u2019t stomach its content, can\u2019t play it for your physical health, or can\u2019t make it work on your console. After a long cycle of pre-release hype, social media missteps, and crunch, Cyberpunk freefell out of the gate by giving one journalist a seizure. Its post-release life has been about the game\u2019s poor performance on consoles, so rife with bugs and crashes that CDPR offered refunds. This declaration basically amounted to the studio simply saying players could refund it, leading to console-makers and retail stores taking matters into their own hands. In addition to offering refunds, Sony took the extreme step of removing the game from the PlayStation store altogether. Many people who could actually run the game were disappointed by its lack of promised features and how little it resembled what CDPR had spent years promoting. Meetings between CDPR management and investors and management and staff suggest a mishandled project, a host of unrealistic expectations, and something between willful ignorance and intentional deception to hide the game\u2019s abysmal state.Meanwhile, the conversation about the game went just as disastrously as the game\u2019s launch.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8427867f-9e7f-4002-9960-483766554af1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8427867f-9e7f-4002-9960-483766554af1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e8f6c66-d1d1-48c8-9948-b7fd173f058a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f5039463cdaf8732350efb52f79f91847df7e7527ab2133e4a67a23c0706ede"}, "3": {"node_id": "29339bbe-0997-4d53-8b5c-4431d00b8fcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "00e4988f4aceeb657f419a5affe6a56307813008fe99ebe52492775b0384423b"}}, "hash": "a3caaa14f536e9a89377727e67d2ab90df14337fdfc06b59940a50f33d652e52", "text": "Some fans bombarded reviewers with hate and harassment for giving the game low scores or for pointing out it gave them a seizure, then changed their tune post-release to bombard reviewers with hate and harassment for scoring it too high. Some fans, and even critics, felt the press were complicit with CDPR in hiding the game\u2019s poor performance. (From what I could see, the hiding was very much done by the publisher. CDPR only offered the better-performing PC version for review, and restricted when reviewers could show their own video; while the lack of console code certainly made us at Kotaku wonder what was up, no reviewer that I know of had any special insight into the console version, nor did CDPR seem to impose any restrictions that would prevent a reviewer from giving their honest assessment of the game or talking about its bugs.)Despite all of this, I kept playing Cyberpunk after I published my impressions. I\u2019ve got over 60 hours in it now; I keep drifting back to it, alongside those players still doggedly posting gameplay memes on Reddit and all those hardworking guides and tips writers trying to treat Cyberpunk like any other video game. I\u2019ve got a long list of stories I\u2019d like to write about it: neat sidequests I\u2019ve done, interesting things that have happened to me, thoughts on how the game thinks about issues I care about, such as the environment and food. But it\u2019s always felt tone deaf to talk about Cyberpunk with so much controversy swirling around it, and with so many players unable to play it at all. Every time I think \u201cI\u2019d like to write about Cyberpunk today,\u201d the monkey\u2019s paw curls into some new, terrible contortion.(This review contains mild spoilers for how Cyberpunk\u2019s ending works.)Here\u2019s a pretty telling snapshot of what playing Cyberpunk has been like for me. Last weekend, I did a sidequest about autonomous cars. I made my way through a malfunctioning (purposefully, as intended by the game code) autonomous car factory. I hacked into computers to read emails about the company\u2019s human workers losing their jobs, enjoying the rich worldbuilding Cyberpunk largely consigns to its margins. I short-circuited enemy robots with my cyberware hacks, a repetitive but satisfying way around obstacles. As I progressed, it became apparent that I would have a choice to make at the end of this quest, one made complicated by what I\u2019d learned about the cars during an earlier storyline. It was a well-written quest with an interesting choice at its core, and I was both eager and anxious to get to its end. But I had another obstacle to navigate besides the enemy drones and my own conscience: The doors on one side of the factory were glitched (unintentionally, a problem with the game code), and instead of leading to hallways they led to the gaping chasm of the underside of the map. I couldn\u2019t pass through them without falling to my death. I was able to work around it until the end of the quest, when I found myself one attribute point shy of being able to select the choice I wanted to. I considered leaving the area, leveling up, and coming back, but the unintentionally broken doors made me doubt I could. I picked a less savory choice. Keanu Reeves called me \u201ca real piece of shit.\u201d I got a vehicle for my trouble, drove it politely out of the factory, and have yet to drive it again because of how badly it handles. I read a guide that says the different outcomes aren\u2019t all that different anyway.On my PC, beefed up specifically for the game, Cyberpunk performs OK. I can work around the technical failings and laugh at or even admire the bugs. It\u2019s only crashed once, hilariously, when another car hit me so hard the whole game mysteriously shut down. So I\u2019m not playing the broken mess we\u2019re all talking about. Instead, I\u2019m playing a game whose various pieces don\u2019t fit together, where busyness and choices feel like illusions to cover up its emptiness, where key features like driving and gunplay are a chore. I leave each play session a little befuddled and dissatisfied, but then I read about a quest or see a video of an unfamiliar area and boot the game up again. I can\u2019t quite say if I like it, even though saying things like that is part of my job. I\u2019m still playing it, but I\u2019m not always sure why.In my impressions, I reviewed each piece of the game separately, evaluating its plot, gameplay, systems, and world on their own.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29339bbe-0997-4d53-8b5c-4431d00b8fcb": {"__data__": {"id_": "29339bbe-0997-4d53-8b5c-4431d00b8fcb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "8427867f-9e7f-4002-9960-483766554af1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3caaa14f536e9a89377727e67d2ab90df14337fdfc06b59940a50f33d652e52"}, "3": {"node_id": "697ab48a-52f2-49d0-b0a3-4d8735a4b43f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d315327683a73763a1fb56136c95ef978f5ab9b390250ae824a39b6eee1c0cf"}}, "hash": "00e4988f4aceeb657f419a5affe6a56307813008fe99ebe52492775b0384423b", "text": "After getting through the main plot and several of the game\u2019s possible endings, Cyberpunk still feels like a bunch of separate pieces that, as one of my colleagues framed it, feel held together through sheer force of will. Some pieces shine: Night City might be mostly a facade of vanishing non-player-characters, empty storefronts, and senseless traffic patterns, but it\u2019s thoughtfully crafted and enticing to explore. Much of my time in the game has been spent just driving for miles, admiring how naturally a busy commercial hub becomes an imposing corporate center becomes a run-down residential neighborhood becomes abandoned outskirts. I can\u2019t get enough of the TV shows, books, and ads; I recently spent 10 minutes watching a talk show on a television in a random food stall, where a therapist and the blue-haired host argued about the causes of cyberpsychosis. A sidequest contained a snippet of fan fiction about Johnny Silverhand\u2019s band Samurai that I actually squealed in delight over. All the background information paints a richer, more intentional world than you encounter just by playing the game. While this bothered me when I first started playing, I love it now. It feels like secrets stashed away for me to find, the detailed world the game\u2019s marketing promised showing up only when I make the time to look.\u201cIn Night City you can become anyone, as long as you don\u2019t mind not wearing pants.\u201dRPG--no, action adventure game--no, cyberpunk metaphorExploring Night City, excellent lore and world-building, some interesting charactersUninteresting combat, lack of meaningful choices, poor handling of topics like gender, sex, and raceCD Projekt RedPC (played), PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox X/S, StadiaDecember 10, 202064 hours by the in-game counter; played through two of the possible endings and two of the epiloguesI also, despite myself, grew to love Keanu Reeves as Johnny. The plot\u2019s \u201cpoint of no return\u201d\u2014the moment at which you\u2019re shuttled to the end\u2014came sooner than I expected, after a bunch of main story quests that were exciting but never deep enough to really grab me. Your ending options change based on relationships you forge and choices you make, leading to a few branching scenarios and epilogues, after which you\u2019re dropped back into the game right before the final mission, which you can replay if you want. The whole game is technically about what to do about sharing your brain with the digital ghost of Johnny, but I only started appreciating him after the epilogues I saw changed our relationship. In the post-game, where he\u2019s no longer a narrative ticking clock, I\u2019ve come to enjoy his company. I like when he shows up physically, unlike the host of other characters who never stop calling me on the phone. His hamfisted anti-corporate talk and dreaming of his glory days as a rebel rocker felt pretentious for a long time, but now I just think fondly, \u201cWhatever, old man.\u201d He\u2019s more sad than he is cool, but what we\u2019ve gone through together gives him depth. I\u2019ve gotten a few items related to him through sidequests, and I keep wearing them even though I\u2019ve found better gear. I can even bring myself to sometimes drive his car.Other parts of Cyberpunk work on their own but not within the game. Now that I\u2019m through the plot, the upgrades and perks that once intimidated me feel like the systems of a much longer game, one that would require you to prepare for a dramatic final showdown or give you bigger late-game challenges. I\u2019ve maxed out my street cred, but I don\u2019t need the better weapons the stat unlocks. The high-level guns I have do a lot of damage, but I don\u2019t think upgrading them further will make fights less basic or less time- and bullet-consuming. The perks at the far ends of the skill trees sound cool, but I\u2019m pursuing them more out of curiosity than a real sense of need. There\u2019s no reason to put points into stats that give me different quest options if most of the quests end up the same. My expensive double-jumping cyberlegs haven\u2019t unlocked any worthwhile new areas. The weapons, character enhancements, and leveling system are all good on their own, but they feel like they would be better used in a game with a longer story, more nuanced combat, or a different difficulty curve.Other parts of the game just don\u2019t work at all.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "697ab48a-52f2-49d0-b0a3-4d8735a4b43f": {"__data__": {"id_": "697ab48a-52f2-49d0-b0a3-4d8735a4b43f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "29339bbe-0997-4d53-8b5c-4431d00b8fcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "00e4988f4aceeb657f419a5affe6a56307813008fe99ebe52492775b0384423b"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc8f7e88-3d76-48c3-9fc8-19b207568af7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b05a67b2638fbb708b05d1b015de0fe4387ff01ee8db832270d52fe2d7950176"}}, "hash": "6d315327683a73763a1fb56136c95ef978f5ab9b390250ae824a39b6eee1c0cf", "text": "Cyberpunk never departs from its crass sexualization or un-nuanced views of race; as cool as its world can be, it\u2019s always a little off-putting. For all protagonist V is meant to be a criminal trying to make his way in Night City, he can side with corporations and cops as easily as gangs and fixers, making whatever anti-establishment sentiments the game professes to explore feel hollow. The complex character creator is mostly for show. My nomad background never came into play in a meaningful way. Even the different endings seem less like naturally-occurring results and more like hitting the right boxes on a checklist. There are several boss battles that I found tedious, against characters I didn\u2019t care about whose only interesting moves were that they could heal themselves. I\u2019ve mostly just crafted ammo, since the game\u2019s enemies require so much of it. None of the rest of the crafting has felt necessary; it also seems like, until recently, too much crafting could break your saves.I don\u2019t know the story of Cyberpunk\u2019s development, but when I play I catch hints of what feels like frustrated intentions everywhere. There are so many places where the game feels like it was meant to be something else: areas meant to have content, choices that could have mattered, features that could have been more necessary. Besides not meeting my hopes of how it could have been great, the game also doesn\u2019t diverge from my fears about how it\u2019d fall short. Its worst parts are exactly what some of its pre-release talking points suggested they\u2019d be: regressive about race and gender despite so many opportunities to correct course, a cyberpunk veneer that\u2019s made its most substantial point in how the game itself demonstrates how corporations like the one that made it behave. It\u2019s hard to play this game without constantly wondering: Why is it like this? What happened during these past eight years?I assume CDPR will keep releasing patches to fix some of the game\u2019s problems, making Cyberpunk run on last-gen consoles and letting more players actually play. I don\u2019t know whether the developers will fix its other problems, overhauling the combat, customization, AI, driving, wanted system, and all the other parts many players are disappointed in.I\u2019m torn. I want to play the game that it seems like the hundreds of people who worked so hard on it intended to make. I want them to turn Cyberpunk\u2019s disastrous launch into something they can be proud of. But I\u2019d also feel OK if the studio\u2019s management learned some lessons from the whole thing, gave the developers a well-deserved break, and tried to do better with a new project. I don\u2019t know if the conversation around the game will be some kind of breaking point, or just the latest triple-A game controversy we all yell about until another one shows up.My favorite ending in Cyberpunk is the one a lot of players call the \u201cbad\u201d ending. I wouldn\u2019t have been satisfied if it were my only choice, but its sad but uncompromising tone felt right for my playthrough. In every ending, characters you forged relationships with message you during the credits. In this ending, they have different opinions on your choice, and some wish things came out differently. This ending felt most like my time inside Cyberpunk and in the discussion around it: a lot of conflicting emotions and no definitive answer.\u00a0\nGiant Bomb, B\u00f6rk B\u00f6rk B\u00f6rk! Let\u2019s meke-a pancakes.\nGame Revolution, \nBy\n\nPaul Tamburro \nCyberpunk 2077 review for PC.\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0is not what CD Projekt Red wanted it to be. Never before has a game so clearly defined the over-ambitiousness of the gaming industry, with it so laboriously stuffed with content that it\u2019s quite literally bursting at the seams. Everywhere you look in Night City there\u2019s evidence of a project gone awry, from the mountain of glitches and performance issues, through to poorly implemented features like crafting and leveling. It is a game where you can read a log entry about a company working its staff to the bone for little reward, then hop onto a motorcycle that causes your player-character, V, to T-pose with their pants off.Cyberpunk 2077 has been\u00a0released, but it\u2019s not yet ready to be played. Even on PC, which is the version of the game being reviewed here and is superior to the disastrous PS4 and Xbox One versions in every way, it\u2019s clear that it is unfinished.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc8f7e88-3d76-48c3-9fc8-19b207568af7": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc8f7e88-3d76-48c3-9fc8-19b207568af7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "697ab48a-52f2-49d0-b0a3-4d8735a4b43f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d315327683a73763a1fb56136c95ef978f5ab9b390250ae824a39b6eee1c0cf"}, "3": {"node_id": "174820b7-ab2e-4710-be4b-3a668a3ac91a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "164517ec1b0bbc7c50c91ad73651605ef53de560141ea1dd858e9b34e9828fe0"}}, "hash": "b05a67b2638fbb708b05d1b015de0fe4387ff01ee8db832270d52fe2d7950176", "text": "My first steps in Night City were not spent admiring its towering skyscrapers or bustling streets, but rather excessively tinkering with the settings to get it to run adequately.Even after working to achieve serviceable performance on an RTX 2070 Super, various inexplicable issues would routinely arise to remind me of its troubled development. My health meter would suddenly stop working, the mini-map would send me in the wrong direction, or an important boss fight would be brought to a halt by said boss becoming stuck in thin air. While I never experienced a hard crash or game-breaking bugs during my playtime and all of the more egregious bugs resolved themselves in time, it was impossible to be feel immersed in its world when so much was breaking around me.Rarely has a game been so at odds with its setting as\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077 is with its story of rebellion in a capitalist dystopia. With the context of CD Projekt Red\u2019s widely-reported crunching practices, its anti-corporate message feels inauthentic. It is as punk as John Lydon doing a butter commercial. Though we\u2019re often asked to \u201cseparate art from the artist,\u201d it is difficult to believe in\u00a0Cyberpunk\u2018s message when it is so at odds with what\u2019s been reported about its development cycle.This inauthenticity stretches to the customization options offered to you, which struggle to let you become one of Night City\u2019s enhancement-obsessed populace. You\u2019re locked into one of just two body types and gender options from the outset, a smattering of cosmetic-only cybernetic enhancements, and appearance choices that won\u2019t make your V look too different from everyone else\u2019s. Considering that the game\u2019s marketing informs would-be players that \u2018Night City Changes Every Body,\u2019 you can\u2019t even get a haircut. Aside from your clothing, your V will look the same at the start of the game as they do at the end, but you can choose between two penises so at least there\u2019s that.You\u2019re asked to choose a Lifepath, a seemingly major choice that I figured would have a big impact on the rest of the game. Out of Nomad, Streetkid, and Corpo, I opted for the latter, assuming that being directly involved in Night City\u2019s seedy corporations would allow me to experience a riches-to-rags story and see both sides of the coin. Instead, a brief prologue led to a montage summarizing six months of important story detail, as my Corpo background became nothing more than the occasional ineffectual dialog option.So much of\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0feels like the beginnings of a great idea left by the wayside to meet an arbitrary deadline. Its leveling system is intricately detailed, allowing you to increase individual core stats like Body, Reflexes, and Cool, and then dive in deeper with perk points that let you tweak V as you see fit. However, points are handed out sparingly, and the stats mostly feel inconsequential given that they only add marginal improvements to your character. Crafting is also a glaring oversight, with you able to upgrade each gun, equip fun mods, or even make new weapons from scratch, but then it\u2019s in no way vital outside of occasionally needing to craft ammo.Considering the lengthy period of time between its announcement and release, the whole experience bleeds disappointment. This is made even more frustrating by the multiple signs that a great game is to be found in the wreckage. Not just a great game, in fact, but a terrific one\u00a0\u2014 when the stars align and\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0works as intended, there\u2019s nothing else quite like it, and it\u2019s all thanks to Night City.Night City isn\u2019t your typical sprawling-yet-barren game world where you do little more than travel between objectives \u2014 there are always secrets to unearth if you take the time to stop and smell the oil-covered roses. Taking a seat at a diner could result in you being caught up in an impromptu robbery, while going for a stroll beneath the freeway can end up in a guided meditation session with a mysterious Buddhist. Night City is so much more than just nice scenery you can stop to stare at between waypoints, and my curiosity was always rewarded.When at its best,\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0had me naturally finding myself at the center of unexpected chaos. In one brief period of time, I\u00a0was tasked with trying to calm an uneasy AI taxi cab that had gone rogue, before I stumbled upon a mini-boss fight with a crazed construction worker who had been fitted into a giant exosuit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "174820b7-ab2e-4710-be4b-3a668a3ac91a": {"__data__": {"id_": "174820b7-ab2e-4710-be4b-3a668a3ac91a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc8f7e88-3d76-48c3-9fc8-19b207568af7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b05a67b2638fbb708b05d1b015de0fe4387ff01ee8db832270d52fe2d7950176"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f17e998-d27f-43b2-9f92-eccd0f4a1a7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cbfdda031db9326185d4574327a1b0a055c85026df50cba75650df433c86e796"}}, "hash": "164517ec1b0bbc7c50c91ad73651605ef53de560141ea1dd858e9b34e9828fe0", "text": "Then I traveled north, to nowhere in particular, and found the mountains of imposing oil rigs that fuel the beautiful, dangerous city V lives in. It is these moments that make Night City feel alive.However, despite building the most impressive open-world I\u2019ve yet seen in a game, I was inexplicably encouraged to rush through Cyberpunk 2077\u2018s\u00a0main story arc and overlook it all. By introducing a plot device that essentially makes V a ticking time bomb, I felt compelled to push through my main jobs and leave my side jobs behind. This is unfortunate, as while the main story is what drives the plot forward, the side jobs are what reveal the beating heart at the center of Night City.Side jobs will mostly see you working with characters you\u2019re hurriedly introduced to in the main story. Not only do they help to give much-needed context to the overarching plot, but they also provide interesting stories in their own right. It\u2019s reminiscent of\u00a0Fallout: New Vegas, albeit with less player choice, where you take a detour from the main quest to embark on a winding adventure filled with surprises and colorful characters.The voice acting is almost universally excellent. V, portrayed by\u00a0Cherami Leigh or\u00a0Gavin Drea depending on whether you\u2019ve opted for a female or male player-character, is the right mix of sympathetic and intimidating, keeping me locked in tight to the story even when the dialogue leaned a little too heavily into sci-fi convolution. Keanu Reeves, who surprisingly features heavily in the game, gets the worst deal when it comes to this. His character, the narcissistic rocker-turned-terrorist Johnny Silverhand, is forced to say more than a few lines that made me think of Harrison Ford\u2019s comments on the\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0script: \u201cYou can type this shit, but you can\u2019t say it.\u201dWhile Reeves\u2019 performance can be hit-and-miss\u00a0\u2014 the Hollywood actor isn\u2019t exactly known for his impressive range and it shows here\u00a0\u2014 the rest of the cast help make Night City\u2019s interweaving stories memorable. These side jobs also provide the player with the most choice, allowing you to make crucial decisions that are rarely presented to you in the main story.This is why the sense of urgency imparted on the player is so baffling.\u00a0It\u2019s fitting that\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0is based on Mike Pondsmith\u2019s tabletop role-playing game of the same name, as it often felt like I was locked in a session with an impatient DM. Amid an ongoing information dump of names, locations, and objectives in Cyberpunk\u2018s prologue, I was hurriedly whisked through parts of the game I\u2019d later learn were integral to my enjoyment of it.The most egregious example of this is cyberware. This is hastily revealed at the start of the game before becoming just another marker on the obscenely overstuffed map, yet unlocking new cybernetics to attach to V significantly improves its gunplay. Not only that, but the most fun cybernetics cost huge sums of money that can\u2019t be obtained in any timely fashion. As gunfighting can be a chore, with weapons feeling clunky to handle while enemy AI is inconsistent, cyberware can dramatically increase the player\u2019s enjoyment of it. So\u00a0why is it so difficult to get?And that feels like\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0in a nutshell\u00a0\u2014 a truly excellent game hidden beneath layers of poor choices. There\u2019s so much here to love, yet between the copious bugs, performance issues, and it ushering the player away from its very best features, it gets lost in the rubble.When played on PC,\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0is still an impressive, engrossing, and fun RPG despite its flaws. However, assuming that CD Projekt Red sticks to its word and fixes its problems, it has all the potential to be a genuine classic of its genre. As such, it\u2019s difficult to recommend playing it at its worst, when its best could be something special.Cyberpunk 2077 reviewed on PC.

Nothing has changed since then.Without giving away too much, your avatar (named \u201cV\u201d) busts into Night City and tries to make a name for themselves as a hustler and odd-job-taker. Very quickly (I\u2019m talking a few hours in) you get wrapped up in a socio-economic plotline involving some of the biggest names in the city, and become mentally entwined with Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) via technical wizardry. Johnny is pretty much present for the entire shebang as a Great Gazoo figure (he does basically call you \u201cdumb dumb\u201d a lot!), and for the most part, appears randomly and taunts you: eventually you start to learn more about his story and forge your own.It\u2026works until it doesn\u2019t. Again, a lot of the meat of Cyberpunk\u00a0is found in the cracks between the main questline. Many supporting characters have a compelling story to tell; you just need to coax it out of them through optional missions, because the critical path really isn\u2019t going to deliver on that front. In some sections it feels cobbled together and rushed, quickly dispensing lore dumps and then whisking you out of a fixed location.Some campaign quests have this really obvious \u201cmassive cut\u201d that amounts to a short load screen when you\u2019re just at the apex of something exciting. Either it\u2019ll knock you out with an errant blow to the head, or you\u2019ll get a jarring load screen that will transport you to an entirely different location. It\u2019s all meant to be stylized, but in some instances, it feels like the team just wasn\u2019t sure how to end a sequence.The sidequests on the other hand aren\u2019t afraid to get weirder. In fact, I spent a lot of time embarking upon these oddities thinking \u201cwhy weren\u2019t these just campaign missions?\u201d Some of the most meaningful dialogue, character growth, and interpersonal relationships are buried within these quests that a lot of people will never see (which is why I\u2019m glad I took my time with this review). It\u2019s almost like these portions of the game were designed by a different team; or hungrier, more junior developers. That lack of polish also applies to the RPG elements; which might be one of the most disappointing pieces of the package given that this is based on a tabletop RPG.Loot and inventory management can be a mess, often resulting in chasing menial stat-boosts that barely impact gameplay in any meaningful fashion. Crafting similarly feels like a complete afterthought, as do many of the \u201cplus stat\u201d skill-up perks that you\u2019ll apply between leveling. Depending on your build you\u2019ll either gain completely new abilities, or a few stat points here and there. At first glance Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0seems to have expansive skill tree and crafting systems, but they\u2019re only skin deep.The main strength of Cyberpunk 2077\u00a0is the joy found in stomping around the open world. It can feel sterile at times (particularly with some gaunt and lifeless NPCs), but when something randomly pops up (like a new building, sidequest, or open world event), it\u2019s fun to just hang out. That counts for a whole lot in a game like this, and was one of the best parts of Witcher III. In fact, it saved the game for me from descending into \u201cokay\u201d territory. On PC, when the game isn\u2019t bugging out, Night City can look beautiful and imposing. I\u2019m still going to be aimlessly trekking through it for the foreseeable future.So at the time of the review-in-progress last week I didn\u2019t have any major bugs to report; but lo and behold I came across some, even with the day-one patch. Most\u00a0of what I experienced are minor visual and AI issues, including cases like this one right here: where the vehicle on the right flipped out and whirlwinded around like the Tasmanian Devil.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9319ee9-46b6-42e1-9ec7-b647bf3c5a6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9319ee9-46b6-42e1-9ec7-b647bf3c5a6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c9a6cf-83c5-4ad2-9d7c-808f8212287c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37589c25fc98c46fe81d15b0686b546f729c168bc0a80b7dec6cf95370a2a8c2"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f17e998-d27f-43b2-9f92-eccd0f4a1a7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cbfdda031db9326185d4574327a1b0a055c85026df50cba75650df433c86e796"}}, "hash": "e9a8aa5a23bca1ab48eb58e1c27da7c7121868cb34fc785bfa22a4b6cbcc5cb6", "text": "But there\u2019s stuff that\u2019s more severe than that. Another bug killed me after opening up an elevator shaft door (I assume the physics system sprang it into my body at 1000x the force required and did enough damage to take me out), resulting in 10 minutes of lost progress during a relatively low-key walking sequence.In one instance, loading a save didn\u2019t spawn the enemies required to actually finish a mission: putting me in an endless loop. In true Ubisoft fashion, I was saved by the constant auto-save system, which brought me back to an earlier checkpoint. Oh, I also crashed out twice and lost around 10 minutes of progress each time. Note that you cannot save in combat, nor can you save during an in-game cutscene: so if you feel a crash coming, sometimes you can\u2019t do anything about it. At most, I lost around 45 minutes of progress that I can live with, and dealt with some easily-bested glitched AI and a few wonky visual effects. It\u2019s not the end of the world, but the lack of polish is so obvious, even on PC (which is arguably the most stable platform of them all).Cyberpunk 2077 is a victim of bloat, but you can choose to ignore a lot of it and take in the sights. That\u2019s where Night City is at its best, and I sincerely suggest that you take your time going through it, as rushing will only lead to disappointment. Even just strolling through though, you\u2019ll probably be left wanting more.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience.
