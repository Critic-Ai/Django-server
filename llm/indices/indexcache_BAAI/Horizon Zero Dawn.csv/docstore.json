For developer Guerrilla Games, at least, Horizon Zero Dawn sees a remarkable change in both pace and tone, a well-earned break from over ten years of stoic service on the gritty battlefields of Killzone and a step away from the crushed concrete and exposed steel mesh of Helghan towards something brighter, breezier, more open. Horizon Zero Dawn is a sumptuous, slow-burning adventure that stretches its 30 hour tale across a vast and beautiful map that's light years away from the killing fields of Guerrilla's first-person shooter series. It's an open world game of admirable scope and craft. And yet there's something wearisomely familiar about it all. Perhaps that's down to this being Guerrilla's first big open world, the studio lacking some of the confidence to forge its own path, for you'll have seen much of Horizon Zero Dawn elsewhere. This is a genre piece that's a little too generic: Horizon Zero Dawn is too liberal with what it borrows, and often too literal to boot. The result ends up feeling like an imitation of something you'll have played countless times before, and often in finer form.The fiction is all Horizon Zero Dawn's own, however, an enjoyably pulpy new age sci-fi where the earth lies in ruins and is patrolled by savage hordes of mechanical dinosaurs. You're Aloy, a tribal outcast who's promoted against the odds in this post-apocalyptic matriarchy to the role of seeker, venturing past the boundaries of her isolated village. There's enough enigma in the world that lies beyond to pull you through the course of the tale, even if some of its threads get knotted up along the way. It doesn't help that Horizon Zero Dawn so readily invites comparison to The Witcher 3. It's a match-up that was always going to weigh against Guerrilla's favour; this doesn't benefit from all that world-building that's gone before in CD Projekt's dark adult folklore, and in its place is a sci-fi fantasy that tends towards over-earnestness. It's a young adult The Witcher 3, but lacking so much of the warmth or the charm. The grand structure of Horizon Zero Dawn apes The Witcher 3 - it's a series of quests that guide you through the various sights and sounds of this ruined earth, complete with countless diversions along the way - as are some of the finer details. Come across a scene and you'll be asked to investigate using your 'focus' - an overlay enabled by a magical bluetooth headset you find early on in the game, one of the lumpier parts of the fiction here - tracking footsteps and investigating items. There's not that same sense of purpose, though, the all-important motivation and character getting lost in uneven writing and mumbled execution. Blame some of that on Decima, Guerrilla's own engine that does a remarkable job of rendering fantastical steel, sparks of neon and achingly beautiful landscapes yet stumbles on the more personal drama it's been asked to convey. Ashly Burch brings a humanity to the role of Aloy that's undermined by the awkward performance capture and twitchy editing of each cutscene. It's telling that so much of the heavy lifting and exposition here is done via scratchy hologram playback or through the many audio diaries that act as collectibles along the way. A small shame that Horizon Zero Dawn can be so dreary when so much of it is delightful. As a visual spectacle it's unsurpassed, on console at least; here's one area in which Guerrilla can go toe-to-toe with The Witcher 3 with more than a fighting chance. The landscape itself is varied and rich, swooping from tundra to woodland to the grandest of canyons as fast as one of the mechanical mounts can take you, while the detail is staggering; tall grass sways to a gentle breeze as swarms of fireflies dance above the thickets. There's something deliciously, irrefutably and proudly video gamey about its aesthetic, an impossible clash of tribal lore and far future tech that somehow all makes sense. As a technical achievement, Horizon Zero Dawn is nothing short of a masterpiece.What you do out in those wildlands also benefits from some impeccable craft, even if it's often short on imagination. The combat in Horizon Zero Dawn is enjoyably meaty, bringing all the intensity and complexity of a first-person shooter to the open world genre. Aloy's main tool is a bow - reinforcing the idea that there's more than a little Katniss about her - and it's complemented by a suite of ingenious tools.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ee22a92-13df-451d-bb70-1d1f6940e7bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ee22a92-13df-451d-bb70-1d1f6940e7bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "3870b144-b46f-432c-9b02-776f1c42b720", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb331fedfba5bd419f5acd3b6ee1a90649b07d9ca6140a6e4610bd0ab1d2f2fa"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7b2da4b-e7a1-4b00-af6c-c0da47653492", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "39d3a3e9e68fcc2f5e3d8364794e8f8d792c4500d60d115c92dd5498b82719b3"}}, "hash": "538bb911e08d85014f05d7f63fb62d1a9ffe3f496920188914d6b0153bd28ce6", "text": "There are trip wires, traps and - best of all - a ropecaster that can be used to tie down prey. The toolbox is a treat, and it's put to good use. There's more than a trace of Far Cry in its pomp as you lean on light stealth mechanics to clear out bandit camps, even if the AI's not quite robust enough to deliver the same sort of surprises that Ubisoft's own series often conjures. Horizon Zero Dawn finds its own voice, however, when you're facing down the dinosaurs that roam its wildlands. The mechanical menagerie are very much the stars of the show.They're brilliantly designed, Tomy's Zoids toyline of the 80s given oh-so-fashionable orange and teal makeovers and complete with beautifully evocative names such as Thunderjaw and Sawtooth. They've more personality than the rest of the cast combined, and the encounters with them that form the backbone of Horizon Zero Dawn see the game firing on all cylinders. It's here where Aloy's moveset is pushed to the fore, and she's a more than able star; there's the poise of Lara, with a little of Vanquish's flair folded in too as you slide from encounter to encounter, crafting new ammo as you go. When it all comes together, Horizon Zero Dawn can be electric. It's disappointing, then, that too much time is spent in cookie cutter encounters with more mundane flesh and bone of fellow tribespeople, where the imagination falters and where it all feels most like a pale imitation of countless games that have come before. There's the foundation here for something truly wonderful to come, and you hope that Horizon Zero Dawn does enough for Guerrilla to be able to come back and have another crack - and to perhaps put more of its own stamp on it all if it does. This is far, far from a bad game - it's enjoyable in its own way, and you're certainly never short of things to do. There are zip-lines to chase down, towers to climb, dialogue trees to wander through, items to craft and a tech tree to explore; it's an exhaustive checklist of every trope of the modern day open world game where every component is at the very least competent. The core combat and aesthetic of Horizon Zero Dawn have been placed in fine focus; the rest, though, is something of an indistinguishable blur. Horizon Zero Dawn is a work of considerable finesse and technical bravado, but it falls into the trap of past Guerrilla games in being all too forgettable. For all its skin-deep dynamism it lacks spark; somewhat like the robotic dinosaurs that stalk its arrestingly beautiful open world, this is a mimic that's all dazzle, steel and neon yet can feel like it's operating without a heart of its own. \n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nMartin Robinson\n\n          Contributor\n        Martin worked at Eurogamer from 2011 to 2023.

There were some mechanical horses a little way over, that we could hack into, but we knew they were better used for transport than attack. We lined up a headshot on a bandit, with our bow and arrow, but before we had a chance to fire the sound of explosions and gunfire boomed from across the mesa.A giant metal, rocket-launching, Tyrannosaurs Rex had wandered onto the scene, apparently irritated by the bandits\u2019 presence. Remembering a previous encounter, where we\u2019d forced two robot tigers to fight each other, we hacked the horse anyway and sent it off into the melee. A few minutes later a badly injured Tyrannosaurs Rex was all that was left, and after a few armour-piercing arrows to his exposed weak spots we set about looting the corpses of all concerned. Welcome to Horizon Zero Dawn.As you\u2019d expect from the makers of Killzone, this is a stunning-looking game. Perhaps the most graphically accomplished of the generation. Not only that but the state-of-the-art visuals are paired with equally impressive art design, that we\u2019ve been\u00a0in love with ever since the first concept art leaked out years ago. What we were less certain of though, was that the gameplay would be anywhere close to the same standards. But thankfully it more than holds its own.Horizon Zero Dawn is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth where mankind has been reduced to a medieval, or lower, state of technology and mechanical animals roam the Earth. But although the backstory for what is going on is quite clever, and not as straightforward as you first assume, for the majority of the game you\u2019re just dealing with uninteresting tribal politics, typically workmanlike video game dialogue, and equally generic video game characters.That includes heroine Aloy, who is essentially just a bog-standard chosen one, who exhibits no real personality except during the occasional BioWare style moral decisions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad85d204-3051-4bc2-9ed9-6661bae751b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad85d204-3051-4bc2-9ed9-6661bae751b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7b2da4b-e7a1-4b00-af6c-c0da47653492", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "39d3a3e9e68fcc2f5e3d8364794e8f8d792c4500d60d115c92dd5498b82719b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "00034b39-31ea-46bf-b122-a2d8ed8fe639", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7622dbf5d853dd29332bfc7c504afbabedfae6d6ba794b73cf9fef5e4c676a4"}}, "hash": "687c561f753d12ed0fd3613d04846a26d617fe7998b3cab8cb5e3930cc215201", "text": "Some of the details of the plot, such as the matriarchal society of Aloy\u2019s tribe, are nicely unusual but overall the storytelling is one of Horizon\u2019s weaker elements. But that\u2019s fine, because as an open world game you make your own stories and the one in our opening paragraph is just one of an infinite array of unique encounters.The structure of the game though is less extraordinary, and follows the Ubisoft formula almost to the letter. The radio towers you climb to fill your map with icons are giant robotic giraffes (actually one of our favourite sub-quests) and the collectables are audio logs from before the apocalypse, but the parallels with games like Assassin\u2019s Creed and Far Cry are obvious.The gameplay mechanics are more interesting than either game has ever been though, with enjoyably straightforward platforming and stealth-based combat. Although later in the game you can use guns dropped by robots, Aloy\u2019s weapons are a spear for close-up combat, a variety of bows, and specialist equipment such as a slingshot, tripwires, and a rope gun that can tether enemies to the ground.A bow and arrow is fine against the smaller robots \u2013 as long as you get them in the eye or one of the other weak points revealed by the detective vision style accessory that kick-starts the game\u2019s plot. Others have to be dealt with much more cautiously, as you lay traps for them, lure them away with whistles or thrown rocks, or set other robots against them (you can only \u2018override\u2019 the simpler ones, unless you complete one of a number of particularly hard sub-quests into underground lairs).Things get more complicated the bigger and more powerful the robots get, as elemental weaknesses are introduced and you have to acquire weapons which can take advantage of them. Despite this, many will argue that the stealth and combat is fundamentally too simplistic, and they do have a point. Eventually you begin to realise that it\u2019s often best to just avoid the robots rather than getting into a fight, encouraging you to circumvent most of the gameplay.The artificial intelligence is quite simplistic, with everyone (and thing) suffering from the usual goldfish-like memory spans of most stealth games. Horizon is certainly not the deepest action role-player around, and it also pales next to more dedicated stealth game such as Metal Gear Solid V \u2013 which in some ways it quite closely resembles. The movement and aiming system is great though, and the way the robots interact with you and the rest of the world is unlike any other modern game.Whether it\u2019s swimming just under the water to avoid the gaze of giant mechanical birds or laying freeze traps for dinosaur-like creatures that spit fire like the bugs from Starship Troopers, the game constantly generates memorable set pieces without even trying. In fact, the more scripted scenarios often pale in comparison to the ones you just stumble upon and create yourselves.The role-playing aspects are as straightforward as the rest of the game, with a limited, very linear, set of skill trees and a trading system primarily based around the components you loot from robots. If you want to be boring about things you can farm these, and experience points, to become very powerful, very quickly. Although this is mitigated to a degree by some side-quests having quite a high experience level requirement.What\u2019s meant to further lessen the impact of the game\u2019s faults is the (robotic) elephant in the room: the fact that Horizon may well be the most graphically impressive game of the entire generation. Played on a PS4 Pro and 4K television it\u2019s absolutely staggering, with the lighting and level of detail at times seeming almost impossibly good. The game\u2019s still gorgeous on a normal PlayStation 4 though, aided by the wonderful Zoid-like creature designs.It has taken a long time for Sony, and the other publishers, to get into gear this generation, but with releases like this we finally begin to see games that do real justice to the current hardware. The gameplay design is still rooted firmly in the previous generation, but the best parts of Horizon seem as if they\u2019d be impossible on the PlayStation 3. The end result is a game that can astound you in terms of both graphics and gameplay, in what will hopefully be\u00a0a new dawn for current\u00a0gen gaming in general.In Short: State-of-the-art visuals help create one of gaming\u2019s most entertaining open worlds, even if the gameplay\u00a0doesn\u2019t quite reach the same standards.Pros: Superb graphics and art design, and a huge, impressively interactive, open world environment. Highly enjoyable combat and stealth, with an interesting array of weapons.Cons: Repetition is an issue, and resource farming can be abused.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00034b39-31ea-46bf-b122-a2d8ed8fe639": {"__data__": {"id_": "00034b39-31ea-46bf-b122-a2d8ed8fe639", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad85d204-3051-4bc2-9ed9-6661bae751b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "687c561f753d12ed0fd3613d04846a26d617fe7998b3cab8cb5e3930cc215201"}, "3": {"node_id": "b4e00c5e-72bf-477b-becb-c0dc7a39c0f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7785850f93c950e47ef5bf9ca8504019935547037d24a062fc8f9cc93379aa82"}}, "hash": "f7622dbf5d853dd29332bfc7c504afbabedfae6d6ba794b73cf9fef5e4c676a4", "text": "The backstory is interesting but the storytelling is workmanlike.Score:\u00a08/10\nFormats: PlayStation 4\nPrice: \u00a349.99\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nDeveloper: Guerrilla\nRelease Date: 1st March 2017\nAge Rating: 16Email\u00a0gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and\u00a0follow us on TwitterSign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGamesRadar+, When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

When all the calamity has died down, what\u2019s left? Horizon: Zero Dawn provides the answer. A lush, fascinatingly intricate world awaits you, but it's one that belongs to machines. They mastered it long ago. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u00a0Aloy is your robotic-wilderness prodigy, who sets off to find out why machines across the land are becoming corrupted, leading them to attack indiscriminately and spread disease. She isn\u2019t a blank slate, helper-figure you\u2019d expect from an RPG. From the start she\u2019s tenacious, with a shard of fury inside from being shunned by her matriarchal tribe for being motherless. Playing her feels like you\u2019re teaming up with someone ambitious and intelligent, her get-on-and-do-it attitude perfectly curtailing the trepidation of taking on more intimidating machines like a Stormbird or Thunderjaw. Talking to other characters lets you choose between compassionate, confrontational, or diplomatic responses, making it increasingly apparent that Aloy is the only person who dares take these beasts on. Slightly flawed but resolute, she\u2019s a fitting medium for your fearless exploits.\u00a0Let loose in a world that begs you to explore every corner, the most valuable object Aloy owns is her Focus, a gadget from the ancient world clipped to her ear. It makes getting to grips with your surroundings easy, freeing you up to feel more like a hunter. The nifty gizmo can track people, detect and tag enemies, seek out loot, or hover its electric gaze over a body part of an especially intimidating machine to see its weaknesses. Walking through ruins of the old civilisation would be a dry exercise if not for this little device, which also lets you access audio logs and texts which retain the kernel of life from thousands of years ago. Or, as the case may be, death. The death of a long-gone world, whose bones you walk over with each step.Ruins are integral to Aloy\u2019s journey and the world you find yourself in. They aren\u2019t just there to look spooky. Sure, crawling through the shell of a ruined apartment building sends shivers down my spine, but amid the rubble are tales from long ago. Voices speak to you about their fears, telling of the chaos that reigned when the cities started to collapse and society panicked. Their stories are brief, but they ground Aloy\u2019s experiences, reminding you that although life found a way to survive in the future, there are millions who didn\u2019t make it.\u00a0Replacing them are the machines. Robot animals might sound like the easiest concept to get your head around. Replace flesh with metal. Done. But they demand more credit than just being robots. Because you don\u2019t simply kill in Horizon: Zero Dawn. You hunt. I use the word because it\u2019s not a simple case of shooting machines until their circuits fizzle out. Tracking your quarry, adapting your weapon loadouts and armour, and tailoring each shot to a specific body part makes every fight between Aloy and a mechanical beast a duel. Without exception, it feels incredible.\u00a0You can mix and match perks, tailoring Aloy\u2019s skillset to fit how you want to take on the wilderness.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4e00c5e-72bf-477b-becb-c0dc7a39c0f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4e00c5e-72bf-477b-becb-c0dc7a39c0f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "00034b39-31ea-46bf-b122-a2d8ed8fe639", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7622dbf5d853dd29332bfc7c504afbabedfae6d6ba794b73cf9fef5e4c676a4"}, "3": {"node_id": "43558377-98d8-4051-a7d2-6c64c1ed3117", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "abc149e15a66c6c0581cbd6b606d1f2ce01b92c10d92c4b203c686359664abfa"}}, "hash": "7785850f93c950e47ef5bf9ca8504019935547037d24a062fc8f9cc93379aa82", "text": "Hitting one component enough times will disable it permanently, so if you like to keep your distance you can choose to rid yourself of that pesky disc launcher on the Thunderjaw\u2019s back, then pick it up and give the beast a taste of its own medicine. Or you can hide in the long grass and lure machines towards you before taking them out with a powerful silent strike. The variety of approaches means fighting never gets dull, as when you get bored of one tactic there\u2019s an alternate one just waiting for you to master. You\u2019re not super-aware of the change in your thinking until you look behind you, startled to see you\u2019ve placed enough traps and tripwires to make the perfect ambush, having already plotted a route to take once you startle the beast.11 things I wish I knew before starting Horizon: Zero DawnOne of the sole places where Horizon: Zero Dawn stalls is its lethargic jumping. Seeing as you\u2019re navigating the landscape for the whole game uninterrupted, movement is key, and trying to jump up a couple of boulders slows down what would otherwise be a fluid sense of motion. Melee attacks too suffer from this tiny but significant lag, sometimes ending up being delayed - frustrating when speed is so critical to fighting.Not that combat is always necessary. Pacifists, rejoice: you don\u2019t even have to kill the machines after a certain point. Barrelling through Cauldrons - high-level, robotic dungeons where the machines are created - will reward you with more override codes, which you can then use to hack into unsuspecting beasts and turn them to your side. Stealthy disruption suddenly becomes an option, as you can send machines off to attack their friends and create distractions while you slip away unnoticed.It's an effortlessly satisfying experience for curious explorers. There\u2019s so much to see and do. Errands, side quests, tutorial quests, and main quests (obviously) are just the beginning. Striding across the landscape are the exhilaratingly-climbable Tallnecks, who you can override to download map locations without exploring every inch yourself. For those who prefer combat to story, hunting challenges abound for you to win medals, or if you want a really challenging fight, dangerous Cauldrons lurk in the mountains - mysterious robotic wombs that seem more organism than machine. That\u2019s not even mentioning the ruins textured with secrets about the past, the collectables to find, the bandit camps to eradicate\u2026 the variety of choice is overwhelming.\u00a0Each quest stacks up to build a world brimming with potential. It\u2019s not all about the machines either, as the tribes are just as unforgettable. Political squabbles await between the proud Carja, the inventive Oseram, mystic Banuk, and traditional Nora, dragging you deeper into the social tapestry. Some quests recruit Aloy to investigate mysteries like a detective using your Focus, encouraging you to linger in the beautifully crafted settlements. Aloy\u2019s journey is about people just as much as machines: about how humanity continues to adapt, turning a historical calamity to their advantage.Even small details like the layout of the inventory helps you get to grips with the game without being intrusive. There's no clumsy crowd of items here: resources are marked with what they\u2019re good for (crafting ammo or upgrades, trading for other items, or selling) as well as a list of machines you can get more of them from. A catalogue of all the robotic beasts you\u2019ve run into gives you details of their weaknesses and attacks so you can consult it before fighting, and come up with your tactics. A small detail admittedly, but just glancing at it familiarises you with the intricacies of the world without going through an exhaustive tutorial. What it comes down to is that Aloy knows her stuff. It\u2019s up to you to get the best out of her.\u00a0Like a real ecosystem, Horizon: Zero Dawn is brilliantly balanced. Aloy feels like an inextricable part of it, halfway between prey and predator. Whether you\u2019re climbing cliff-faces with a weightless, fluid joy, hunting, or travelling through the landscape, Horizon: Zero Dawn takes you on a tour of discovery. An endless sense of wonder and awe push you onward no matter what you\u2019re doing. The more time I spend in Horizon: Zero Dawn\u2019s world, the less I want to leave.\u00a0Want to get more from Aloy's adventure?

Futurist tech of a distant past lay buried as beast-like machines roam the surface of a new world where civilizations thrive as hunters and gatherers living off the land. And as you slowly unravel the complicated past of Aloy, our protagonist, you come to grips with the calamitous truth of what led to the world as they know it. I spent around 12 hours with the PC version in pre-launch form to evaluate this port of a once-PS4-exclusive from 2017, and it has come with mixed results.Horizon Zero Dawn remains a visually enticing game with rich natural environments and snow-capped mountains to trek through, all of which can look better than they did on PS4 and PS4 Pro if you have the right PC specs. Given the density of certain towns or villages, or chaos of some combat scenarios, frame rate can take a considerable dip, making it a fairly demanding game, but it may also noticeably stutter occasionally, making for some inconsistent performance. (I've used a Core i7-7700K, RTX 2080, and 16GB of RAM at ultrawide 2560x1080 resolution using maximum settings and TAA, and had dips to around 35-40 FPS in those intense moments.)You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Horizon: Zero Dawn Video ReviewSome game-affecting bugs have been present in my experience as well. The Concentration mechanic--which lets you zoom in and slow down time to carefully aim your bow--simply does not slow down time. Pulling up the weapon wheel should also slow down time, but it does not in my case. These are key mechanics that are useful in the game's many combat situations, but are not functioning properly at the moment. However, a day-one patch is planned for release this week, and I'll update this note once that lands.Overall, Horizon Zero Dawn can be a fascinating open world action game--it goes to great lengths in building out its world and establishes an excellent combat system that relies on precision aiming and outsmarting enemies with its many tools and weapons. It does need some work on the technical side, though. -- Michael Higham, August 5, 2020Our original Horizon Zero Dawn review, first published on February 20, 2017, continues below.A society with a foggy past and an uncertain future is truly lost; such is the reality for the denizens of the world of Horizon Zero Dawn. Roughly 1,000 years from today, tribal communities lead primitive lives, surrounded by mysterious high-tech fossils of the Old Ones--the fractured legacy of our real world, the result of technological advancement run amok.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a206fe9-693f-465f-9002-d933e1bdecf6": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a206fe9-693f-465f-9002-d933e1bdecf6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "43558377-98d8-4051-a7d2-6c64c1ed3117", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "abc149e15a66c6c0581cbd6b606d1f2ce01b92c10d92c4b203c686359664abfa"}, "3": {"node_id": "3af6e9ca-87da-491a-8d42-c57f6fe0ac23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae4af4731e0f8e72a07cf28dd59a7ccfc0eb5d47594a547a582d52a766c85ea6"}}, "hash": "16f1a15110ba0b42d9c24776f982b7923114a982143edf08ef07663a70a38262", "text": "Diminutive animals like rabbits and boars still roam the wild, but they trot in the footsteps of imposing mechanical beasts that dominantly stride through dense jungles and lurk on snowy mountain tops.How the world ended up in disarray isn't clear at first, but Aloy, an orphaned outcast who locates an advanced communications and analysis device, holds the key to unlocking these mysteries. Using her newfound tool--known as a Focus--you can tap into techno-artifacts and glean info about the past. While the full story of the world's downfall takes a while to unravel, the fascinating revelations you eventually uncover more than make up for time spent navigating less-than-compelling tribal politics during the first half of the game.The dueling themes of nature and technology are present in Aloy, who's forever changed when she accepts technology into her otherwise primitive life. She transforms in so many ways throughout her journey, and it's amazing to look back when all is said and done, reflecting on not just the awesome challenges you've overcome, but also on how much confidence and maturity Aloy's gained in the process.But no matter where the story takes you, combat--deservedly--owns the spotlight. The world's intricately crafted environments teem with electric beasts and warfaring cultists, and the pronounced excitement of controlling Aloy in the midst of rampaging enemies is a near-constant thrill.This excitement comes in part from Aloy's ability to deftly leap out of harm's way and bound right back into action, but her arsenal of weapons and ammunition are the special ingredients that give you the ability to topple Zero Dawn's massive robotic monsters with power and style. You start with a simple bow and arrows, but you eventually gain access to elementally charged bolts, slingshots that lob explosives, and an assortment of traps that can surprise or constrict unsuspecting enemies.Juggling these tools mid-fight is made easy by a weapon wheel that opens with the tilt of the right analog stick and slows down time to give you a moment to plan. It's simple to get the hang of, and you never have to put yourself in too much danger when looking for your weapon of choice; you can still run, dodge, and jump while accessing the wheel.Dodge-rolling between enemies, turning around, and jumping to deliver a critical blow while drawing and aiming your bow in slow-motion never gets old. There are no actual supernatural powers on display, unless you count the fact that Aloy's Focus can pinpoint enemy weak points. Nevertheless, when the controls seep into your subconscious, heroic displays of cunning, might, and fearlessness lend Aloy a superhuman quality. You can employ basic stealth tactics and sneak up on enemies, but when you're properly armed, there's hardly a compelling reason to deny yourself the pleasure of Zero Dawn's head-on engagements.While sprinting around the battlefield and fighting with a range of projectiles makes for a great time, melee combat is unfortunately less effective. Your only options are light or heavy spear attacks, and when fighting indoors, you're more likely to hit a wall than your intended target. Furthermore, where spear-wielding enemies can block incoming attacks, you cannot, putting you at an immediate disadvantage when relying on your spear. But you're never forced to use melee, and can always revert to fighting with a mix of evasive maneuvers and projectile weaponry.When the controls seep into your subconscious, heroic displays of cunning, might, and fearlessness lend Aloy a superhuman quality.To keep fights interesting over dozens of hours, Zero Dawn doles out new robotic enemies at a gratifying pace, introducing slightly larger and more complex beasts by the time you gain mastery over less challenging foes. Where you may face small bipedal Watchers as well as approximations of horses and bulls at the start, you eventually engage with rampaging armored crocodiles, jaguar-like bots with cloaking devices, and, yes, giant enemy crabs. By the end of the game, you can confidently roll into battle facing a towering metallic T-Rex knowing full well that you are in control, despite your relatively diminutive stature.Being an effective hunter in Zero Dawn requires one part execution and one part knowledge--namely, understanding what enemies are capable of and what parts of their body are most vulnerable. A well-placed shot on a body part that glows through the use of Aloy's Focus can knock off a piece of armor and expose a robot's vulnerable innards. It's also possible to disarm enemies and use their own weapons against them. Your standard weapons are effective enough, but nothing beats finishing a fight with a massive laser cannon you've earned through tactful aggression.Zero Dawn's map is predominantly wild, but tribal settlements are easy to find.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3af6e9ca-87da-491a-8d42-c57f6fe0ac23": {"__data__": {"id_": "3af6e9ca-87da-491a-8d42-c57f6fe0ac23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a206fe9-693f-465f-9002-d933e1bdecf6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "16f1a15110ba0b42d9c24776f982b7923114a982143edf08ef07663a70a38262"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4118fe1-c421-418b-a130-813de954da29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "18f11aae3c9013f57f415b26c9f654c42b2191aae0e8cc31646ff092b9719e9c"}}, "hash": "ae4af4731e0f8e72a07cf28dd59a7ccfc0eb5d47594a547a582d52a766c85ea6", "text": "Most are modest--just a few shacks and a store--but a handful of miniature kingdoms offer sizable populations of merchants and quest-givers. At best, typical side quests are vehicles that propel you into the far-reaching wild with some semblance of narrative motivation, but it's common to find the personality of the quest giver more interesting than the ultimate meaning behind your objective. With larger questions and fates at play in the main quest, Zero Dawn's sub-stories simply can't compete.While combat is at the forefront of Zero Dawn, you habitually gather any resource in reach as you travel from point A to point B. Plants and pieces of animals and robots alike are necessary for crafting Aloy's ammunition and traps, upgrading item storage, and brewing health potions. When it comes to making items, it's as simple as looking through a crafting menu and seeing what is or isn't available based on your current stash of resources. Selling items is a painful process, however, as there's no way to sort your inventory. You have to scroll through a gallery grid of up to 100 icons and manually read details to determine what to keep and what to sell. For a game that manages to handle complex systems in real-time with aplomb, it's odd to see something as basic as inventory management feel like an afterthought.There are sets of rare artifacts to find in the wild, though the material rewards you get for collecting an entire set and trading it to a merchant are a bit of a letdown. While this realization comes as a slightly sour note, any excuse to look around a new corner or down a new valley is a good excuse to jump back into battle. And don't write Zero Dawn's open-world off just yet; items aren't all it has to offer.A handful of alien-like constructs lie embedded in the earth, and at the heart of each of these intricate, otherworldly dungeons is a machine that will give you the power to hack a specific category of robotic animals. Some robots will simply fight on your side or leave you alone when hacked, but a few allow you to ride on their backs. Granted, this option is limited--no, you can't ride a robot T-Rex--but it's the one argument for the game's stealth mechanics, as you can only hack a robot by sneaking up to it.Looking beyond your reward for conquering these high-tech dungeons, they also exist as the antithesis to the natural splendor that permeates most of Zero Dawn. Yet from the heat of dusty plateaus to the cool shadows of metal monstrosities, you'll feel at home no matter where you travel. This is because Aloy and the beasts she topples are walking embodiments of the dueling themes that define their world. Zero Dawn is a bit too concerned about establishing its primitive side at times, but by and large it does a fantastic job of bringing its two halves together for a truly captivating experience.This is the first departure from the Killzone series for developer Guerrilla Games, and though you might think the team took a risk by stepping out of its FPS comfort zone to create a third-person open-world action game, you'd never know it was their first rodeo. For every minor imperfection, there's an element of greatness that recharges your desire to keep fighting and exploring Zero Dawn's beautiful and perilous world. Guerrilla Games has delivered one of the best open-world games of this generation, and redefined its team's reputation in the process.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, \n        By Philip Kollar\non February 20, 2017\n            at 3:01am\n          \n\nHorizon Zero Dawn feels, in some ways, like a refutation of developer Guerrilla Games' nearly 20-year history.Since being founded in 2000, this Amsterdam-based studio has stuck almost entirely to a single series: the drab sci-fi shooter franchise Killzone. The successes and failures of individual entries in that franchise have varied \u2014 2009's Killzone 2 was arguably a high point, while PlayStation 4 launch title Killzone: Shadow Fall was a disappointment \u2014 but regardless, Killzone has never really seemed to catch on in the gaming zeitgeist compared to popular competitors like Halo and Call of Duty.It seemed like Guerrilla Games might be trapped churning out Killzone games forever until the surprise announcement of Horizon Zero Dawn at E3 2015. Here was something stunningly different from the moody, dark shooter heritage of this team: a gorgeous, colorful, third-person open-world game that focused on tracking and hunting massive robotic beasts. Could they really do this?The answer is yes. Horizon Zero Dawn is a refreshing change of pace for Guerrilla Games.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4118fe1-c421-418b-a130-813de954da29": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4118fe1-c421-418b-a130-813de954da29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "3af6e9ca-87da-491a-8d42-c57f6fe0ac23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae4af4731e0f8e72a07cf28dd59a7ccfc0eb5d47594a547a582d52a766c85ea6"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5baa368-bb97-4fbe-80bb-4d334ac027cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1f21c2147b837b683d1c33ffc85e849154f64e4b151ed4195df4de037649571"}}, "hash": "18f11aae3c9013f57f415b26c9f654c42b2191aae0e8cc31646ff092b9719e9c", "text": "Horizon Zero Dawn is a refreshing change of pace for Guerrilla Games. While playing it, I couldn't shake the feeling that this game was made by people excited to be working on it, and that excitement was contagious.Horizon Zero Dawn is a post-apocalyptic game, but not of the variety we've seen lots of in games like Fallout 4 and The Last of Us. It is post-post-post-apocalypse: hundreds if not thousands of years after whatever catastrophe befell society. In this strange, barely familiar world, the massive skyscrapers and technology of our modern civilization have been abandoned. What humans remain form tribes, hunting with bows and spears and living a life shaped around an earth-based, shamanistic religion.These human tribes also have to contend with another force for survival: the machines, giant robots that resemble dinosaurs and other animals. These terrifying opponents were left behind by the Ancient Ones, before the old world ended, and little is known about them other than that they're equipped with weaponry and power that humans of the new world simply can't compete with.It's in this vision of the future that players take control of Aloy, a talented young huntress cast out from her tribe and desperately seeking answers about where she came from. Though she is in many ways the traditional video game protagonist \u2014 brisk in speech, unstoppable in power, ready and willing to go along with whatever quest she is given \u2014 she provides a perfect pair of curious eyes to slowly reveal the mysteries of this world.Those mysteries are a driving force in Horizon Zero Dawn, so I'll only say that the game surprised me in numerous ways. It's darker than I expected in its imagining of what ended civilization, but it's also more hopeful regarding humanity's chances at continued existence. Aloy herself is largely a tool accomplishing the needs of the game, but Horizon's cast of characters was strong enough to earn my investment.That cast includes characters like the drunken warrior Erend, the new-to-the-throne and progressive-minded Sun King Avad and the mysterious, omniscient Sylens. It's a cast whose progress through the story I was eager to witness, and the political maneuvering of the world of Horizon weaves myriad opportunities for intrigue both in this game and the future. Horizon Zero Dawn answers the vast majority of the questions it presents. It leaves characters with arcs that feel completed but also a bear sense of continuity, of possible direction for the future. It builds in the potential for sequels and spinoffs, but in a smart, natural way, without the need for frustrating cliffhangers or unresolved plot threads.(OK, there's one tiny thread left over in the post-credits stinger, but I found the game's handling of this tease more clever than cynical.)Aloy herself may not be an incredibly deep character, but she grounds Horizon's gameplay via a wide array of combat abilities that grows as the game progresses. Through both crafting new weapons and items and learning new skills via leveling up, Aloy grows from an above-average hunter to a woman revered across the land as an unstoppable machine killer. While she's up against technological nightmares, Aloy embraces technology in a way other members of her tribe do not.Early in her life, she discovers a strange item called a \"focus\" that allows her to scan the environment and see trails left by people. Aloy uses the focus quite a bit in quests and story moments, but it's also a key to combat. The focus allows you to see the weak points on your robot enemies, which means even if you're using a bow and arrow or slingshot against them, you can target the exact points that will do the most damage.Fighting the machines in Horizon Zero Dawn \u2014 especially the larger ones \u2014 is a thrilling, exhausting experience, one that improves over time as Aloy buys and crafts more tools, opening up more options to take the beasts down. At the beginning, I used my bow and arrow for everything, even when it was just slowly chipping away small bits of damage; by the end, I was smoothly and swiftly switching between shooting fire arrows at flammable fuel tanks, tossing shock traps on the ground to stun robots, and lobbing ice bombs that could freeze enemies in place and open them up to further damage.Horizon encourages you to use the widest possible variety of options at your disposal, as well. The bigger the robot, the more of a struggle the fight is. Aloy's tasks aren't difficult, exactly. Rather, larger robots just have a lot of health, and they're big and imposing, and they can take out a good chunk of your health bar with one stomp or laser blast. You need to approach fights prepared, with a backpack full of resources so you can craft more ammo or potions on the fly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5baa368-bb97-4fbe-80bb-4d334ac027cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5baa368-bb97-4fbe-80bb-4d334ac027cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4118fe1-c421-418b-a130-813de954da29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "18f11aae3c9013f57f415b26c9f654c42b2191aae0e8cc31646ff092b9719e9c"}, "3": {"node_id": "372349e9-75a5-48b4-958b-6c41c8a0aa72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "85c2c56b5665b7d1b1fa6c7b0638b30da244193ce919f48728b5ed2777bcc0ab"}}, "hash": "d1f21c2147b837b683d1c33ffc85e849154f64e4b151ed4195df4de037649571", "text": "The only times I got frustrated were when I stubbornly stuck to one tactic with a harder enemy instead of varying my techniques. But when I actually used everything I could to bring down the biggest robots, it was immensely satisfying.Combat is only one part of a cycle in Horizon Zero Dawn: You stock up on supplies to take down a foe, you fight that enemy, then you harvest its metal insides and use those parts to craft new weapons and armor and more supplies for taking on the next giant machine you come across. It's a tried-and-true formula, something popularized in series like Monster Hunter, but it's never been pulled off with the AAA polish and approachability that's on display here. If \"approachability\" reads to you as \"less depth,\" you're not wrong, but it's a trade-off that works to Horizon's advantage.Horizon's gorgeously crafted world is another element in its favor, but first you have to get over its one visual shortcoming: the character models. Aloy and her rotating cast of companions look nice enough in action, but during lengthy dialogue sequences, characters are static and unnerving in a way that skirts the uncanny valley. The world itself, however, is just plain beautiful. From witnessing a crimson sunset across a mountain range to seeing the land naturally shift from a desert to a lush jungle, Horizon made the act of running from location to location within its world a huge part of the fun.In fact, you'll run into robots far more during these long stretches of exploring than you will during story quests, and these encounters make for some of the most memorable moments in the game. For example, there were the numerous times that I took out a whole herd of grazers (robots that look like deer) completely using stealth, just to build up supplies. Or the epic confrontation I had with two robot sandworms, where I managed to just barely defeat them with all of my potions and resources drained, only for a flock of glinthawks (a sort-of machine pterodactyl that shoots ice) to swoop down and feast on the worm's corpses until they noticed me. I didn't survive that one.Honestly, the only notably mundane moments in Horizon are the points where the game makes you fight against other humans, which happens just a little too often during the main quest. Where each type of robot requires unique strategies and a strong sense of your surroundings to succeed, fights against humans feel like far less interesting resource and skill checks. Can you quickly aim at enemies' heads to bring them down in one or two arrows, rather than the dozen or so body shots necessary? And if not, do you have enough health potions to survive as the opposing humans pelt you with arrows? Then you're all good; not much else to it.\nThose duller moments are a footnote, however, and they did little to slow down the game's momentum and my interest in it. Horizon Zero Dawn thrums with the energy of a creative team finally allowed to explore something new. It builds on elements of open-world and loot-and-craft gameplay that we've seen before, but it does so within a context, a setting and a style that feel fresh.

The PS4\u2019s newest exclusive, Horizon Zero Dawn, is the rare game that delivers on that promise.To play Guerilla Games\u2019 Horizon Zero Dawn is to feel awe. Awe over sheer technical wizardry and its ability to transport you into a new world. Awe over discovering gargantuan mechanical dinosaurs and gradually uncovering the mysteries of a lost civilization. Awe over the fact I have never seen so many kickass women in a first party big-budget game, much less this many people of color in key roles. I often found myself pausing the game just to marvel at it all.Horizon Zero Dawn is a third-person action game that tells the story of a relentless young woman named Aloy, who, for reasons unknown, was cast out of the Nora tribe at birth. Instead of accepting her fate as an outsider, Aloy dedicates her life to combat and survival training. Her goal is to participate in a Nora ceremony known as The Proving, as custom dictates that anybody who wins the trial can ask for whatever they want. Aloy intends to find out the truth of her parentage and why she was never given a chance to be a real part of society.From there, the game sprawls out into a post-post-apocalyptic wonderland of mechanized beasts, ancient ruins, and societies that have lost their knowledge of the old world. The intrigue is immediate in Horizon  Zero Dawn, expertly woven by former lead Fallout: New Vegas writer John Gonzalez. At first, that story was my lifeline, giving me a thread to follow in an open world with an overwhelming number of things to do:As I explored the terrain before me, I saw a different seduction take hold, eventually compelling me to explore each and every icon on the map. Horizon Zero Dawn is actually a game about hunting, and your marks are a kingdom of vicious metal dinosaurs:Each monster has a preferred territory and comes equipped with its own strengths, weaknesses, and attack repertoire. Initially armed with nothing more than a bow, arrow, and spear, you must take on each Goliath before it tears you apart. Horizon Zero Dawn usually gives you a few options for any given encounter.Perhaps you are the roguish type who prefers sticking to the shadows, killing your enemies one-by-one without arousing suspicion. Maybe you like to override your foes, making them fight against each other. I preferred running headfirst into my encounters, unloading my ammo however I could\u2014if it hit my target, great! This quickly invited disaster. Horizon Zero Dawn requires precision and planning, asking you to consider your mark before taking it on. Using a technology called a \u201cFocus,\u201d you can scan your enemies to learn about vulnerabilities, allowing you to direct your attacks with purpose. There is some trial and error involved in learning what makes each creature tick, a quality reminiscent of Monster Hunter.Horizon\u2019s interlocking combat systems shine once you learn how to prepare for encounters. Before setting off on a quest, I would hunt small game to craft health potions and collect materials for traps. Scoping out the land, I would set up a proximity mine here, or an electronic tripwire there, all in anticipation of my target\u2019s movements. Once I gained enough currency to afford it, I also considered the most appropriate weaponry.It\u2019s much easier to hit flying enemies by tying them down with a \u201cRopecaster,\u201d for example, whereas close-combat guns help thwart rushing T-Rexes. Each weapon has its own feel, and while they are all enjoyable to use, I preferred the simplicity of the bow and arrow. Taking aim, pulling the bowstring back, and releasing each individual shot is tried, true, and classic.Having the ability to infuse weapons with elemental affinities adds another dimension, allowing you to detonate metal canisters with fire shots or freeze your target with ice.

I\u2019m fond of the \u201cconcentration\u201d ability that slows down time, allowing you to pinpoint specific parts of enemy armor for added advantage. Admittedly there are so many options for approaching combat that I sometimes forgot make use of them until I hit a new wall in difficulty.Horizon\u2019s story insists that Aloy is an extraordinary woman who does whatever it takes to save the day, but the writing characterizing her does not convey that as effectively as the heat of combat. Sometimes, I could feel my heart racing as I made Aloy duck and weave against seemingly impossible odds. In a particularly memorable encounter that took hours for me to grok, I took down an enormous rock worm that had been terrorizing a nearby town. At the end, Aloy  stood above its smoking carcass. It was dead through the sheer force of her\u2014and my\u2014will. I found myself catching my breath.The first time you take down any of the game\u2019s creatures is usually remarkable. That novelty fades after repeated encounters with those same types of monsters later in the game. The main Horizon storyline ramps up by throwing more of the same at you, a strategy that technically heightens the difficulty while robbing the mechs of their distinct flavor. Still, the dinosaurs are by far Horizon Zero Dawn\u2019s crowning achievement, and I found myself exploring new areas of map in the hopes of encountering something I had not seen before. By comparison, fighting humans, which is something players will do a lot, is boring and unwelcome. Unfortunately, Horizon\u2019s main quest relies on those human encounters too heavily. I found myself taking refuge in the sidequests just to avoid other people.Traversing the world is treacherous, but fortunately Aloy is very nimble. You might draw a comparison to Tomb Raider or Uncharted as you climb structures of dubious structural integrity, or spelunk ruins and \u201cCauldrons\u201d with hidden treasures. Actually, Horizon seems to borrow mechanics liberally from many other games. The dialogue system feels a little Mass Effect, for example, in that your choices are accompanied with intention icons, and sometimes, there are even future consequences for your decisions. Then there\u2019s the Focus vision, which you can use to investigate scenes more closely, Batman-style. Guerilla Games implements these systems solidly, but none reach the heights of the combat mechanics. They get the job done.Horizon does shake up one familiar design trope. Many open world games include towers that you must climb to expose the surrounding area, and while those are present in Horizon, a tower in this game is an actual wandering dinosaur.The game builds an interesting sci-fi world. Even though I anticipated a few of the game\u2019s plot developments, Horizon kept me hooked through believable, flawed characters who live in a world they do not fully understand. It\u2019s curious to hear people theorize about the way the old world used to work: you have tall tales woven around objects like coffee mugs, and religious beliefs formed around technology that seems indistinguishable from magic. It also helps that Horizon\u2019s mix of high-tech and low-tech makes for a killer aesthetic that is further accentuated through the game\u2019s distinct tribes.The aesthetic richness of the world is undermined by a lack of interactive diversity. I was  always thrilled to find new settlements, especially given the painstaking detail of each individual building block, but I wanted to do more in them. Towns and cities felt more like static dollhouses where I only stopped to save and stock up on supplies. I couldn\u2019t really interact with anybody outside of a few key characters in a meaningful way, nor did Horizon provide locale-defining activities to enjoy. Individual cities feel distinct from each other only in an abstract way, when characters describe the politics going on in the background. You might learn, for example, that one city is currently at war or on the verge of collapse, but you don\u2019t really see or feel any of that while walking through its roads or talking to its citizens. Everything is just a springboard for you to get back into the world to kill dinosaurs, and thankfully, that\u2019s where the game shines brightest.Instead, where Horizon blew me away was in the majestic and untamed beauty of its canyons, mountains, and open fields. I often found myself booting up Horizon\u2019s robust photo mode just to take stock of it all. This generation has seen its fair share of gorgeous games, sure, but the artistry at work here is staggering. The mere act of walking through this lavish world is enough to make me fall in love with individual rocks and clouds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d939abd4-5fd8-477b-b35a-df8efbf678b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d939abd4-5fd8-477b-b35a-df8efbf678b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "b97bd6c2-d2a8-4ca8-af20-66b51c227f3e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e89f926ac56de9a3f175f758917e0db68ea8b0d7ac29cf90b7679805637806f"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa593e2f-55bb-4cc0-bfc0-28e53025eb62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a5b6df5a3ccde4d2f1129afe3ff431f8ce3e93ac002fec33a2e422bb69ae242d"}}, "hash": "d235e07b46d9124a5d376140ba389fa80e037ff0043c9b30ee9bd393ea1df452", "text": "Horizon provides a compelling case for how, in the right hands, computing power can be leveraged to bring a setting to life.

Clarke's third law, which states that \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" What would happen if only one person had the world at her fingertips? If only one person had access to a smart phone and the entirety of the internet, what advantages might that give them over their peers? Replace \"smart phone\" with \"networked augmented reality device,\" set things in a tribal world where anything the world's inhabitants don't understand is likely to be worshiped as a god, and you've got the basic setup for Guerrilla's thrilling new game.That tribal world is Earth, in a far-flung future where tribal society is the order of the day. Hunters hunt with bows and spears, but in addition to boars, turkeys, and rabbits, deadly, animal-like machines also roam the landscape. Metal ruins of the old world lie below. This is where players enter the picture as a young girl named Aloy. As a child, Aloy falls into one of these forbidden ruins and finds a \"focus,\" the aforementioned augmented reality device. Suddenly, there's a whole new layer to her world. She can extract data from computers, detect broadcasts, and analyze her environment in a \"Batman detective vision\" sort of way. This ends up making Aloy far more deadly with her bow, spear, and other weapons, too.It also means that Aloy's story progresses along two branches. At first, she's the tribal outcast, attempting to gain favor in her small community and avenge the death of her caretaker. But as she ventures further and further away from her old village, she begins working with and against numerous other factions. The focus attached to her face also means that she's quickly thrust into quests that get her closer and closer to the truth behind the nature of the world itself. Why are they there? What happened to the ancient humans that came before her? Where the hell did all these vicious machines come from? Who made them? Who continues to make them? What do they want? The surface level \"this faction of this tribe wants to take the city from this other faction\" stuff is fine, but once the game starts making good on its initial setup and letting you peek behind the curtain, the story shifts into a higher gear.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa593e2f-55bb-4cc0-bfc0-28e53025eb62": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa593e2f-55bb-4cc0-bfc0-28e53025eb62", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "d939abd4-5fd8-477b-b35a-df8efbf678b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d235e07b46d9124a5d376140ba389fa80e037ff0043c9b30ee9bd393ea1df452"}, "3": {"node_id": "705aadd4-a44d-44b5-a6be-adf5a9629993", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d869e6abb760f7f3d8f76862770f1bcc0f23a8aa4c1d88dc0011773669704af"}}, "hash": "a5b6df5a3ccde4d2f1129afe3ff431f8ce3e93ac002fec33a2e422bb69ae242d", "text": "It's a fantastic science fiction tale that expertly hangs the next piece of information just out of reach without feeling like it's stretching its information out too thinly. I thought the game was coming to an end around two-thirds of the way through, only to discover that there were multiple hours of mainline gameplay left to experience and additional answers to seek.By the end, Horizon comes to a satisfying conclusion in a way that left me feeling like they should probably never make a sequel. It's a near-perfect story that creates a world and also provides meaningful answers about said world. Not to soapbox about it, but games don't do that often enough anymore. The events of Horizon have weight and the game feels less like franchise building and more like a cohesive statement. Of course, the developers couldn't help but leave in one little bit that hints about what might happen if and when they decide to make another one, which I found to be a little unfortunate. But I guess that's business.Zero Dawn is structured quite a bit like the recent Far Cry games. You'll level up, gain new abilities by slapping points onto a skill tree, and hunt for crafting materials that let you hold more things in your inventory. You'll happen upon a handful of bandit camps, tag enemies, and try to prevent them from setting off an alarm if you're spotted. You'll climb a few things to reveal objectives on the map, but the game manages to craft a decent take on that concept that doesn't overstay its welcome. The stealth is satisfying, though some of the options you get to handle enemies can be a little game-breaking. For example, hiding in tall grass means you're effectively invisible, provided you haven't already been spotted. Early on, you can choose an ability that lets you whistle. It only ever alerts a single enemy, and that enemy comes right over to you, where you can take them out (unless they're one of the larger machines or armored humans) with a \"silent strike.\" That doesn't alert the other enemies, usually, so you can do it again and again, clearing out entire areas with zero risk.Open combat is more exciting, but it can also be slightly clunky. You always have a spear, which has a light and heavy attack. After some upgrades, a couple of heavy strikes will knock an enemy over, letting you jab them with a critical strike. The ranged combat is a bit more varied, though I never felt the need to use some of the fancier weapons, like a ropecaster that lets you strap enemies down, effectively knocking them over the same way your heavy melee strikes can. Or the tripcaster, which lets you set traps for enemies. The weapons work as advertised, but the different bows and arrow types always felt like the star of the show to me.Fighting machines, especially bigger ones, gets easier if you pay attention to an enemy's weak points. You can knock off armor pieces and components as you fight, so disabling a stalker's stealth generator will make it unable to become cloaked. Knocking the gun off the top of a big cat machine means it can't shoot at you, and so on. There are lots of bits to chip off of larger enemies, and reducing their effectiveness is a great way to survive the larger fights. You'll have elemental arrows to exploit specific weaknesses, and a type of damage called \"tear\" is specifically designed to help you strip the machines clean before you start moving in for the kill. This leads to a few cheap moments where you can Skyrim-hop your way up the side of a mountain, where a machine can't follow, then patiently strip off every single piece from complete safety. But, by and large, it's an exciting system that makes every shot count and ratchets up tension in the bigger fights. Of course, if fighting isn't your thing you can reduce the number of encounters by learning how to override the machines, which tames them and makes them aggressive toward your enemies. Or you could always fire corruption arrows to confuse them into attacking each other... point being, the game has some nice options that'll let you play the encounters a few different ways.The overall story is solid, but the moment-to-moment dialogue is also quite good. Even some of the smaller quests get their own fascinating twists and turns, and characters often defy expectations in welcome ways. Aloy is well-voiced as a character caught between worlds, someone who has to try to explain advanced technology to a bunch of religious zealots who think she's either the second coming or a demon herself. It all makes for a really refreshing experience that zigged when I assumed it would definitely zag on a few different occasions.

All in all, it's a great game, it's Guerrilla's strongest release to date, and I suspect I'll go back in after the fact to clean up whatever side quests and errands I have remaining, if only to spend a little more time in that world.\u00a9 2023 FANDOM, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\nUse your keyboard!Log in to comment\nUSgamer, Horizon Zero Dawn is going to make other open-world developers sick with envy. \n \nBefore I played Horizon Zero Dawn I spoke with a senior producer at Guerrilla Games. He told me fans of RPGs from the last few years would really enjoy it.I didn\u2019t understand this at the time, but about two hours into Horizon Zero Dawn the comment fell into place. This game owes a great deal to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt \u2013 and that\u2019s not something we complain about hereabouts.It is The Witcher 3 of post-post-apocalyptic robo-dino adventures; it is the sort of thing Ubisoft will wish you had never seen if it dares to release another time-sucking, glitch-filled Assassin\u2019s Creed.The similarities between The Witcher 3 and Horizon Zero Dawn are too numerous to waste space on, but you could also find a lot of comparables in, say, Rise of the Tomb Raider. If you have played either of those games, you already know what to expect from Horizon Zero Dawn: a bristling combat toolbox, customisation through skill choices and gear, a large map studded with distractions and narrative-driven missions to take you from zone to zone.You also know whether you like that style of game or not - but not whether you have room in your life for another one. Suffering open world fatigue as I am (even very good 40, 60 and 100 hour games are a penance to games writers), I myself went into Horizon Zero Dawn wondering what it had to set it above or even alongside magnificent efforts from CD Projekt RED and Crystal Dynamics.Some people are going to say it\u2019s the beauty of Horizon Zero Dawn\u2019s world, which stands amongst the best the medium has ever produced, and possibly bypasses them for sheer technical achievement.Others are going to say the story of Aloy and the post-post-apocalyptic setting; certainly the narrative is compelling enough and falls into a better rhythm after the awkward Assassins Creed 2-style tutorial opening, and the key characters are varied and distinct.For my money, it\u2019s two things: the combat and the perfection of the package.\n\n\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies.\n\nManage cookie settings  \n \nWatch on YouTubeCombat in Horizon Zero Dawn is more forgiving than The Witcher 3, but on normal difficulty most fights ask more of you than to just run in swinging your spear about and hoping for the best.Though neither human foes nor individual machines are a real problem, enemies attack in numbers and combinations, which prevent you relying on any one tool  and can rapidly overwhelm you. While you can duel single opponents action-style with rolls and well-timed heavy and light swings, in almost every single encounter you\u2019ll be bashed off your feet by its pals before you can get more than a couple of hits in.Fights ask more of you than to just run in swinging your spear about and hoping for the best.This never changes even as you acquire better gear and a larger health pool: 15 levels above the recommended range on one side quest, and with gear far beyond what I ought to have had at that stage in the game, a single error against a boss ate most of my health bar and I had to leg it for breathing room to spam potions.Rather than being a matter of raw level numbers, success is all about knowing what you\u2019re getting into and approaching the encounter with a strategy. Will you take out the smaller beasts by stealth before diving into the fray? Would it be better to go in scattering bombs around, or to and rope the larger foes down while you clean up? What if you start by knocking off the component that gives the big baddie an advantage here \u2013 or blows nearby baddies up?

You\u2019re not tempted to spend the whole game looking at the world through a purple haze, instead using it to tag enemies and prepare for combat in advance \u2013 in turn reducing the amount of time you\u2019ll spend changing equipment in the menu mid-battle. The first time you encounter a machine its information goes into the encyclopedia, which is the most usable example of its kind I\u2019ve ever seen. The variety of beasts in Horizon Zero Dawn isn\u2019t so enormous that you can\u2019t remember which one is which, but if it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve seen a particular kind of enemy it\u2019s really easy to quickly locate the relevant info, rather than having to poke through a half dozen screens to see how many bits can be knocked off (your Focus can also supply this intel on the fly, but it\u2019s hard to use in the middle of a fight if you\u2019re surprised by something). \n \nOnce you\u2019re armed with knowledge, you arm yourself with actual arms, and Horizon Zero Dawn has at least 17 different types of ranged attack spread across seven weapons, in addition to melee capabilities. Juggling your weapon options to match the situation at hand is key. You can only equip four at once, and it\u2019s impossible to cover all possibilities with one load out.Some of the ranged attacks seem to double up in effect at first, but I came to appreciate the subtle differences between them. A very small number of these options fall flat, like the component harvesting arrow in a game where resources rain upon you from all angles. With this much variety it\u2019s not surprising some elements of the sandbox are less compelling, though.Incidentally, the combat challenge side missions in Horizon Zero Dawn are actually very good. Rather than being twitch-based tests of skill, which so often puts 100% completion out of my reach in open world games, they\u2019re more like puzzles \u2013 if you find the right gear and adopt the right tactics you\u2019ll ace them. This teaches you skills useful for everywhere else, most notably the capacity to think creatively about your tools and how to combine them with each other and the environment. The tutorial quests for each weapon, which offer generous XP rewards and don\u2019t force themselves on you, are another excellent touch. \n \nThe combat and preparing for it make up the core gameplay loop of Horizon Zero Dawn, and until you\u2019ve seen and defeated every type of baddie in every combination, not to mention their more powerful Corrupted forms, you won\u2019t be sick of it \u2013 and that should take you tens of hours at least, even if you\u2019re checking off all the major missions you come to.This is very probably the most flawless open world game ever made.As for the rest of it: wow. This is a supremely polished game, and very probably the most flawless open world game ever made. Every complaint I have about Horizon Zero Dawn is a trivial niggle (Aloy\u2019s hair behaves strangely in elevators, ambient dialogue is sometimes out of whack with story progress) or a criticism you could aim at pretty much the whole medium (swimming transitions are a chore, the uncanny valley is wide and deep).Performance on a standard PS4 was smooth and slick as a lawyer\u2019s grin, and glitches were so few and far between \u2013 even after playing for a whole day without reset \u2013 that they\u2019re just not worth cataloguing.Every design choice feels measured and makes sense in context, like the loot boxes that allow you to keep all your quest rewards even if your inventory is full, or the medicine bag motivating you to explore rather than fast travel so you can refill it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1119bb6c-b976-414e-ab37-95ec4314bf67": {"__data__": {"id_": "1119bb6c-b976-414e-ab37-95ec4314bf67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "39b44dcd-9465-403a-8d49-205e771bbd97", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e467fc5c1c62c4869f2f9c5ce94f370560b50caa0ba34a52408173be0cf34e5"}, "3": {"node_id": "858fb46f-df37-4285-b0df-0228573a064e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6cdb1d5cf77fbc0c5adddb50657911d2164c4235c22443ffa7e0353150f3caf"}}, "hash": "6e460aa677721bffca1ec3234ffb564e37d0a4ef167e510e4a76b7e023201fdb", "text": "Even the old standbys of open world gameplay have been treated with care and elevated above the pack. For starters, non-climbing sequence traversal is extremely forgiving, so you can hop your way up most mountains and slide down the other side if you take a wrong turn and don\u2019t want to go back around.Almost all side content is laid out in such a way that you can complete it as you advance through the main plot without huge amounts of backtracking (pro tip: don\u2019t go out of your way chasing icons until you\u2019ve checked in at the quest hub along the main story route). Most of it is worthwhile, because it\u2019s either fun and interesting in itself or rewarding in a material way, and even the collectibles are good - there are relatively few, none are stuck behind painful traversal barriers and you can buy collectible maps as soon as you finish the opening sequence.Oh, and Photo Mode is sensational. I don\u2019t know why every game boasting a large and good-looking world doesn\u2019t ship with a photo mode, but this one is feature-rich and easy to use. \n \nThere are only a few things I would gently suggest could use improvement for (the possible) Horizon 2 that don\u2019t also apply to all video games, ever. Load times after fast travel on a standard PS4 are appalling; it is generally quicker to hoof it. There should be more indication of the suggested order of main quests, which occasionally seem to deviate from the general geographical and difficulty flow in puzzling, immersion-disturbing ways. That\u2019s it.Horizon Zero Dawn is a meaty but player-friendly open world epic with a solid action combat heart, unique setting and ravishing scenery. It is The Witcher 3 of post-post-apocalyptic robo-dino adventures; it is the sort of thing Ubisoft will wish you had never seen if it dares to release another time-sucking, glitch-filled Assassin\u2019s Creed. It is the promise of open world games gloriously fulfilled.

Born on a lark as the \u201cmost risky\u201d concept from a Guerilla Games pitch session, the aesthetic of meshing tribal warfare with high-tech creatures is intriguing all on its own before one even picks up a DualShock remote.It\u2019s also a compelling reason why Guerilla should be working on new IP.Horizon Zero Dawn\u00a0(PS4 [reviewed with a Pro unit])Developer: Guerrilla GamesPublisher:\u00a0Sony Interactive EntertainmentReleased:\u00a0February 28, 2017MSRP: $59.99Horizon Zero Dawn\u2018s premise that man, in a tribal state, and machine, co-exist, sells itself. The promise of using a bow and arrow to hunt prey is something that\u2019s been working its way into a litany of games in the past several years, much less with a\u00a0metallurgy tint and lifeforms comprised of circuits and wires to resembling hulking beasts. But if you strip down the eye candy, Horizon\u00a0focuses on a hero\u2019s journey with a young woman at the center.The name Aloy (pronounced \u201cAle-oy\u201d) is slightly cringe-worthy, but she\u2019s captivating enough to hold up the narrative, and formidable enough to hold my interest during some of the action sequences. I\u2019ve always liked Ashly Burch\u2019s work (particularly in the anime arena, she kills in Steins;Gate), and she succeeds in giving Aloy a little bit more spark than the average voice actor. We even get bonus Lance Reddick, who yells at Aloy almost with the same fervor as when he yelled at that asshole McNulty.But beyond those two, the rest of the cast falters. Not only do they sport bland designs, but they really don\u2019t have a whole lot of interesting things to say, even when you exhaust all of the choices on the occasional dialogue wheel. A rote \u201cAloy grows up\u201d intro and tutorial drive the point home that from a narrative sense, you aren\u2019t going to get anything you haven\u2019t seen before.It does get better though. The more you roam around the open world, the more captivating this realm gets, especially if you care to fill in the bits and pieces from some optional sidequests. The main source of entertainment? Killing robots indiscriminately in all sorts of ways. Yes you have a bow, sling, rope gun, traps, and all sorts of gadgets (with elemental flair), but you can get even more creative than that. You know that part in Return of the Jedi\u00a0where the Ewoks roll logs onto an AT-ST? It\u2019s like that. In fact, the entire game is kind of like that scene, but with humans instead of Ewoks.What makes it fun is that the machines are formidable. Several of them are huge, resembling Japanese style Zoids or Metal Gear robots, and they make for some great open world candid boss battles beyond the scripted critical path ones from the story. The real draw is how open the combat system is, given that there are so many effective ways to approach a situation.For instance, players can utilize different types of AI to take advantage of weaker pack animals, by routing them into a Home Alone-esque funhouse full of explosions and debilitating traps that cause paralysis. Or you can opt to use stealth to take them out one by one with critical kills before focusing on the pack leader. Alternatively, you can use your spear and dodge the old fashioned way.Even still, there\u2019s more options. By using a piece of tech Aloy acquires at the start, you can scan enemies (read: it\u2019s detective vision) to identify their weaknesses, and even track their movements with little on-screen footprints. Or, you can take over enemies entirely by re-writing their programming (starting with weaker foes first, sans upgrades), turning them against each other.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca18dc38-167b-49fd-b985-7056dd144f93": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca18dc38-167b-49fd-b985-7056dd144f93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "858fb46f-df37-4285-b0df-0228573a064e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6cdb1d5cf77fbc0c5adddb50657911d2164c4235c22443ffa7e0353150f3caf"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bcd6c7e-399d-4d1d-a49f-d97332ba7540", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e35c505a933ce3b54213e413323485b97ab6144c13375aa99fa96bed2436993"}}, "hash": "eae8cd2b9ed30821deff6c90ebc1fc42b7728065e76936c2a0f5d400554fef9c", "text": "Much of my playtime was spent exploring, identifying situations, and coming up with a plan to take them all out.It would be amazing if that\u2019s what the entire game is, but you have to take frequent interludes to fight human opponents and move the story along, which as you can expect, is often a drag. Here it turns into a typical third-person action shooter, as the AI really isn\u2019t as smart or adaptive as the machines. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s an overwhelming amount of these bits, but they are substantial, and humans are peppered into several of the cooler machine-oriented boss fights.Missions also frequently shift from open world roaming to Uncharted-like linear romps in underground locations. The platforming system is forgiving as it provides the player a large degree of control (you can\u2019t really fall unless you try, as Aloy will automatically grab or lock onto potential ledges), but as a result, it makes a lot of these sequences elementary, like you\u2019re just going through the paces. They\u2019re backed up by some killer lore fill-ins, sometimes of the much-loved audio tape variety and frequent story revelations, but altogether the platforming is a tad too safe.It\u2019s especially odd when juxtaposed to how heated combat gets, as machines tend to have large lifepools and dish out tons of damage. Although some might be turned off after being one-shot by a boss, I relished the chance to temper my skills and found the difficulty curve to be refreshing for an open world game. I never really had to specifically grind to beat anything, but the game does lightly push you towards sidequests as a means of leveling up (since, in a non-traditional manner, some missions grant you different stat bonuses than others).Usually you can judge an open world game based on how much it makes me want to keep chasing those shiny map icons, and Horizon Zero Dawn\u00a0is in the unique position in that it inspires me to just screw around. At no point did I feel like any arena challenges or bunker spelunking sidequests were droll, merely inoffensive filler, backed by a really strong core. On the way to an objective I\u2019d get lost on purpose trying to craft an upgrade or find a rare material, only to look at my watch and see that three hours had passed.Which leads me to another big aspect of Horizon, crafting and gathering. You can make nearly every resource, ammo type, potion, and trap on your person, but it takes effort, and some will find it tedious. For extra capacity pouches for instance you\u2019ll need rare drops from animals (yes, critters are in too), like a piece of raccoon skin. But you can also loot another rare drop from them: raccoon bone. See what I\u2019m getting at?Lest you think corners were cut rushing an open world game out of the door, think again. The day and night cycle, which plays out even during multiple mission failures, is beautiful, as is the weather system. It\u2019s stunning with 4K and HDR support (on a Pro),and although the 30FPS cap does sting at times, it\u2019s mostly stable. Turning off the HUD and invoking the now Sony-standard camera mode also played a huge part in my decision to spend a lot of my time doing nothing in particular.\u00a0Horizon Zero Dawn is a fascinating premise wrapped in a tortilla of tropes. It has detective vision, radio towers, skill trees, masked load screens (Tony Hawk\u2019s American Wasteland gets no credit for popularizing this in 2005, by the way), and a world map littered with billions of points of interest \u2014 all stuff you\u2019ve seen before. But after you set up and execute a cunning plan to decimate a pack of giant robot crocodiles and that smile hits your face, it\u2019s more excusable.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GoodSolid and definitely has an audience.

But that\u2019s what Guerrilla Games has tried to do for Sony with Horizon Zero Dawn, and after playing the game for 30 hours, I\u2019m going to say they\u2019ve succeeded.Horizon Zero Dawn is a radical departure for Guerrilla, best known for the Killzone series, which has always been a PlayStation staple, but not exactly a stand-out entry in the overly-crowded shooter genre dominated by Call of Duty, Battlefield and the like. Switching to an open world title isn\u2019t exactly blazing some bold new path either at this point, as the genre is well-established and some would even say oversaturated at this point.In many ways, Horizon Zero Dawn can feel like a lot of what\u2019s come before. Its third person, bow-and-climbing focused gameplay certainly has echoes of the new Tomb Raider games. Its overall world and structure feels a lot like Far Cry Primal, only here most of the wildlife is robotic and terrifying.Therein lies the central \u201chook\u201d of Horizon (which is what the game should have been called, or \u201cZero Dawn,\u201d but not both). The game has topped many \u201cmost anticipated\u201d lists in 2017 thanks to its gorgeous visuals and frankly bizarre concept, tribal warriors hunting and fighting robot dinosaurs and animals in some far-flung future after our current world has been destroyed.You play as Aloy, the red-maned hunting goddess featured in all the trailers who seems destined to become an instant PlayStation icon alongside Nathan Drake and Kratos, which is surely what Sony was hoping for. Aloy and her adoptive guardian are outcasts, shunned by their people for unclear reasons, but the game opens with her trying to win a spot in the tribe during a process for the young called \u201cThe Proving.\u201d Aloy wants to not just complete the event, but win, which will allow her to ask the tribal elders for anything, and she wants to know who her mother was. If this sounds like the beginning to some kind of young adult novel, I can promise it doesn\u2019t stay that way for long.Photo: Guerrilla GamesAloy\u2019s journey to self-discovery turns out to be much more complicated than she envisions, and to find answers, she sets out across the entire countryside, far outside the borders of her tribal lands. There she discovers that the more she learns about herself and her own origins, the more she\u2019s able to uncover the mystery of what killed the world, and why there are uh, giant robot animals roaming around everywhere. She also has to deal with squabbles and wars between different human factions, and some of the more sinister ones are using \u201ccorrupted\u201d machines to do their bidding.I like Aloy. She\u2019s well-voiced by Ashly Burch, as she\u2019s tough, often compassionate and occasionally funny. There is no Lara Croft \u201cthe girl must become a woman\u201d arc here.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fcbc714-0573-4f99-bf7f-7d515e01da4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fcbc714-0573-4f99-bf7f-7d515e01da4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bcd6c7e-399d-4d1d-a49f-d97332ba7540", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e35c505a933ce3b54213e413323485b97ab6144c13375aa99fa96bed2436993"}, "3": {"node_id": "f99ebf0a-01fc-4224-a389-825d9fd55f47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "12e4ba7b3cbdb5014226551bf1276a2b6ca24c30f89ed5b03e0ed86b27ce3fba"}}, "hash": "c731ad0eefbae98e65adf1b91f20a05d06ee3270ed7a63b5e15efefd7f474e73", "text": "There is no Lara Croft \u201cthe girl must become a woman\u201d arc here. After a brief childhood training sequence, she\u2019s more or less a total badass for the duration of the game, and the more she does to combat the robot menace, the more everyone treats her as such.The beginning and the end of the game is where Aloy shines the most, first in her rather dispiriting role as a shunned outcast trying to prove herself, and her touching relationship with her surrogate father. Similarly, she\u2019s inspiring near the end when she\u2019s on track to be a world-saving warrior queen. The middle drags a bit however. While I appreciate what Horizon does with sidequests, giving each a little story, making sure none are clone-stamped or substance-free the way you seen in Far Cry or Assassin\u2019s Creed, I\u2019m not sure any of them are terribly memorable. Aloy lacks many meaningful relationships throughout the game, as supporting characters are only given a handful of lines or a sparse few missions with her. This solidifies by the end when she rallies all the allies she\u2019s helped against the machine menace, but during the game it can make the story, and Aloy herself, feel rather empty at times.I will say, however, that far and away, my favorite aspect of Horizon\u2019s story was the overall arc that explains what happened to the world and why Aloy is a key part of the equation. You may be able to connect some dots about the apocalypse based on the fact that every city lies in ruins and the world is full of giant robot monsters, but it goes much, much deeper than that. Without giving anything away, there is some really interesting science-fiction lore here, and it creates a story that you\u2019re genuinely curious to see explained. It\u2019s a \u201cchosen one\u201d narrative that actually makes a lot of sense when all is revealed, and while there may not be any mind-blowing plot twists, the story of the end of Old Earth and the beginning of this weird new era is surprisingly well thought-out, and it manages to be one of my favorite storylines I\u2019ve seen in this genre.Pushing past story, this is a game after all, and if Horizon failed mechanically, it wouldn\u2019t work at all. Fortunately, gameplay isn\u2019t an issue, and in many sequences, can be the kind of chaotic, epic experience that you\u2019ve likely seen in all the trailers.Photo: Guerrilla GamesThere are two main types of enemies that Aloy fights: humans, evil cultists and such, and the machines. Unfortunately, even though human opponents make up close to half of the number of combat sequences in the game, this is where things feel a bit dull. There\u2019s very, very little complexity to Aloy vs. human combat. You can one-hit stealth kill any enemy with only minor upgrades, and if you get into open combat, a heavy-critical hit combo is enough to take out almost any foe in two strikes. Or if that\u2019s still too complicated for you, you can just whip out your fire arrows, hit any enemy two or three times, and watch them melt instantly. There\u2019s just not that much to it.Fighting machines is the polar opposite. While you can sneak around and one shot some of the early machines, or whack them a few times with your spear for a kill, soon enough you will be running into bigger and badder creatures that will absolutely wipe the floor with you, if you\u2019re not careful. These sequences are where the game really comes to life, and where it differentiates itself from its competition.Aloy has access to a host of non-traditional weaponry that comes in handy during these difficult machine fights. She can set up traps with a gun that shoots tripwires, she can rope machines down to the ground and immobilize them, she can lob elemental grenades at them, and she has access to not one, but three different kinds of specialty bows that each have different ammo for different situations. Your regular bow can fire normal and fire arrows for instance, while your sniper bow can pierce armor and knock off plating with sonic arrows. Your \u201cwar bow\u201d is purely elemental, able to shock or freeze enemies, or with an upgraded version, able to \u201ccorrupt\u201d them and make machines turn on one another. Aloy also has the ability to manually hack machines to rally to her side, some she can ride like a horse, others she can override to simply unleash havoc on other machines or human enemies.In these battles, you really have to pay attention to tactics, elemental vulnerabilities, enemy weak spots, and so on.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f99ebf0a-01fc-4224-a389-825d9fd55f47": {"__data__": {"id_": "f99ebf0a-01fc-4224-a389-825d9fd55f47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fcbc714-0573-4f99-bf7f-7d515e01da4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c731ad0eefbae98e65adf1b91f20a05d06ee3270ed7a63b5e15efefd7f474e73"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b72be1b-0eb6-4686-9d9e-481a5f61efca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2cd95b725f595ca9c60465c0d0b9ecb9cf68534f8efd31ac6573f4fadb00ebfc"}}, "hash": "12e4ba7b3cbdb5014226551bf1276a2b6ca24c30f89ed5b03e0ed86b27ce3fba", "text": "If you just dodge roll and spear whack and shoot random arrows at these machines, you\u2019re going to get absolutely destroyed. But once you start paying attention to what works, that\u2019s where things get really interesting. Set up shock tripwires to trap and stun stampeding Behemoths. Freeze Thunderjaws solid and snipe at their heart plating to expose their vulnerable core. Shoot fire arrows at Glinthawks until they catch ablaze and come crashing down to earth so you can melee them. The combination of all these tactics, weapons and enemies create some really compelling combat encounters, much more so than you\u2019d usually expect from a game like this.Elsewhere, there are some issues that may remind you that this is Guerrilla\u2019s first open-world game. For some reason, they decided to make fast traveling based on a consumable item, which is really irritating in the early stages of the game. It was only through dumb luck that I discovered that eventually, NPC vendors will sell a permanent item that allows for infinite fast travel, because the game never told me that became available. Still, it would have been better to just have that from the start.Photo: Guerrilla GamesBy far, the worst mechanic in Horizon is its health system. There is no natural health regeneration, which could be fine, but the way you regain it is beyond irritating. You can craft and use a small collection of health potions, but your main way to manually recover life without using a consumable is to collect various \u201cmedicinal\u201d leaves from the wild that fill up a little bar of reserve medicine that you can use when you\u2019re low. The problem is that even with an upgrade that lets you scavenge better, you need four to six plants to fill up your medicine bar even once, and if you\u2019re seeking out combat in any form, you will often spend the next five minutes wandering around a random field collecting plants to try and refill that bar for your next encounter. Worse still, there are about five other types of plants in the wild, all with the same icon, so you can walk up to what you think is a health plant and it\u2019s some sort of anti-elemental plant used to craft a different potion. This entire system was a huge oversight, and it\u2019s a big time waster. Better to have two or three of these plants fill up your bar at most, or allow players the ability to regain health at campfires, or slowly over time. Any of those ideas would be better than the current set-up.One sort of weird quirk about the open world map that isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, but an odd decision, is that you can miss some very important places on the map if you\u2019re not paying attention. Aloy will get early quests to wipe out bandit camps, or enter dungeon-like Cauldrons which will allow her to hack different classes of machines. But after the initial ones, the rest appear only as faded icons on the map. You will never be tasked to go there unless you get within spitting distance of them, so if you\u2019re just going around doing easily visible quests, it\u2019s easy to miss them even though they\u2019re some of the best, most important pieces of content in the game. The same goes for random villages that you\u2019re never told to go to, but if you don\u2019t, you might miss a number of extensive sidequests. It\u2019s not on the level of Fallout where you have talk to every single NPC to make sure you don\u2019t miss a quest, but I can imagine many people getting close to the end of the game and realizing they\u2019ve missed four or five dungeons or big quests they were supposed to do 20 levels ago.Overall, I do like the structure of Horizon Zero Dawn. It\u2019s a meaty game. I sunk 30 hours into it, and that\u2019s without XP farming, collectible hunting or getting gold medals in hunting challenges. That was just doing all the quests and clearing all the camps and dungeons. The main story seems like it\u2019s going to end at a few different points, but just when you think it might all be over, there\u2019s usually another bigger, tougher quest on the horizon, culminating in a very satisfying finale, both from a gameplay and story perspective.I was impressed with Horizon from the outset, my interest lagged a bit in the middle, but by the end I was a convert. This is a very cool universe with a genuinely likable new lead. Gameplay is excellent in most sections, and it avoids some irritating open world tropes like overloading players with substance-free side missions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b72be1b-0eb6-4686-9d9e-481a5f61efca": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b72be1b-0eb6-4686-9d9e-481a5f61efca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f99ebf0a-01fc-4224-a389-825d9fd55f47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "12e4ba7b3cbdb5014226551bf1276a2b6ca24c30f89ed5b03e0ed86b27ce3fba"}, "3": {"node_id": "839ec3be-03b5-4a83-9384-59797bfc3360", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d01bcfa050cf7385fceacce70931775b4ddf79a4bb50602617fde810264d8a20"}}, "hash": "2cd95b725f595ca9c60465c0d0b9ecb9cf68534f8efd31ac6573f4fadb00ebfc", "text": "There are some problems that reflect Guerrilla being new to this genre, but ultimately the good far outweighs the bad. It is a slightly disappointing that in many ways, Horizon does feel like a lot of other open-world games rather than being some crazy breakout new experience, but there is enough here between its story and robo-monster hunting gameplay that makes it unique. If you\u2019re overloaded on open-world games, I don\u2019t blame you, but Horizon is one of the better entries in the crowded genre, and it\u2019s kind of cool to witness the birth of what\u2019s probably going to be a pretty key franchise for PlayStation in the coming years. No, Horizon probably isn\u2019t as monumental of an experience as playing Uncharted or God of War for the first time, but it\u2019s well-made, engaging and probably worth your time.Horizon Zero DawnPlatform: PlayStation 4Developer: Guerrilla GamesPublisher: Sony InteractiveReleased: February 28th, 2017Price: $59.99Score: 9/10A review copy was provided for the purposes of this review.Follow me\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0on Facebook.\nShacknews, New to Shacknews?

Our review.Horizon Zero Dawn is a remarkable achievement, but that may not seem readily apparent. A simple list of features or bullet points would easily be misunderstood as a ordinary open-world character action game, fine but forgettable. Its vaguely generic title doesn't do it any favors in this respect. However, Horizon is more than the sum of its parts. When each piece is this well-tuned and harmonious, it would be like dismissing a symphony as a collection of instruments.Take a broad overview of the moment-to-moment gameplay. It's a pastiche of various elements from other games, ranging from Tomb Raider's bow combat to the open world stealth of Metal Gear Solid 5 to the the deep crafting hooks of recent Far Cry. In moments, it actually felt very similar to the excellent Rise of the Tomb Raider, as my Aloy sneaked around an enemy camp, quietly picking off hostile enemies one by one.Horizon's combat adds an extra layer of preparation and planning atop that foundation. I was hardly ever successful charging into a bandit camp head-first, and only moderately so trying to sneak around unprepared. The enemies were consistently too numerous and too tough to take such a foolhardy approach. Instead, coming upon a combat encounter requires some degree of focus and careful planning. Aloy's ability to scan and mark enemies, to watch patterns and even track certain paths, made for a much deeper\u00a0experience. By employing a multitude of traps and gadgets, I always felt empowered to make a plan and execute on it.Battles against machines are even more strategic, but hectic in a way that requires a high degree of skill as well. Each type of machine has its own attack patterns, and weak points that are vulnerable to different types of weapons. While it's wise to spend a few minutes studying your target the first time you encounter a new robot, that will only get you so far. To really hold my own against a swarm of machines, I needed to make every shot count and quickly juggle different weapon types. It can feel frenzied, but always rewarding.\u00a0Those rewards also come literally, in the form of loot. This was pitched as an RPG of sorts, and while I'm not sure I quite understand stretching the term that far, Horizon does center itself around random drops and crafting. Materials can be used to make more traps or craft ammunition on the fly, while rarer materials are vital for trading. This being reminiscent of early civilization, trading isn't entirely handled with one universal currency system. Vendors accept shards as currency, but for better weapons and armor, they also require animal skins, fatty meats, or even particular robot components. Every battle comes with rewards, and the menu lets you easily set a task to find a specific item, feeding the loot loop.Machines frequently drop modifications for weapons and armor, giving passive stat boosts to certain types of damage, or to elemental resistances. Better equipment comes with more slots, and weapons, outfits, and mods come in the traditional green-blue-purple rarity varieties. It was slightly frustrating being unable to swap out mods without purchasing a fairly expensive high-level ability on the skill tree, since it meant I was either stuck with early mods or actively discouraged from equipping them until I could afford the higher-level skill.All of this takes place in a gorgeous open world, with environmental depth and a staggering amount of land to explore.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "839ec3be-03b5-4a83-9384-59797bfc3360": {"__data__": {"id_": "839ec3be-03b5-4a83-9384-59797bfc3360", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85f0a8e6-960f-4ef4-bfc7-874bb88c9076", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06ff2de15cbe79a5c9090f3edbc6ffb4affaa0024ceaa5ed8305693c5588a1e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b72be1b-0eb6-4686-9d9e-481a5f61efca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2cd95b725f595ca9c60465c0d0b9ecb9cf68534f8efd31ac6573f4fadb00ebfc"}, "3": {"node_id": "6abef11a-703b-45af-b419-abf324724ac6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "157ee68adcc341a0b5d7c6349add29b99ee5b2a069c813e1f072bc0f99df69ee"}}, "hash": "d01bcfa050cf7385fceacce70931775b4ddf79a4bb50602617fde810264d8a20", "text": "Even on my standard PlayStation 4, without the upgrades of the Pro, it looked absolutely fantastic throughout. I can't remember the last time an open world actually impressed me with a day-night cycle, but seeing the sun rise and set over these vistas was always something to behold. I was also\u00a0struck by the faces, which have eyes so believable and real it's almost haunting.\u00a0Exploring the world granted plenty of longevity and variety. While the puzzle-solving was trifling to the point that it could be entirely removable, the rest of the variety was nicely paced and easy to jump into. A typical session may involve running a quest or two, visiting the Hunting Grounds, searching for a loot drop, or finding my way to a new settlement. Every square inch\u00a0of this world is crafted and engaging.The other half of its posture as an RPG is the depth and attention paid to its story. Maybe more than any other single element, this is where Horizon\u00a0Zero Dawn excels. The premise is simple enough. A young outcast in a post-apocalyptic future sets out to learn about her own personal origin, and along the way discovers hidden truths about the world around her and the one that came before. Horizon makes no mystery of the fact that the world we know has collapsed\u2013we're referred to from the beginning as \"the Old Ones.\" But Aloy, the heroine, is much more concerned about her own life, and within that framework, Guerrilla weaves a rich tapestry.The world is vibrant and intimately detailed. Each culture has its own beliefs and traditions, and each character is a product of their upbringing. Aloy, as an outcast, is less faithful to the traditions of her Nora people, which gives her a skepticism when encountering their articles of faith. Many of the best plot points come from subverting our expectations, relying on our own understanding of the natural world and how it's incongruous with this religion. Nonetheless, it's easy to see how a religion would build around not repeating the mistakes of the Old Ones, and how that belief would lead to conflict with tribes less devoted to luddism.But more than cultural disagreements, Horizon often dives into the nature of interpersonal conflict as well. Each of a dozen or so major characters have strong, uncompromising perspectives. The dialogue comes from where most of the best dialogue does, when these personalities clash with equally valid points. I found myself frequently sympathizing and understanding where each participant was coming from, even during heated arguments.At the center of all this is Aloy, whose occasional dialogue prompts don't undermine her as a fully realized character. She's skeptical, determined, curious, and unabashedly willful. As her journey unfolded slowly, the central mysteries surrounding herself and what happened to the world are unwrapped in meticulous layers. I was constantly fed enough intriguing information to feel like I'd reached a significant step closer, but more questions kept lingering to the very end. That left me as curious to learn more as Aloy was, helping ground me in the narrative as an active participant.Ultimately, that's what Horizon Zero Dawn is about: scientific curiousity, compassion, faith, and humanity. It tackles heady issues with the subtlety of probing questions and character study, never forcing a trite message or lesson.When I began Horizon Zero Dawn, I was anxious it wouldn't be able to maintain itself for thirty-plus hours. I'm thrilled that fear was unfounded. The play was constantly rich and rewarding, and the mysteries constantly unfolding. I'm left not just feeling satisfied the entire time, but wanting more. This one is something special.This review is based on a PlayStation 4 download code\u00a0provided by the publisher.
