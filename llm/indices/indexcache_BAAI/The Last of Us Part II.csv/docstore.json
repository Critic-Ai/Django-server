impulses with the violent action so many of them depend on revolves around the character Nathan Drake. Star of the Uncharted series, Drake is famed for his easygoing, flippant charm - yet over the course of a single game he will typically kill hundreds of people. They call him the smiling psychopath.The joke must have stung the Californian Sony studio Naughty Dog, Uncharted's maker. In 2013 they started to grapple with its implications in The Last of Us, a moody post-apocalyptic thriller that upped the graphic brutality while seeking to frame it in the context of a desperate, cruel world, and also contrast it with the delicate bond developing between the protagonist, gruff smuggler Joel, and his cargo, a teen called Ellie.Now The Last of Us has a sequel, and in that sequel the wrestling match between the game's violent action and its thematic intentions has developed into a full-on, bareknuckle brawl. It is, perhaps for the first time in the history of big-budget action games, a fair match. It gets messy and problematic, and neither side comes out unscathed. But, by taking some big gambles, the developers land decisive blows that will send you reeling.This isn't even all that The Last of Us Part 2 is attempting. This is a game about women - not about the female experience per se, but a game in which almost all the notable characters are women and in which they are not only shown exhibiting great capability and physical prowess, but also contending with dark impulses typically ascribed to men: trauma, obsession, rage and revenge. It is also a game featuring LGBTQ+ relationships and characters in a prominent but matter-of-fact way - it's not a big deal, they are just there.And it is doing all this, remember, while remaining very much a crowd-pleasing action spectacular in the Naughty Dog mould, with thrills and spills and scares, beauty and ruin and high adventure. It is a lot. Too much, really, and it is no surprise that this game gets away from its creators at times. (Yes, even the famously controlling Naughty Dog.) Not all of it works. Sometimes the tone veers into a depressing, distasteful nihilism. The characters' motivations don't always stack up. The cast is overstuffed and the subplots are often over- or undercooked. Some of its points are made with an almost laughable bluntness as it hurries on to its next big idea. At other times, it operates with rare subtlety and understatement. You will be halfway through the game before you understand what it's actually doing and more than that before you really begin to feel its dread pull. Towards the very end, it is devastating.It's a very hard game to discuss without spoilers. I won't share any specifics, but if you want to go in completely cold, it might be wise to stop reading.The action is set four years after the events of The Last of Us, with intermittent flashbacks that fill us in on how the characters got from there to here. Joel and Ellie have settled in the self-sufficient community of Jackson, Wyoming. The awkwardness between them after Joel's fateful actions at the end of the previous game seems to have widened into a rift. Ellie, less precocious and more defensive and spiky as a young adult, is on the verge of a relationship with a woman called Dina. In the aftermath of a snowstorm, something happens that sees Ellie and Dina set off for Seattle with revenge on their minds.Seattle, where we spend the majority of the game's runtime, is in bad shape. It's in total ruins, partly flooded, and initially seems deserted but for pockets of infected, the grotesque fungal zombies that have brought society down. In fact, there's a turf war raging here between two factions of survivors. The Washington Liberation Front, or Wolves, are a paramilitary organisation - a more warlike version of the first game's Fireflies - that assumed control of the city from the government after a brutal uprising. They have a darkly charismatic leader called Isaac (a cameo by the magnetic actor Jeffrey Wright), and once we learn more about them, they paint a strikingly different picture of post-outbreak survivalism than the frontiersman stylings of the Jacksonites. The Seraphites, or Scars, are less well drawn, a cut-and-paste post-apocalytpic spooky cult that is never given a plausible reason for existing.On the warpath, Ellie inserts herself into this struggle and starts causing all sorts of havoc - but only after a lovely lull.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a19f4e85-509e-4139-a198-49f512d1099f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a19f4e85-509e-4139-a198-49f512d1099f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9926a5f-3d8e-49f8-bb43-edf304359473", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5583557551e81c4f133f80f1565675e22f3fd4c80326abbf86ee5ea8ae5d03f5"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4df0047-9934-4f8f-856a-0f574fc27c84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "befe40012de5ddcc55077db061c9e8c761ec5c1022a6d1bd1eb4ec2f96d6ba96"}}, "hash": "9fc68cc790b9ff3152cd771ec79b6d4c2485b90744a41c3546d78b2800dedf83", "text": "When she and Dina first arrive in Seattle, the game's remorseless linear momentum is briefly broken for a pocket of open-world exploration of the ruined downtown district (an evolution of a similar episode in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy). It's a wonderfully atmospheric scene-setter. After this, we're back on Naughty Dog's beaten path for the rest of the game, although the environments are roomy and complex enough to allow for satisfying close exploration as you scavenge for supplies, as well as affording a great deal of flexibility when it comes to combat encounters.It's during combat that you're most aware that you're playing a sequel from one of the world's most fastidious developers (albeit one that has seldom been known for the refinement of its gameplay mechanics). The careful iteration and professionalism of the design team are very evident. It retains The Last of Us' lean, muscular set-up, in which scarcity of ammo and supplies constantly forces you to experiment. Some of the rougher edges have been knocked off, but not so many as to eradicate its essentially scrappy nature - panicky, desperate scrapes and unintended messy bloodbaths are very much part of the vibe.So is stealth, which thanks to some mechanical lifts from Uncharted 4 and the addition of a prone stance is much more viable and satisfying to play; this is now a pretty well-sorted stealth game in its own right. Like any game in which death comes quickly, it can still frustrate, but a very clever smart autosave system keeps good pace with your progress and means you'll seldom need to restart a whole encounter. (The whole game experience is unbelievably slick and seamless, even by Naughty Dog's standards.) My chief complaint is that you spend more time battling humans than infected, and they're actually the less interesting - as well as less scary - combatants to face.The violence is extremely graphic, uncomfortably so. It's full of ugly flourishes, like the splattering sound of shotgun pellets ripping apart flesh, or the vicious flick that Ellie uses to slice open a neck as she performs a stealth kill. It can be sickening. Intentionally so? Surely. But I still can't help but detect a sour, grubby note of gratification to it, particularly in the repetitive context of the combat. Sometimes it breaks your connection to Ellie in a way that doesn't serve the game. Sometimes, in cutscenes, it's just taken too far, more than is needed to leave an impact or make a point.This is one reason why I initially suspected The Last of Us Part 2 of being too caught up in its own grim attitude, of just being highly polished misery porn. Another is that, with its attention divided between so many ambitious gambits, with an expanding cast of characters and with most of the action taking place over a matter of days, it doesn't have the first game's gentle but constant emotional core - that delicious slow thawing between Ellie and Joel, melting into love as you journey with them over the course of a year. (Ellie and Dina's romance might have been that, but it doesn't get the necessary screen time - admittedly for good reasons.) Without that warmth, that heart, it seems a bitter world to spend time in.I'm happy to report that my first impressions were wrong. Unfortunately, I can't and shouldn't fully explain why. I'll limit myself to this: Druckmann and his team have a grand plan that rests on a radical structure for the game which isn't initially apparent. Once you finally understand it, it's still a slow burn, as the writers' delicate character-building - the dialogue is wonderfully understated and naturalistic - needs time to do its work. So it isn't until the game's final stretches that it gathers its true power, as you approach a point that is all the more horrifying for its total inevitability.It's a huge roll of the dice from the developers, but it works, and the pay-off is almost indescribable. It would be too much to claim that you will never feel the same about video game violence again, but the shock is profound and discomfiting. It's gut-wrenching stuff. There's more to come as the game approaches an ending that is just as affecting and emotionally complex as its predecessor's, if not, perhaps, as ambiguous.The thing that really struck me - and pleasantly surprised me, coming as it does from a developer so transparently in love with the language of cinema - is that The Last of Us Part 2's power is wholly unique to it being a video game. There is a special kind of empathy that develops between a player and a game protagonist that no other medium can reproduce.

It's the last thing I've been thinking about as I've gone to bed, and the first thing that enters my head when I wake up. I've relived entire sequences in my mind, marvelling at their exquisite design, and wondering what I could have done differently. Its many, many unforgettable cutscenes are burned into my brain as though they were real memories, so evocative in their fierce, emotional resonance that they now hold a regular presence in most of my dreams, not to mention my nightmares.I've spent hours just trying to process everything I've played, coming to terms with its densely packed story, and discovering new avenues of appreciation for its craft. What I'm trying to say is that The Last of Us Part 2 is exceptional, and quite possibly the best game I've played this generation.\u00a0As a heads up, this review is completely spoiler free, so I won't be discussing any plot details outside of what Naughty Dog has already shown so far.If 2013's The Last of Us was a road trip turned twisted coming of age story, The Last of Us Part 2 is its revenge western companion piece. Set five years after the events of her pan-American odyssey with Joel, an indescribably traumatic opening episode leaves Ellie hellbent on a crusade to hunt down those responsible for a seemingly unforgivable crime. This pursuit takes our teenage heroine away from the rural pastures of Jackson County and deep into the urban overgrowth of Seattle, a city that experienced a very different kind of societal breakdown to The Last of Us' Boston, and thus poses its own unique threats to Ellie's survival.\u00a0I won't divulge any more details beyond that, but suffice to say that what starts out as a fairly straightforward tale of retribution morphs into something far more complex, surprising, and sinister. As with the original game, Naughty Dog cunningly exploits the interactivity of its medium with masterful assuredness, forcing players to take a cold, hard look at every action they make as Ellie, with all the discomfort and distress that entails.\u00a0The resulting 25 hour campaign is as full of controller-dropping 'holy crap' moments as it is the quiet, contemplative scenes of immense poignancy that the studio is known for, many of which are enough to leave a lump in the throat, if not render you a bawling wreck on the couch. As a contemplation of the thin line between justice and vengeance, and an uncomfortable plunge into the darker shades of the human psyche, The Last of Us Part 2 is unforgiving in its depiction of violence, nihilism, and the nebulousness of morality in a world without laws.\u00a0At the heart of it all, however, is Ellie, once again textured with incredible warmth and humanity by Ashley Johnson, in the kind of performance that we'll still be talking about years from now. The complexity of suffering is no easy thing to depict on screen, but Johnson's ownership of Ellie's character throughout it all is nothing short of awards worthy, aided seamlessly by Naughty Dog's cutting edge facial animation technology, which lets even the slightest change in body language speak a thousand words.\u00a0Ellie is surrounded by an equally compelling cast of characters, too, with new additions like Shannon Woodward's Dina, Stephen Chang's Jesse, and many others quickly proving themselves to be as well-rounded and multi-dimensional as the game's returning cast of familiar faces.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4416018-71a6-4084-9446-a162f6f703c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4416018-71a6-4084-9446-a162f6f703c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d99a91f-75f5-4412-9baa-f3c21cabcc9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "25618dc6de62629fdf0bf66c73a944d8c3b32ad3c578741ecbff769ac230b399"}, "3": {"node_id": "01eb9d79-ed0e-4898-a3d7-e20af97acbeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "be8472c247d9502ef289f343bf42e47586e69a2d67d4983666f8c271c2a49a8a"}}, "hash": "fd7c9500c5c9a46bca131f6af4698d60976bff21d18c5b3882e6de6972231073", "text": "Speaking of, Troy Baker steals some of Part 2's best scenes as Joel, showing us new sides to the character that enriches and complicates the relationship we developed with him over the course of the first game. If you thought The Last of Us' giraffe scene was a tear jerker, boy does this sequel have some treasures for you.\u00a0The Last of Us Part 2's story is one of great scale and intricate nuance, then, and the same can be said for its world. Naughty Dog has stretched the parameters of its linear game design to create environments that always feel like part of something larger than you are, yet are still crammed to the gills with the kind of handmade detail typically only reserved for more compactly structured single-player experiences.\u00a0The Last of Us Part 2 has more accessibility options than any other Naughty Dog gameYou can spend hours poring over the digital seams of every building, forest, and cavern, not just out of a desire to scavenge as much craftable scrap material as Ellie can carry, but to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the bespoke minutiae of Naughty Dog's handiwork. Every place has a story, offering a window into both the world that Ellie never knew, and the one she's all too familiar with, all told authentically through deftly placed artefacts, heuristic clues, and cleverly devised organic moments that bring each space to life.\u00a0Naughty Dog's environmental design still gently guides you along the critical path even with all that added emphasis on exploration, though, and never in a way that feels forced, or draws you out of the illusion. The sense of pace and flow that underscores each level as a result is impeccable, each mission resembling a playable tapestry that builds and crescendos at a tempo that always feels unpredictable and compelling.\u00a0It helps that Ellie is now able to navigate terrain far more competently than Joel ever could, smashing windows, abseiling off walls, and jumping from precarious heights to enter previously unreachable areas, allowing Naughty Dog to challenge players with more diverse environmental puzzles that enrich combat and exploration. These new gameplay mechanics are hardly novel ideas to the video game discipline, but they're deployed in The Last of Us Part 2 with the same level of care and dexterity as every other, all working in tandem to conjure a distinct sense of place anchored in that patented Naughty Dog approach to authenticity.\u00a0It should go without saying, of course, that The Last of Us Part 2 is the PlayStation studio's best looking title yet, and quite possibly the most visually impressive game we've seen on the PS4 to date. When sunlight flickers through the fern flanked forests rustling gently against the breeze, or the Seattle skyline burns red in the ambient hues of dusk, it's a thing of abject beauty, and you'll have no choice but to make use of Last of Us Part 2's helpful in-game photo mode.The Last of Us' guerilla style combat, too, has similarly been sophisticated to heighten the breakneck, jittery tension that permeates every skirmish. That's largely thanks to some of the most advanced enemy AI you'll ever have the (mis)fortune of brushing up against, who - like everything else in The Last of Us Part 2 - look and act disturbingly lifelike.\u00a0Adversaries call each other out by name, adopt revised strategies in reaction to your behaviour, and deploy new tools such as hunting dogs to sniff Ellie out from cover. Thankfully, Ellie can more easily float between stealth and open combat than Joel, able to use decade's worth of post-apocalyptic overgrowth as natural cover, or manoeuvre between small gaps to evade enemies and get the drop on others.\u00a0When you are caught out, and you almost certainly will be, fights descend into a messy trade of gunfire, explosives, and physical blows. It's here where things get extra stressful, particularly when the combat enters close quarters, and The Last of Us' nauseating depiction of raw violence refuses to let you inure to the full weight of your actions, the agonising screams and jugular death rattles of your victims haunting your memory long after you've killed them.\u00a0The next evolution of The Last of Us' infected, meanwhile, are more terrifying than ever before. The now iconic throat percussion of Clickers may still be enough to send a shiver down your spine whenever they fall within earshot, but just wait till you hear the guttural moans of Part 2's walking toxin bombs, the Shamblers, or find yourself backed into a dark room with\u2026 well, I'll let you discover the rest for yourself.\u00a0Naughty Dog leans unexpectedly hard into the horror side of its survival horror subject matter, amplifying the fear factor in ways that surprise, impress, and spook in equal measure, likely to leave even the most habituated gore hounds with their hands shaking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01eb9d79-ed0e-4898-a3d7-e20af97acbeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "01eb9d79-ed0e-4898-a3d7-e20af97acbeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4416018-71a6-4084-9446-a162f6f703c7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd7c9500c5c9a46bca131f6af4698d60976bff21d18c5b3882e6de6972231073"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6b4ee64-e041-4e17-879c-4fd541efff6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "38ab3976c231ce753b795cb7ad2b42cb5cc38bf6c5c3f3bf6b3f96815e9a5ffa"}}, "hash": "be8472c247d9502ef289f343bf42e47586e69a2d67d4983666f8c271c2a49a8a", "text": "Thankfully, Ellie has plenty of choices at her disposal to stay two steps ahead of her aggressors. New craftable tools, from explosive arrows to trip mines, embellish the improvised warfare with more opportunities for collateral damage, while the addition of skill trees - unlocked via Supplements and Hobbyist Magazines found across Seattle - offer players yet more agency in making those tough calls about where to best spend resources.\u00a0\"Not only justifies its existence as a sequel most didn't think was necessary, but stands confidently apart as an entirely different beast.\"Weapon workbenches are also back, rendered in insanely fastidious detail, and Part 2 expands The Last of Us' returning arsenal of firearms with a number of surprising new additions that I won't spoil here. That said, all boast the mechanical rigour you'd expect from Naughty Dog's tactile gunplay, always feeling impactful when a shot lands but never reliable enough to get you from point A to B through sheer force alone. \u00a0All of these systems and mechanics operate together seamlessly in The Last of Us Part 2 like gears in a clock bound by a distinct, singular vision, conjuring up an experience that never feels anything less than an exemplary feat of impeccable game design. \u00a0If there's perhaps one area where The Last of Us Part 2 can be faulted, it's for occasionally getting lost amidst the reeds of its own ambition. Like that of Uncharted 4, the scale of Naughty Dog's plot can fall into the habit of overwriting itself, losing its momentum out of a need to tie up every story thread or emphasise a thematic point that had already been made hours ago.\u00a0That deviation from its narrative focal point is rare at best, and doesn't undercut the impact of what is otherwise an incredibly powerful cautionary fable, but the game's layered, prestige television-style structure is excessive to the point of exhaustive at times. Relatedly, if the ending of The Last of Us was controversial for all the right reasons, Part 2's doesn't quite land with as much subversive tact, though does nothing to undo the resonance of the journey leading up to its final scene.\u00a0But no masterpiece is perfect, and The Last of Us Part 2 is absolutely a masterpiece, have no doubt. There is so much more about this game that I'm desperate to sing its praises for, but simply can't without spoiling anything beyond what's already been shown. Daring, uncompromising, and unlike anything I've played in a long, long time, Naughty Dog has created its most progressive interactive adventure yet.\u00a0The Last of Us Part 2 not only justifies its existence as a sequel most didn't think was necessary, supplementing and elevating the timeless qualities of its predecessor, but stands confidently apart as an entirely different beast, one bearing its own fangs that bite with just as much force. The lasting achievement is nothing short of extraordinary, and a game we'll be looking back on for decades to come.\u00a0I'm GamesRadar's Features Writer, which makes me responsible for gracing the internet with as many of my words as possible, including reviews, previews, interviews, and more.

But The Last Of Us isn\u2019t about plot, it\u2019s about characters, and the question of who Ellie is and what her motivations are is far more important than any background lore.Of course, if you\u2019ve played the first game you\u2019ll know exactly who Ellie is: the only person known to be immune to the \u2018infected\u2019, which in the first game made her of vital interest to an ostensibly benign militia group called the Fireflies. Suffice to say though, that things did not go to plan for them and the infected plague was not cured. As such, the sequel starts five years later, when Ellie and her surrogate father Joel are living as part of a particularly well-equipped community in Wyoming.As developer Naughty Dog threatened when the game was first announced, the primary themes here are hate and the cycle of violence. And while that doesn\u2019t manifest in quite the way you might be imagining it certainly does illustrate how Ellie\u2019s love for Joel, and new girlfriend Dina, is perverted into a wholly destructive force, that turns her from the spunky teenager of the original game into a hate-filled monster with zero empathy for anyone but her small circle of friends.Some fans already seem to have taken this as a betrayal of the character, but the game illustrates very well not just how her change in attitude happened but how it was almost inevitable given how poor a father figure Joel is. The Last Of Us Part 2 is a story about selfish, insensate people doing terrible things, but the motivations of everyone is not only clear but relatively understandable.As in any Naughty Dog game, the dialogue and voice-acting is superb, but what\u2019s most interesting is the way the game humanises your opponents and how your sympathies gradually shift from Ellie to her victims. The game enables you to spend significant amounts of time with Ellie\u2019s prime targets, allowing you to get to know and understand them; at least enough to see them as real people rather than just objectives or end of level bosses.Ellie sees none of this though and kills without hesitation or mercy. But you, as the player, understand who these people are and why they did what they did. More than once you, as Ellie, are forced to kill someone you know does not deserve it and those moments are extremely disturbing, as if you\u2019re being coerced into a crime you want no part of. Not since Kratos in the original God Of War trilogy have we disliked a player character so much and given the considerably more realistic tone of The Last Of Us, Ellie\u2019s descent is far more harrowing.It\u2019s all the more so because Ellie is so hypocritical about the whole situation, regularly admonishing others for their violence and immorality. This is particularly true of a new militia group she comes into conflict with, as she at one point describes them as \u2018not like us\u2019 \u2013 implying that Ellie and her group have a moral superiority that she certainly never demonstrates.The Last Of Us Part 2 has some of the best storytelling video games have ever seen, not simply for the quality of its presentation but the fact that it has something important to say. If you\u2019ve ever watched a movie, or played a game, and cheered on the murder of faceless cannon fodder, Ellie\u2019s actions will make you think twice about doing so again.This is a game about empathy, from both sides of the TV screen; Ellie\u2019s lack of it and your growing frustration with her and the lives she is destroying without ever even trying to understand. The game also neatly sidesteps one of the great limitations of storytelling in an action game, by answering the question of how you can have an anti-violence narrative and at the same time gameplay that makes killing fun. Although having a protagonist that is clearly in the wrong, and who you resent more and more the further you get, is obviously not a solution for every game.And yet the experience can be frustrating for those that expect to have as much control over the story as the action, even though that\u2019s never been Naughty Dog\u2019s style.

The story has to play out the way Naughty Dog say and you have no more control over it than if it was a movie, which at certain points \u2013 especially some self-indulgently long flashback sequences \u2013 it almost seems as if it should have been.When you\u2019re forced to carry out Ellie\u2019s actions in a pivotal encounter, by pressing the attack button, you\u2019re learning a little about your own morality, but mostly you\u2019re just acting as a puppet for the game\u2019s director. Except when the game takes over completely in a cut scene and any illusion that the story is being told through you, rather than at you, evaporates. That\u2019s an issue the ending of the first game shared and yet, once again, the narrative is strong enough that the lack of interactivity doesn\u2019t leave you feeling as detached from events as it might have.But while Naughty Dog\u2019s storytelling is a stylistic choice there are still flaws in the execution, the most serious being the fact that the game is simply too long. It\u2019s twice that of the original, and while there is a good reason for that there\u2019s still a similar flabbiness about the mid-section, with a lot of what amounts to filler in terms of both story and combat encounters.You\u2019ll notice we haven\u2019t mentioned the gameplay yet and that\u2019s for the simple reason that it\u2019s nowhere near as interesting, or innovative, as the narrative. It\u2019s still perfectly entertaining but at this point the simplistic stealth mechanics feel very overfamiliar and bordering on old-fashioned.There are a dozen or more other stealth games, from Metal Gear to Batman: Arkham, that offer both deeper stealth mechanics and a considerably greater range of other gameplay elements. All there is to The Last Of Us Part 2 is stealth and equally simplistic combat (melee fighting is just one punch and a dodge).There\u2019s also some light platforming and the occasional puzzle, but the majority of the latter involves either throwing ropes or moving giant wheelie bins and although a few are quite interesting in their use of physics they become increasingly rare as the story goes on.None of this should suggest that The Last Of Us Part 2 is in anyway bad in terms of its gameplay, as apart from the finicky item and weapon selection the combat is just as polished as the rest of the game, but the difference in ambition and complexity between the storytelling and gameplay is significant.Despite being a much bigger focus, the stealth is barely any more complex than Uncharted 4 and you can\u2019t even do basic things like move dead bodies. And while there is a range of unlockable skills and craftable traps and throwables they\u2019re rarely necessary on the default difficulty.If The Last Of Us was just a straight action game with a generic story then it would be quickly dismissed as shallow and repetitive. Although it would still be lauded for its astonishingly good graphics. The facial animation is the best console games have ever seen and so too is the foliage, both of which we\u2019re sure will not be equalled by most next gen games at launch. Although the most enticing preview of what the PlayStation 5 may bring is the ultra-quick load times when you die, which are hugely appreciated.The transition between animations can be a bit clumsy at times, and we encountered a few seconds of slowdown here and there, but the only real technical failing is the amount of noise the game causes the console\u2019s fans to produce. The use of music is excellent but large sections of the game are supposed to be completely quiet in terms of the soundtrack, and yet the atmosphere is ruined when the PS4 Pro is growling away as if it\u2019s getting ready to detonate.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader\u2019s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNot for the first time, you wish that Naughty Dog cared as much about gameplay innovation as it does about pushing the boundaries of narrative but The Last Of Us Part 2\u2019s story is powerful enough that it lifts the whole experience; much as was the case with the original. The story is not just well told but meaningful and universally relevant. Not so much in terms of the revenge plot but how easy it is to dehumanise anyone you disagree with and to assume everything you do is right and anything they do is wrong.Throughout the game, Ellie\u2019s motivation is love and yet the trail of death and destruction she leaves in her wake breeds nothing but hate and violence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce71db45-ade4-494c-ab12-f2d54d9f54f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce71db45-ade4-494c-ab12-f2d54d9f54f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "986c71a8-08af-4c5a-8179-8d4b1781b3e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "556feeb1a5ce98ededb945b0be4aa8ab897f7f0c738495cbe2cce604fd1a13b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "53efe8a7-afbc-4dea-a380-b0741d199a1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5504d4ffb8defdcb04e3d4838208431ab1cb56d5f7056931d3fe1571076645ce"}}, "hash": "ab470584dd79c9a5cfa9a0077c8fdf993a177365418072ff720ddced8838a1eb", "text": "These are heady concepts for an action video game, or any kind of popular entertainment, and while The Last Of Us Part 2 is not a perfect experience it is an absolutely essential one.In Short: A milestone in action video game storytelling and while the gameplay is not nearly as inspired, the experience as a whole is one of the best of the generation.Pros: The script and voice-acting is superb, but more importantly the story has purpose and something genuinely profound to say about action entertainment.

We see what we want to see. We acquire our beliefs and perspectives from the people and the world around us. And sometimes, in order to see, we must be shown.The Last of Us Part II illuminates many complicated and difficult facets of humanity \u2013 a journey that tackles empathy, anger, and how we are defined by those around us. These philosophical considerations can be uncomfortable to wrestle with, but Naughty Dog conveys them with careful nuance and unflinching emotion, creating a narrative masterpiece with a unique power few games have ever achieved.The story opens with a conversation about how the first game ended \u2013 about what Joel did at the Firefly hospital, and the lie he told Ellie about it. That exchange lays the foundation for the current state of their complicated relationship, which players come to understand even more deeply as the story continues. Holed up in an encampment in Jackson, Wyoming, Ellie and Joel are trying to come to terms with the consequences of their previous actions, and the world continues to suffer from the chaos of the infection that has transformed mankind and ravaged civilization.The Last of Us Part II is defined by its story at every turn, and Naughty Dog masterfully weaves its themes in at every level. It depicts the raw violence that Ellie uses to navigate this harsh world, and that violence feeds into pivotal plot points during her quest for revenge. Yes, you kill many humans and Infected along the way, but the accumulated effect of Ellie\u2019s fury weighs on you over time. Even as you clear an area of hostile guards, you question your own role in the brutality. The people you assassinate have names, and you can overhear them talking about their loved ones as you sneak up on them. Though it\u2019s difficult to say that this is \u201cfun,\u201d the way The Last of Us Part II forges this level of investment and immersion is one of its greatest strengths.The chaotic, post-apocalyptic overlay creates the perfect opportunity for different factions to vie for power. In addition to the zombie-like Infected, you also fight the militarized WLF and the technology-averse Seraphites. You deal with all these groups in intense encounters that blend sneaking and shooting in varied and unpredictable ways. Ellie\u2019s increased agility lets you jump, crawl, and vault through areas and take advantage of verticality, but the biggest improvement to combat is the way the world pushes you to play. Stealth is always rewarded, and you can control the battlefield with clever use of your resources, especially in the larger environments. I knew I made a mistake when I died, and I felt satisfaction when I skillfully handled a situation.Even with its many combat scenarios, The Last of Us Part II offers tranquil and lonely moments. Some areas are devoid of encounters completely, but they don\u2019t feel barren. Instead, they focus on world-building, or cause you as a player to reflect on your actions.\u00a0The people you meet along the way also play an important part in your journey; when traveling alone, you feel their absence.Environments tell their own stories of those who became infected.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53efe8a7-afbc-4dea-a380-b0741d199a1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "53efe8a7-afbc-4dea-a380-b0741d199a1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce71db45-ade4-494c-ab12-f2d54d9f54f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab470584dd79c9a5cfa9a0077c8fdf993a177365418072ff720ddced8838a1eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c7715e7-b007-43fe-ba43-be61595d9f9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a77c9442cda81971c7e0c3fb30263574a685edf31030d3751fad227332464c78"}}, "hash": "5504d4ffb8defdcb04e3d4838208431ab1cb56d5f7056931d3fe1571076645ce", "text": "People waiting for their families to return, soldiers hunting deserters, and patients seeking treatment \u2013 you piece together these tragic and fascinating tales by reading notes and interpreting clues in the world.

Almost every corner has something to find, and I felt rewarded for\u00a0digging through drawers and searching every room. Going into an empty store, it was easy to feel for the characters in this world who had their lives upended. And as much as gaming can be an escape, the state of the real world right now provides a lens that is difficult to ignore; I never thought seeing the remains of a bookstore or a restaurant would hit harder due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but they did.The production values that Naughty Dog brings to this experience are second to none. The characters don\u2019t only look good \u2013 they look real, complete with quirks that make them more believable as humans. The world and its inhabitants are visually stunning, with artwork and animations you will see just once, quips and conversations that make the world feel alive, and a soundtrack and sound effects that brought chills to my spine. Low hums and water dripping on empty bottles add to the tension as you navigate the perils of the world.I can rave about the attention to detail, the world, and the combat, but the story is where The Last of Us Part II sets a new bar. It is more about challenging your heart than your reflexes, and I simply cannot recommend it enough. There is much to be said about this game that can\u2019t be said here due to spoilers, but you should play it as soon as you can with as little info as possible. But you don\u2019t need to know specifics to appreciate how the gameplay and environmental cues all play into a single purpose: They make you feel the choices, helplessness, and the violence at the heart of this world and its characters. I can safely say this is the best narrative game I have played. I felt the loss. I felt the confusion. It is a game that turned me inside out with each twist of the screw.For regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

If it weren't for the walls surrounding the town, you could almost forget that the world is crawling with infectious monsters that would kill everyone in sight; its main road, blanketed in snow, is a charming row of old buildings with decks for sidewalks, more Old West town than post-apocalypse settlement. Its residents grow food, care for horses, tend bars, and even have dances and movie nights. Four years after Joel saved (kidnapped?)

The game gave me stress nightmares, not because you kill a lot of people per se, but because playing as Ellie felt more like being dragged by my hair than being immersed in her mission. From the very beginning, I wanted to reach out and shake Ellie, as her proxy in all this, and get her to do anything other than what we were about to do. I knew her revenge quest was bad news before the killing and maiming really began.There are narrative reasons for that, though, and they do work. Being helpless as a player in the face of Ellie's destruction serves a grander purpose that I won't spoil here. The biggest issue is that the most impactful of her kills occur in cutscenes rather than in combat, and that obscures the purpose of combat's more upsetting aspects.The Last of Us Part II's combat is tense and exhilarating, though confronting in its brutality. Ellie is scrappy and agile, and moving through a combat arena is an art. Her movements are smooth enough that they almost look scripted; you can duck and dodge in a fight and deliver a return blow with a series of button presses that translate into a strangely graceful dance. You can accidentally alert an enemy to your presence only to slip through a tight space in the wall, vault through a window, and outrun your pursuer through a building to reestablish your cover and gain the upper hand. You can also easily get surrounded and die horribly, whether you're fighting people or infected.Navigating any given combat scenario is a puzzle in which you have to figure out exactly how to get from point A to point B with the resources you have. I'm partial to stealth when possible, and it's especially rewarding to decide how you're going to silently kill each enemy with only a flimsy silencer, two arrows, and your default knife. Should you kill the blind clickers first because they're strong and deadly, or should you kill the infected runners first because they can see you? Can you retrieve an arrow from a corpse to be reused on their friend? Most importantly, where's the exit?You can also find yourself going up against both humans and infected at the same time, and this is when combat is properly fun instead of just tense. By throwing a bottle, you can draw a clicker toward an enemy soldier and simply wait for them to kill each other. You can shoot glass above an enemy's head to send a runner or two straight to their location. You can simply take advantage of the chaos and start shooting indiscriminately. Regardless, it makes you feel clever and giddy and weirdly proud of yourself.Of course, that's if you numb yourself to the guttural screams of the man whose arm you just shot off or the awful gurgling sound of someone drowning in their own blood. Enemies use each other's names and aren't shy about crying out when they find their friend David or Rachel or whoever lying face-down in a pool of blood, suddenly dead from your silent knife takedown. Killing someone's dog is a priority, as they can track your scent and maul you to death, but you have to hear them mourn the dog in real-time. It helps--or maybe doesn't help--that the game runs flawlessly, even on a standard PS4, so there are no hiccups to dampen the viciousness.Ellie's movements are smooth enough that they almost look scripted; you can duck and dodge in a fight and deliver a return blow with a series of button presses that translate into a strangely graceful dance.All of that surely exists to make you feel bad about killing people and their dogs. But like I said above, the kills that actually matter in the broader scope of the story happen in cutscenes. Some are triggered by a button prompt or preceded by a brawl, but it's all very controlled; it's not like you're killing these important people in a regular combat scenario, realizing with horror later what you've done. These are the kills that end up hurting the most, and they're going to happen no matter what you do or what you think of all the violence. That's why they work so well for the story, but that also leaves the rest of the bloodshed rather unexamined.Frankly, the fact that your enemies have names doesn't make them any less in your way. You have to do what you have to do to get to the next location, and you want to do that to see where the story goes next.This disconnect between the video game-y aspects and the grander narrative is compounded by looting and collectible-hunting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d31fe61-88ae-4ee7-b9a3-9101292cdf1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d31fe61-88ae-4ee7-b9a3-9101292cdf1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c7715e7-b007-43fe-ba43-be61595d9f9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a77c9442cda81971c7e0c3fb30263574a685edf31030d3751fad227332464c78"}, "3": {"node_id": "566df85e-a163-4f43-876d-92d154789542", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "882f2818b59e3775c08de2d3fde17beb365de76c00dc545736918f5516d5f6f9"}}, "hash": "62e335d5faf05d297ff24eae416004a7ec1b10b7341360f8aa4ed67f50bf92ae", "text": "Looting during a fight is exciting, especially when you find the one extra bullet you need or a bit of health that can keep you going. But more often than not, I'd loot and look for collectibles only after I'd killed every enemy in the vicinity. It's far easier and safer, for one, and I didn't want to miss any of the interesting sub-plots found in scattered notes and photographs just because I wanted to kill fewer people.Finding collectibles and piecing together the stories held within them is rewarding and paints a picture of the outbreak as it developed through the years. A bank robbery gone wrong sticks out as a favorite, and there are quite a few other stories worth finding. A lot of the time, seeking out these collectibles will force you to get creative--things like breaking windows to bypass a locked door or swinging on a cable to get to an area that's just out of reach. There's nothing so difficult that you feel like a genius for figuring it out, but it does make you feel appropriately resourceful.Most of the time, there aren't any collectibles to find in combat-heavy areas. But there are still notes and things to find when enemies are around, and as a result, I ended up scouring every corner of every area in the hopes of finding something cool. Because most combat arenas give you multiple avenues of attack and escape, though, I ended up backtracking through most of them to try to find things, and that can severely disrupt the pacing. The nooks and crannies that work well in combat just become one more place to look for a note or trading card, and the fact that you're looking for trading cards at all often feels too game-y for the otherwise sobering tone.I ended up enabling an accessibility option called high-contrast mode to help with my collectible hunt. When toggled on, it mutes the background, removes textures, and highlights interactable objects and enemies. I used it after clearing an area of enemies to speed up the looting part, and while it wasn't the most elegant solution, it did help the pacing. It's one of a litany of accessibility options, too, which allow you to fine-tune the gameplay, sound, and visuals to your needs. It's a commendable suite that's incredibly inclusive.In the second half of the game, these exploration issues persist, as do the horrors of combat and violence. But for reasons I can't explain due to spoiler restrictions, the narrative shifts significantly at a certain point, and the context of everything you've done up until then changes along with it. There's a lot I want to say that I'm not allowed to until the game is out, but this half of the game is the reason anything in it works at all. It examines a lot of the violence that happens early on, though not all the violence in general, and it's where the story finds its meaning.There's a lot I want to say that I'm not allowed to until the game is out, but the second half of the game is the reason anything in it works at all.By the time I finished The Last of Us Part II, I wasn't sure if I liked it. It's a hard game to stomach, in part because so much of who Ellie is and what she does is beyond your control. She is deeply complicated and flawed, and her selfishness hurts a lot of people. At times, the pain you inflict feels so senseless that it can leave you numb. It's all messy and bleak and made me profoundly sad for myriad reasons, but the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core. I wanted almost none of it to happen the way it did, and that's what's both beautiful and devastating about it.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:Did you know murder is wrong? The Last of Us Part 2 depicts the future, yet it fails to escape its own past.The sequel feels like a time capsule from 2013, the year the first game was released in real life and the year of the fictional in-game zombie outbreak. The Last of Us Part 2 seems doomed to walk in a well-worn circle, unable to break out of the ever-thickening carapace forming along its skin, just like the victims of the Cordyceps fungus that you fight throughout the game. That is the game\u2019s central problem, and what makes so much of it such a challenge to get through: This is a story about characters who seem unable to learn or grow, and more specifically, unable to consider the humanity of the people they kill. If you already think violence isn\u2019t the answer to many of the world\u2019s problems, the repeated lesson that killing is bad makes the game almost maddening.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "566df85e-a163-4f43-876d-92d154789542": {"__data__": {"id_": "566df85e-a163-4f43-876d-92d154789542", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d31fe61-88ae-4ee7-b9a3-9101292cdf1e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "62e335d5faf05d297ff24eae416004a7ec1b10b7341360f8aa4ed67f50bf92ae"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8411468-04a3-4494-9bc1-7c125e3e52fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "25378235c37c1f1d172a1467242737fd499ffae0d6423c8ecb6d8c27cbedf647"}}, "hash": "882f2818b59e3775c08de2d3fde17beb365de76c00dc545736918f5516d5f6f9", "text": "I don\u2019t have any problem empathizing with the people who I\u2019m asked to kill in video games. The Last of Us Part 2 must think I\u2019ll struggle with it, though, since it doles out all sorts of reasons why I should feel regret about the murder spree its characters have embarked upon. But the game\u2019s larger problem is that the characters themselves don\u2019t ever seem able to catch up with me. What\u2019s worse is that the characterization of Ellie makes it seem like she should also understand this part of the journey. I kept expecting her to grow and turn away from a life of constant violence, but she never picks up on the obvious didactic nature of the game she\u2019s in, even as the designers beat you over the head with a very simple lesson about the value of human life.  Part 2 is a game about not rising above revenge or violent urges in general. It\u2019s filled with characters dedicated to never seeing the bigger picture beyond themselves. Although the game\u2019s backdrop is a global pandemic, and although it reaches toward the idea of larger injustices by depicting two warring human factions \u2014 the cult of the Seraphites, and the militaristic Washington Liberation Front \u2014 it is really just a story about a teen girl, her damage, and her apparent belief that the only way to get over that trauma is murder. A lot of murder. Part 2 opens as Joel, the gruff protagonist from The Last of Us, tells his brother his darkest secret, the secret that may have doomed humanity. After transporting a teenager named Ellie across the country, and learning along the way that she\u2019s likely the only person immune to the fungus, Joel is told that doctors will use her brain tissue to create a vaccine that will keep all living humans safe, but that the process will kill her. It\u2019s a fascinating moral conundrum: What is the value of one young girl measured against the whole of humanity?And so Joel murders everyone in the hospital, and saves the unconscious and unaware Ellie, with whom he\u2019s formed an unshakable, paternal bond \u2014 a bond that leads him to doom the rest of the planet by saving her life. When Ellie wakes up and asks what happened, Joel lies. The doctor just ran some pointless tests, he tells her. But, he says, there are plenty of other immune people at the hospital (there aren\u2019t), so maybe a vaccine could still happen someday (nope, not now). Ellie doesn\u2019t seem to believe him, but the credits roll regardless. Joel and the player are left with the unsettling knowledge that a lot of innocent people just died, and that more will fall victim to the fungus and the zombies it creates, all so that one very well-loved teen girl can live. Ellie didn\u2019t have a choice in that decision, and neither did the player. You have to go along with Joel on that one in order to get to the end of the game. It\u2019s a decision that robs the player and Ellie of agency, and the in-game world of a cure, and you better believe it has consequences that didn\u2019t end with the credits on the first game.Part 2 puts us into Ellie\u2019s shoes. Finally, she has the chance to make decisions for herself, and will perhaps even learn the truth about what happened at that hospital. That would present another interesting, challenging question for anyone: How do you live knowing that your life was bought by dooming the world? How do you have a healthy, mutually supportive relationship with the man who murdered innocent people just to save you? And is there a way to do so that doesn\u2019t involve going on your very own murder spree? That direction would force the creative team at Naughty Dog to rethink its own parameters, to go beyond the 2013 conceit of The Last of Us, which invited players to question Joel\u2019s motives but nonetheless forced them to enact those murders along with him if they hoped to see the end of the game. It\u2019s an outdated way to criticize the violence of games, and the complicity of those who play them. Remember 2013? That was the year after Hotline Miami came out, a game with themes that would also appear in its contemporaries \u2014 Spec Ops: The Line, BioShock Infinite, and The Last of Us. The Last of Us Part 2 even includes a Hotline Miami reference, so the writers were clearly aware of what they were doing here.  Those were all games that pushed you to feel bad about all the violence that your grizzled white-dude protagonist visited upon others, often for ill-defined reasons, even though the games themselves gave you no choice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8411468-04a3-4494-9bc1-7c125e3e52fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8411468-04a3-4494-9bc1-7c125e3e52fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "566df85e-a163-4f43-876d-92d154789542", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "882f2818b59e3775c08de2d3fde17beb365de76c00dc545736918f5516d5f6f9"}, "3": {"node_id": "ee245411-9070-4123-a373-3ec3313b1fc4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b0d58f08f4b6158532b4e5ce1af115f55f15b859e36a2879b7c6d088e5d93b9"}}, "hash": "25378235c37c1f1d172a1467242737fd499ffae0d6423c8ecb6d8c27cbedf647", "text": "Few games had questioned their own body count until that point, but suddenly, in the early 2010s, they were all reacting to the state of in-game stories in the same way: by forcing the player to do things, and then blaming them for doing that thing, even though the player had no other way to proceed.The Last of Us Part 2 gives us a grizzled-beyond-her-years white teen lesbian in the lead role, which is a refreshing change, but the conceit remains the same. Ellie can finally make her own decisions, but just like her dear old surrogate dad, she has a propensity for thinking in the short term and prioritizing her own more animalistic needs for revenge and relief from pain, no matter the human cost. And she\u2019ll be dragging the player along with her, because you have no damn choice but to get homicidal, no matter how much the game wags its finger in your face saying how bad you\u2019re being.  The game\u2019s new heroine may give the impression of some larger progressive message, but it\u2019s just a way to change the instruments, if you will. The song itself remains the same. The Last of Us Part 2 is the latest game that exists at the cross section of shaky moral ideas and an incredibly high level of craft. The sequel takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Seattle in the year 2038, long after the city\u2019s famous landmarks have crumbled into disrepair, their exteriors overgrown with lush greenery, their interiors crawling with monsters that hunger for human flesh. Meanwhile, various factions of survivors have cropped up, each of them scrapping and murdering one another for territory and resources. It\u2019s all presented to the player with incredible detail and lifelike animation, creating a visually believable vision of a very dire future in which nature is in control and humans are barely hanging on. Ellie traipses through sun-dappled forests, rides her horse over glittering streams, and explores moss-covered storefronts and sprawling suburban homes. She finds handwritten notes from humans desperate to scrawl something out before they succumb to their own infection, or get overrun by some warring human faction or the violent, infected monsters. She scribbles notes of her own in a journal as well, including lyrics for original songs she may someday set to music with the guitar she gets early in the game \u2014 a gift from Joel. The Last of Us Part 2 luxuriates in depicting the best parts of being alive in a way that\u2019s somewhat rare, even in games with this kind of budget and scope. The game depicts characters falling in love, discovering a well-hidden post-apocalyptic weed stash, and trying to come up with the worst possible puns. Ellie and her best friend (and crush) Dina live in the walled-off area of Jackson County, Wyoming, with a community of human survivors, along with Joel, his brother Tommy, and Dina\u2019s ex-boyfriend Jesse. They have something close to an actual, relatively safe home during a time when such a thing seems almost impossible, and one night they share a very public kiss during a barn dance attended by most of the community.  Things don\u2019t go well for them after that. That\u2019s because The Last of Us Part 2 also luxuriates in its depictions of pain, suffering, and death. An older man at the barn dance interrupts the girls\u2019 tender moment to spit at Dina, telling her that she\u2019s a \u201cloud-mouthed dyke,\u201d just like Ellie. Now, if Ellie lost her cool and attacked this guy, I\u2019d get it. She doesn\u2019t, however, so I\u2019m not sure what the moment actually accomplishes, other than to remind us that people are still homophobic after the apocalypse. Instead, outsiders to Ellie\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d are presented as the true danger, and her rampage against them is blood-curdling in its gruesomeness. The previews for the game have already shown some of the graphic violence in store; the one in which the Seraphites try to lynch one of the characters is a good example of the level on which Part 2 operates. It\u2019s going to show you the bad stuff, and it\u2019s going to rub your face in it.Some of Ellie\u2019s enemies have trained attack dogs, and it\u2019s hard to avoid killing them. Even if you do manage to avoid it, though, there\u2019s eventually a cutscene with a quick-time event that forces you to kill a dog, to hear the animal\u2019s sharp, confused yelp as you smash her skull in with a metal pipe.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee245411-9070-4123-a373-3ec3313b1fc4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee245411-9070-4123-a373-3ec3313b1fc4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8411468-04a3-4494-9bc1-7c125e3e52fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "25378235c37c1f1d172a1467242737fd499ffae0d6423c8ecb6d8c27cbedf647"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e420ac7-c6bb-424f-bca3-395e4d851644", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc8bbbc87cd013191841c6237a97e0c7453e3b56aa9675a92601c9adcd0d02b5"}}, "hash": "2b0d58f08f4b6158532b4e5ce1af115f55f15b859e36a2879b7c6d088e5d93b9", "text": "That wouldn\u2019t be enough suffering, however. Naughty Dog has to make sure you feel horrible, so you\u2019re later treated to a flashback in which you play fetch with that same dog, scritching her behind her velvety little ears. If Naughty Dog makes you feel bad enough, maybe next time you won\u2019t do ... the thing the game forces you to do?  The Last of Us Part 2 delivers these moments of emotional whiplash over and over again. If you ever feel good, victorious, or strong at any moment while playing this game, just know that you will later be feeling very, very bad, and it will happen very, very soon. This effect is mirrored in the game\u2019s combat design, which echoes the story\u2019s themes by repeatedly shoving you away from power, and toward fear, uncertainty, and weakness.  The combat in The Last of Us encouraged you to explore an area slowly, scrabbling for resources in abandoned buildings while staying hidden from potential threats. It was always better to attack enemies one at a time, whenever possible. Not much has changed in that respect, although the difficulty spikes are much smoother this time around, making the experience feel a lot less punishing, at least mechanically. Ellie is a tiny, terrifying gymnast; she\u2019ll leap from a hidden spot in the grass to slice open an enemy\u2019s throat or crowbar their head open, exuding all the cold precision of a lifelong killer. She\u2019s quick and methodical, covering ground in seconds if she has to by jumping, climbing, smashing through windows, squeezing through crevices, and pulling dumpsters up next to rooftops to better traverse less-than-hospitable areas. In houses and structures, she\u2019ll find small caches of ammo and resources that she can cobble together into health packs, trap mines, and so on. Ideally, planning will always beat passion, as there\u2019s little more satisfying than setting up a couple of trap mines, throwing a bottle at a horde of infected humans to incite their wrath, and letting them walk right into your death cave. A close second would be nailing a silent headshot with the bow and arrow, or perhaps just sneaking up on a series of clueless, shambling infected people and taking each one\u2019s wallet (that is to say, ammo or bandages) as you go down the line, chuckling all the way to the bank.Ellie\u2019s abilities strain at the seams whenever you alert a group of enemies to your presence, though, so it\u2019s best to avoid doing so. A petite teen girl like Ellie gets her most methodical murdering done by hiding in the shadows, taking on opponents in turn, as opposed to charging into the fray, guns blazing.  Still, Part 2 will sometimes railroad you into a battle with a bunch of opponents who\u2019ll come at you simultaneously, or it will throw a couple of big and formidable enemies your way that can\u2019t be beaten through stealth or cleverness. These moments look cool, since they\u2019re splashy set-pieces, but they almost never feel good to play. Not when compared to the moments in which Ellie can plan out her whole attack from the shadows and then unleash it like a trained, capable assassin.It\u2019s the rhythm of the game\u2019s narrative, and how it impacts your tactical choices, that keeps you from ever getting the upper hand. Part 2 includes several flashbacks, and the story is often told out of order, so the version of Ellie you\u2019re controlling may not have access to the weapons or abilities you\u2019re used to. This was annoying at first, but I\u2019d get the hang of whatever new weapons or items I could access within a few minutes. I learned, over time, never to get too comfortable with any of my setups or loadouts before the game took it all away from me. The designers always seemed to want to knock me back down a peg whenever the violence or combat began to feel too good. It makes sense conceptually. This isn\u2019t a world where things are yours to keep; this is a world in which you find what you can and use it for as long as possible before it breaks or you find something better. This frequent shifting ensures that Ellie stays forever in danger. Naughty Dog did something fascinating with the game\u2019s difficulty levels, however, giving the player a huge number of options about how they\u2019d like to play. There\u2019s no catch-all \u201ceasy mode\u201d or \u201chard mode,\u201d but rather a collection of settings you can turn up or down.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e420ac7-c6bb-424f-bca3-395e4d851644": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e420ac7-c6bb-424f-bca3-395e4d851644", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee245411-9070-4123-a373-3ec3313b1fc4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b0d58f08f4b6158532b4e5ce1af115f55f15b859e36a2879b7c6d088e5d93b9"}, "3": {"node_id": "a739b713-eda2-482c-bfea-9d0662feb4bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a4fa037845f334df176f8c437e0d906240e551fb8a14509bc4fc1edae27e9a5"}}, "hash": "dc8bbbc87cd013191841c6237a97e0c7453e3b56aa9675a92601c9adcd0d02b5", "text": "You can adjust your allies\u2019 health, for example, or increase the number of items Ellie finds while scavenging, while still leaving the enemies just as strong.

This ability to almost roll your own difficulty level makes Part 2 significantly easier to play than its predecessor, if you need, or want, it to be.It will, however, be just as emotionally draining. There is no accessibility slider for that.Much of the game\u2019s story revolves around the aftermath of the decision Joel made in the hospital at the end of The Last of Us \u2014 not in terms of the big-picture ways in which it affected the entire planet, but rather, the extremely micro ways in which it has affected the personal feelings of Joel, Ellie, and a few other characters, as each of them learns the truth. The problem is that Part 2 becomes torture to play if you already disagree with Joel\u2019s decision, or, heck, even if you just had some doubts about whether it was the right call. \u201cFeel bad about the fact that you\u2019re doing all of this,\u201d the creative team seems to whisper to you, again and again, describing things I already didn\u2019t want Ellie to actually do, but had no choice in if I wanted the game\u2019s story to continue. I was never given any other options, but that didn\u2019t stop the game\u2019s writing for blaming me for its own story. Would the designers feel better, would I be less complicit, if I just refused to buy or play the game at all?This game couldn\u2019t exist if Ellie could just let go, or learn to meditate, or find a cognitive behavioral therapy workbook, or something. This is not a story of healthy humans finding happiness and building a community together, nor is it a story about someone who learns to love and trust others again despite experiencing absurd levels of trauma and loss. It is a story of a young woman who learned the wrong lessons from her surrogate father, and thus believes the ends justify the means. And the means will almost always include inflicting violence on others. Ellie embraces the role of antihero, just as Joel did, and Naughty Dog makes its queer woman protagonist act just as violent and self-involved as the legions of grizzled straight-white-dude video game protagonists who have preceded her. There\u2019s something that feels off about that straightforward swap here; it\u2019s a missed opportunity to explore how the rage of a marginalized character might take on a different form, and what that form may look and sound like. I felt so much hope at the idea of embodying Ellie instead of Joel in this game, but the entire arc she follows was an arc that I easily could have imagined Joel taking instead of her. That felt disappointing, but not entirely unrealistic. Self-absorbed white teenage lesbians certainly exist, and they\u2019re out there, wearing Chucks and writing mediocre poetry in their journals, just like Ellie does in this game. All the other characters seem like real people, too, even if they might make some shitty choices. But hey, people make shitty choices. It\u2019s kinda what real people do. Part 2\u2019s naturalistic dialogue, bespoke animations, and exploration of subtle body language allow it to cut much deeper when, inevitably, several of these folks die in gruesome, arguably needless ways.And why? Sure, the real world is brutal and horrific, and this post-apocalyptic fictional world, all the more so. Yet humans can learn and they can change, and that\u2019s what makes a story satisfying, even if it\u2019s a sad one. I wanted these characters to realize and overcome their flaws, to transform in some way, however small. But, again, Part 2 doesn\u2019t tell a story about that. It tells a story about a cycle of violence that no one can escape, and especially not me, the person playing the game. Ellie is trapped, somehow unable to grow, learn, or change, and I\u2019m stuck with her.The writing in The Last of Us Part 2 emphasizes that even the most justified of grievances can grow like a cancer and destroy us, if we let it. That\u2019s the story that the game wants to tell \u2014 a story of someone infected by something they don\u2019t have the tools to stop.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a739b713-eda2-482c-bfea-9d0662feb4bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "a739b713-eda2-482c-bfea-9d0662feb4bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e420ac7-c6bb-424f-bca3-395e4d851644", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc8bbbc87cd013191841c6237a97e0c7453e3b56aa9675a92601c9adcd0d02b5"}, "3": {"node_id": "b21a55bb-884c-47ac-8c57-9b757796c8bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db398e2e107018cddff82dccdc902ed4bd77f0f5c8d8767879de410383820070"}}, "hash": "8a4fa037845f334df176f8c437e0d906240e551fb8a14509bc4fc1edae27e9a5", "text": "It makes poetic sense, given that the game is about a brain-eating fungus, as it turns out that Ellie doesn\u2019t need to be infected to turn into an absolutely monstrous killing machine.  But when the game gave me more and more information about Ellie\u2019s opponents, painting them as fully realized humans who also deserved to live, the effort felt wasted. I was already convinced that Ellie was handling things the wrong way, and that Joel had made a terrible mistake in the first game. The Last of Us Part 2 didn\u2019t need to force me to kill a dog in order to get me to see that it\u2019s bad to kill dogs. But, of course, it still made me do that. Just to be sure I really got it. I felt annoyed, not reflective. Like, come on, you think I need this much convincing? Does Naughty Dog think we\u2019re all out here killing dogs, unaware that doing so is a horrific cruelty? This story seems to think I need to experience ridiculous levels of virtual violence in order to believe that maybe, just maybe, Ellie should have learned a little more about her enemies\u2019 personal situations and motivations before slamming a baseball bat into their skulls.Playing The Last of Us Part 2, a game that supposes that humans will enact violence upon one another to their dying breaths, is a very strange thing in 2020. Naughty Dog created a world in which people across America react to a massive structural crisis by dividing and disconnecting from others, rather than uniting together to demand something better \u2014 not just for themselves, but for the most marginalized people in their communities. I see a widespread level of selflessness and an intense care for the preservation of human life in the real 2020, in fact, and an increasingly loud demand for a society that meets that need. Our systems have failed, in large part, but individual people remain strong and kind. Things have rarely been worse, but there is hope to be found in the actions of average folks fighting to do the right thing. We don\u2019t need a video game to rub our noses in hatred and violence to know that other people who are just trying to survive aren\u2019t the real enemy.The Last of Us Part 2 depicts individual people who are instead ruthless, capable, yet self-absorbed, and whose perception of violence is limited to how it affects them and their chosen family members. They are almost unbelievably unable to see the bigger picture. Part 2 ends up feeling needlessly bleak, at a time when a nihilistic worldview has perhaps never been less attractive. Its characters are surviving, but they\u2019re not learning, and they\u2019re certainly not making anything better. Maybe the most surprising thing that The Last of Us Part 2 offered me was the surety that, while the game was made with great skill and craft, we are actually much, much better than Naughty Dog thinks we are.

Its main setting of a post-apocalyptic Seattle is huge and challenging to navigate\u2014when you aren\u2019t fighting, you\u2019re pushing debris out of the way, squeezing through gaps, and crawling under rubble. This gives the game a sense of effort and scale that make traversing a few city blocks feel like a huge adventure, but it\u2019s also exhausting.As suggested by interviews with its creators and its own marketing, The Last of Us 2 is meant to feel very, very bad. Director Neil Druckmann has touted the game, as he described in one video, as \u201ca commentary about the cycle of violence\u201d and a game that asks \u201cphilosophical questions\u201d about revenge and consequences. Pre-release marketing made it clear the game would be a divisively violent, difficult experience. Going in, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted a game that asked me questions about the consequences of my actions, since I live in the world we all find ourselves in now, where I\u2019m hyper-aware of the fact that a careless cough in the grocery store could kill someone I\u2019ve never met. I knew it would be hard to play, especially now. I knew I probably wouldn\u2019t enjoy it in any traditional sense.My playthrough of The Last of Us 2 felt terrible to experience. Over the course of my 27 hours with the game, it grew to the point of feeling nearly unbearable. This wasn\u2019t because it asked me hard questions about my own capacity for harm or revenge, or pulled some Spec Ops: The Line-style moralizing about video game violence. Despite Druckmann\u2019s promised \u201cphilosophical questions,\u201d I never felt like the game asked me anything. Instead, it told me \u201cbrutality,\u201d repeatedly and louder, until by the end I couldn\u2019t hear what it was trying to say at all. Characters make hideous, irredeemable choices, over and over. Everybody suffers, physically and emotionally, in graphic detail. This is all intended to prove a point, but the only point I got from the game was simply to be required to stare at violence, and play through violence, and then do that again, and more, and again, and more.A lot of this violence is just run-of-the-mill games violence, the kind I honestly don\u2019t spend a lot of my time worrying about. The game\u2019s world has been overtaken by a fungal infection that\u2019s turned most of the population into zombies called Infected. They\u2019re half-monster and half-plant, and they come in varieties that require different strategies. They\u2019re terrifying and beautiful, and you respond to that beauty by knifing them in showers of blood and listening to them writhe and scream when you light them on fire with explosives. You also kill a lot of human enemies, whom the developers have given names and friends, and whose beliefs have led them to join one of two factions: the militant Washington Liberation Front or the religious Seraphites. Despite the factions\u2019 ideological differences, they all die the same when you shotgun them in the face or nail them with an arrow. They cry in fear or call for the friends you\u2019ve either killed or are about to. One faction has scent-tracking dogs\u2014who you\u2019ll also kill\u2014who whine over their dead masters.You\u2019re supposed to feel bad about this\u2014in his preview of a section of the game, Kotaku\u2019s reporter Nathan quoted narrative lead Halley Gross (known for her work on HBO\u2019s Westworld) as saying of combat, \u201cSo much of what we\u2019re trying to do is create empathy for the other. We make this enemy, and then how do we make you feel for them?\u201d But the game\u2019s story has so much more violence, so much more suffering that plays out over multi-stage quests and long cutscenes and effortful quicktime events, that I lost the ability to care about these everyday acts of carnage or whether I could have avoided them. There was only one combat moment in which I actually felt a moral qualm about killing enemies. I tried to avoid it, but as soon as my stealth attempt failed, I just shot my way through the survivors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "414166e5-718c-446b-a2ee-6ef9088791d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "414166e5-718c-446b-a2ee-6ef9088791d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "b21a55bb-884c-47ac-8c57-9b757796c8bd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db398e2e107018cddff82dccdc902ed4bd77f0f5c8d8767879de410383820070"}, "3": {"node_id": "96e18716-9cb4-4af8-9f83-27dad900fc99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc8c0e34d615b0a173aa72bd6b0a32e36dee0afd5a90158889f64349294ab9b6"}}, "hash": "4a23bcd1b60a1c02cfdfa9a7c41091271ac281636397b9178632cd285ce61a63", "text": "This is perhaps a commentary\u2014that it\u2019s easier to inflict harm to get what you want than not\u2014but by that point the game\u2019s violence had worn me down so much that even these characters with names and friends and pets were just more virtual bodies on the pile.If you\u2019ve read this far into the review looking for more details about just what this game is about, there\u2019s a catch. Even though many of the game\u2019s plot details were unexpectedly leaked via a hack in late April, a condition of us being able to review the game a week early with a Sony-provided copy is that we can\u2019t spoil certain things. There\u2019s plenty in the game I wouldn\u2019t have spoiled anyway, since it\u2019s full of events that are meant to surprise. And I can say that, having dug into those leaks, there was plenty in the game that surprised and shocked me. But key parts of the game\u2019s story are off-limits here\u2014not just how the game ends, for example, but also how it begins\u2014as are large portions vital to explaining why I felt how I did about it. People who\u2019ve seen the leaks may know some of this\u2014though not all\u2014but for the purposes of this review, there\u2019s a whole lot to talk around.The original The Last of Us told a story that felt small and human, whereas the second tells one of all-consuming vengeance. In that first game, a gruff middle-aged smuggler named Joel has to shepherd a 14-year-old girl named Ellie across the post-apocalyptic United States. Ellie is immune to the outbreak, and Joel is taking her to a medical base to see if her immunity can help create a vaccine. In the game\u2019s astonishing ending\u2014spoilers?\u2014when Joel learns that making the vaccine will kill Ellie, he murders the doctor and takes her from the hospital. He lies to her about what happened, telling her a cure is impossible. The player is left wondering if Ellie believes him in the game\u2019s last moments.The Last of Us 2 begins four years after that moment, 25 years into the outbreak. Joel and Ellie, now 19, live in a settlement in Wyoming. They\u2019re estranged from each other, and their interactions are sorrowful and tense. Ellie\u2019s life is grim, but it has safety and goodness too. When the game starts, she\u2019s recently shared a kiss with a woman named Dina, an event Naughty Dog showed in the game\u2019s E3 2018 gameplay trailer. In the early hours, players get a glimpse of Ellie and Dina\u2019s lives. They go on patrol for Infected; they smoke a joint; they have sex; they start falling in love.The characters are diverse, covering a range of genders, sexualities, and ethnicities. The game handles all of this well, neither downplaying it nor drawing undue attention to it. In a masterful scene, Ellie and Dina both share secrets; as a queer player, it felt wonderful to see queer characters confess things other than their sexuality. While I don\u2019t consider representation alone an accomplishment, I appreciated the diverse cast. The game doesn\u2019t make any big statements about it, which feels like the right choice\u2014different kinds of people exist, and they face the game\u2019s world, good and bad, like everyone else.Despite the things in Ellie\u2019s life that are going well, what happened at the hospital haunts her, and it strains her relationship with Joel. The lie eats at them both, whether they know it\u2019s a lie or not. Joel struggles with the consequences of his choices; Ellie struggles to trust him while wrestling with her immunity to the outbreak and what good it could have done. There\u2019s a way in which she\u2019s untouched by the problem everyone else is having\u2014she can\u2019t get the disease that has taken so much from the world\u2014but, as the player knows, any possibility that she could have done something about it is long dead.I would have gladly played a version of The Last of Us 2 that explored these themes, that, like the first game, focused on the very human struggles of its characters set against a grim and brutal world. But that\u2019s not the game we get. Inevitably, a violent tragedy ensues in Jackson.

Ellie sets off on a revenge quest that consumes the rest of the game, which sends you to Seattle, puts you between two warring groups, and\u2014those restrictions again!\u2014escalates in gruesome ways.The game sends you on its revenge quest in a way that feels both narratively relentless and physically slow. In the early parts of the game, there are long stretches between combat and narrative in which you laboriously pick your way through the ruins of Seattle. By the middle of the game, I was fighting through consecutive tense areas that took time to navigate, and I\u2019d long for a breather so my heart could stop pounding. Other times, something terrible would happen, only for me to be thrown back into combat without a moment to take it in. Tragic story events happened one after another. The game is divided into chapters, but events sometimes escalate without offering a natural stopping point, pushing me on even as I recoiled from what I\u2019d witnessed.Almost every moment in The Last of Us 2 is hard. Much like in the first game, it takes forever to get anywhere, and so many objects in your way need to be lifted, pulled, and pried via button presses. Here, you can also crawl under things, squeeze through tight gaps, and throw and climb ropes, which you have to slowly gather one coil at a time. The obstacles in the first game created a pace that made sense\u2014you were traveling across the country, after all\u2014and here the new and old features combine evocatively with the size and wilderness of Seattle to make it feel treacherous. While The Last of Us 2 never quite pulls off the beauty of the original\u2019s giraffe moment, the nature that\u2019s overtaken Seattle is gorgeous and awe-inspiring. Rapids crash through what used to be downtown streets, trees tower overhead, and the damp, lush greenery feel both prehistoric and so much like the Pacific Northwest. Nature also makes progress difficult; I often hit so many dead ends and overgrown areas in my journey toward a waypoint that I lost all sense of my initial destination until dialogue or a prompt reminded me.Combat seldom picks up the pace. It works fairly similarly to the first game: you\u2019re neither a tank nor a ninja. You\u2019re always outnumbered, and ammunition and crafting parts are in painfully short supply. You can improve your odds a bit via several skill trees, which are unlocked with findable manuals and upgradable with findable pills. There are skills that give you more health, make you move faster when prone, or let you craft more quickly. You can also upgrade your guns at workbenches using scavenged parts, reducing sway or increasing damage. All of this necessitates scavenging, which you\u2019ll also need to do to find parts to craft pipe bombs, molotovs, and certain kinds of ammo. This search draws out combat moments: you\u2019ll kill a few enemies, detour to rummage through drawers for supplies, hide somewhere to craft, and then head back to the fight. I enjoyed this pace, even when it made me ache for an encounter to be over.\u201cWhat if every terrible thing you can think of, but more of it?\u201dMisery simulatorUniquely slow pace, beautiful natureViolence and suffering overwhelmed the story, felt like brutality simply for the sake of it Naughty DogPlayStation 4June 19, 2020About 27 hours for a full playthroughYour best bet in combat is to sneak around picking off enemies one by one, aided by the \u201clistening\u201d ability that lets you see their outlines through walls. You can hide behind cover, or go prone in grass, but none of this is quite as sharp as it would be in a true stealth game. In most of my battles, something inevitably went wrong and multiple enemies would rush me. In these moments, I had better luck running frantically than standing my ground, where scarcity made head-on battles difficult and wasteful. Combat went the best for me when enemies would come to investigate a downed colleague and I could pick them off individually, or when they were far enough apart that I could take them down unseen. In these instances, I\u2019d fall into a compelling rhythm of sneaking and grabbing. But then a particularly dangerous Infected would appear who\u2019d require too much attention or ammo, or I\u2019d run out of crafting materials necessary to keep fighting, or the door I\u2019d finally made it to was locked and I knew it would be another real-world hour before I moved the story forward.

I\u2019d long to be done with what I was experiencing, only to have no choice but to trudge through it.If The Last of Us 2 was just a game where its story unfolded between characters while you played slow combat and explored nature, I would have found it fine. If it kept the emotional weight of the original, the relatable ways the characters\u2019 relationships formed and dissolved, it would have resonated with me the way the first game did. I played that game for the first time with friends on release day; one of my friends, a comedian, did most of the playing as the weekend wore on. She made such great jokes while she did\u2014the hilarious internal monologue she spun for Joel sticks in my memory seven years later\u2014but as we played, the jokes faded out. We both sobbed at the end. It felt like we\u2019d shared something incredibly special, an experience a game had never given us before. I\u2019ve played the game on my own since, as well as the Left Behind DLC, but they\u2019ve never affected me as much as seeing the original\u2019s final moments for the first time.The Last of Us 2 didn\u2019t give me any moments like that. In the above-quoted video, Druckmann says the core of the game is about \u201cthese really intimate, intense relationships.\u201d I bring this up not to quote the game\u2019s marketing, but to try to understand what the people who made it thought they were doing. The story I experienced was about relationships only insofar as characters did things to each other. I didn\u2019t learn anything about what it means to be human, or what we\u2019re capable of when we\u2019re hurt, or what can happen when we want to hurt others. The way Joel hurt Ellie in The Last of Us felt relatable to me; even if the fate of humanity has never hung in the balance, I know how it feels to make a desperate, selfish choice to hang on to something you love. The Last of Us 2\u2019s amount of cruelty and violence ultimately overwhelmed any chance of that relatability here. I didn\u2019t find it prurient\u2014the game doesn\u2019t relish in its gory deaths or emotional suffering. It just takes every opportunity to show them, over and over, and decides that counts as saying something about them. It showed me so much ugliness, and in such detail, that I felt numb as terrible things befell more characters I cared about. Sometimes I did these terrible things myself, through gameplay. Sometimes I just watched things play out in front of me with no say in the matter, a lack of agency that was so skillfully used in the first game. Neither circumstance felt more affecting than the other; both just felt like more. The game\u2019s diversity, which I appreciated at the beginning, just felt like an equal opportunity for different kinds of people to suffer as the game went on. Eventually, my numbness turned to an anger I\u2019ve never felt about a video game. Late one night, I paused the game and asked myself aloud if the developers thought I was stupid, if they thought the existence of violence had just never occurred to me before.It\u2019s difficult to talk about all of this a week before most of you reading can play the game for yourself. In a recent fawning piece in British GQ, Druckmann is quoted as saying, \u201cThere were people [at Naughty Dog]\u2014a minority of them\u2014that were just stuck on how violent it [the game] is and how dark and quite cynical it is about mankind.\u201d That even the people who made the game are divided about it is a clear sign that players are going to have radically different experiences. The first game\u2019s story was polarizing; this one\u2019s will clearly be as well. So many people worked on this game for so long, and at such cost, that I want The Last Of Us 2 to be more than the experience I had. It\u2019s a visually beautiful game that feels distinct to play, and the story it tells and how it tells it, at the most basic level, certainly pushes the edges of what games have done before. None of those accomplishments elevated or redeemed it for me. Like the nature consuming Seattle, or the outbreak consuming humanity, its ugliness overshadowed everything else.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3dcfdf3-b7a3-4400-bb37-e1894ac34f27": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3dcfdf3-b7a3-4400-bb37-e1894ac34f27", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "174bde36-f1c5-465f-8f53-76b54a777f73", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "63f50bf652912a7e6a981d8a3fa6c664eee95bda0eb363ed9e5ee0a2e1f62212"}, "3": {"node_id": "8f558f46-0a38-4c09-91bb-00901068af41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d3761c37594d1937242d33eb84817551f76710bc61a51db29f1fb0b553a2394"}}, "hash": "0a5e56e2b57b48ca738365aa702a5c41c04c0536ab47341a336fe4d243fd582a", "text": "USgamer, \u201cAn eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.\u201d\nThis adage about revenge is even truer in a world ravaged by cordyceps: a parasitic fungus that takes over human physiology, mutating people until their heads pop like corn, folding eyes under flaps of skin and growth, leaving hosts gnashing and clawing in the dark. If humanity can\u2019t unite, these eyeless horrors will inherit the Earth.The Last of Us is a character study of a smuggler and a survivor - Joel and Ellie - trekking across post-apocalyptic America. The original game opened with Joel\u2019s daughter being killed, and he carries the guilt of being unable to save her across the US with him as emotional baggage. He offloads that baggage onto Ellie, a teenager who\u2019s immune to the outbreak - his self-appointed surrogate daughter. By the end they share a Stockholm Syndrome-esque affection, bonded through shared trauma.\n\nOnce they reach the Fireflies - a group who claim they can fashion a cure from Ellie\u2019s DNA - Joel discovers the procedure will kill her. He assaults the hospital, guns down the surgeons, and escapes with Ellie still sedated. When she wakes, he says they just ran some tests and discharged her. He lies. The Last of Us Part 2 deals with the consequences of both the killings and the lie.Fans of the original might be concerned that forcing a story with such a perfect ending to continue would tarnish the original\u2019s legacy. Fortunately, that isn\u2019t the case. This is a companion piece that manages to introduce new characters and themes while also making the original story stronger simply by existing. Conversations that you\u2019ve forgotten take on new meaning, beloved characters become more nuanced. When it ends, it imprints the same satisfaction of a story well told, packaged within Naughty Dog\u2019s best game.It opens with Joel talking to his brother, Tommy. \u201cI saved her,\u201d he says as the camera cuts to a bloody hospital corridor filled with bodies. Three syllables explain how Joel justifies himself. He didn\u2019t kill them, he rescued Ellie. But he stripped away her agency, and he knows he\u2019s no hero.Where the original game opened with explosions, this prologue is more understated, poignant. It\u2019s a story about facing the consequences of your actions, how everyone finds their inner strength in a different place, and how revenge can spiral out of control until you lose everything.We play as Ellie four years on from the lie, living some semblance of a normal life in the walled town of Jackson. Joel occasionally visits her cabin to tell her dad jokes. She listens to music on a cassette player, and a lava lamp bubbles away on her desk. Sketches and posters litter the walls of her room. In Joel\u2019s cabin, there\u2019s woodwork tables, wooden carvings, and family photos. On his bedside table sits a pair of reading glasses and a book, An Idiot\u2019s Guide to Space - his way of attempting to rekindle their paternal relationship. The world is stuffed with little details like this that enrich the story and reward your curiosity.It is the morning after the winter dance and Ellie's getting ready for patrol. She gets her backpack, grabs her pistol, and cocks the slider with a yawn. She doesn\u2019t curse under her breath when people get curb stomped anymore - violence is normalised, and this is just an ordinary day. Until it isn\u2019t.The main story takes place over three days, as opposed to the four seasons structure of the original. At the same time, it jumps back and forth from the past to the present, introducing characters you initially hate before making you fall in love with them. It manages to be hopeful, bleak, funny, sad, peaceful, and frightening, running the gamut of human emotion, but masterfully paced out so you\u2019re never overwhelmed.Every character is complex and human. It might be Naughty Dog\u2019s biggest game, but it\u2019s the studio\u2019s leanest script - you\u2019re trusted to understand subtext. The dialogue has an almost surgical precision to it. It also does things I\u2019ve never seen before, in ways only video games can. It is a generation-defining masterpiece.There\u2019s a structural pattern that\u2019s similar to other Naughty Dog games, of course. You see a landmark, you head towards it, and you have pockets of adventure along the way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f558f46-0a38-4c09-91bb-00901068af41": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f558f46-0a38-4c09-91bb-00901068af41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3dcfdf3-b7a3-4400-bb37-e1894ac34f27", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a5e56e2b57b48ca738365aa702a5c41c04c0536ab47341a336fe4d243fd582a"}, "3": {"node_id": "36d24347-bbf0-4bc2-983f-794124c5f8da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "44861cde15254fe101a900d346736e0df6120a35b31a932fd0868951057952c3"}}, "hash": "1d3761c37594d1937242d33eb84817551f76710bc61a51db29f1fb0b553a2394", "text": "There are hub-style areas where you can explore optional buildings around Seattle, but the majority of the game is linear - tailored maps with multiple routes through ruined buildings, via underground train stations, and lush, overgrown parks. There\u2019s surprising variety to the places you visit, though, and a strong sense of discovery, awe, and exploration, despite that linearity.There are tense stealth sections, huge battles, blood-curdling horror scenes, exciting chase sequences, three-way conflicts, moments of quiet exploration, and even environmental puzzles that aren\u2019t just based on carrying ladders around.It builds slowly - it is hours before you fight any humans - with relationships and character growth at the fore. You pick through buildings and see the ghost of a world that\u2019s alien to these young survivors, scavenging for supplies, ignoring the whiteboards filled with pitch-meeting notes and profit forecasts. It earns its action and that lends it more impact as a result.Things ramp up in intensity as the story goes on, but it\u2019s interspersed with those aforementioned flashbacks. These give you room to breathe when the main story is going full throttle. In one, you explore a museum with Joel and Ellie. There\u2019s no combat, just two characters bonding as you interact with props. It\u2019s one of my favourite sequences in a game ever, and lands harder than any virtual bullet.It\u2019s not something I expected going in, but The Last of Us Part 2 reminds me of Metal Gear Solid 5 mechanically. You spend much of the game laid prone in the grass, slithering between patrol routes. You cut through and around buildings, slip through small gaps, and hide under trucks and trains. It\u2019s stealth that\u2019s designed to keep you moving, to keep you reacting and improvising, to keep you clenching your jaw - and not just because you don\u2019t want a bloater to rip it off.Level design is Naughty Dog\u2019s best, each encounter offering multiple routes and opportunities for stealth, action, and a blend of the two. You\u2019re constantly segueing in and out of stealth as you pick off enemies with guerrilla tactics. It makes you feel like a deadly hunter one minute and timid prey the next. The AI coordinates, using vantage points and pincer tactics, flanking and flushing out: they pull you by a leg as you hide underneath a truck; they sweep buildings like a SWAT team. It\u2019s more dynamic than the original - unpredictable and exciting.In one scene, the two main enemy factions are fighting, one side standing in the flooded streets and the other in a ruined building overlooking the open space. I park my boat and crawl, fully submerged, through the knee-high water. The Seraphites, a group of religious fanatics who communicate via whistles (which are somehow more unnerving than the echo-location clicks from an infected) are winning. They\u2019re raining down molotov cocktails on the WLF (or Wolves) below. Covered by the screams, I crawl onto a waterlogged bank, pull out my rifle, and take aim at a Seraphite through my scope. I pull the trigger and skull fragments explode from the back of his head, alerting the others.As I continue picking them off, I\u2019m distracted by nearby splashing so I pull my eye from the scope to see two of them swimming at me, one from each side. I switch to my shotgun and take one of their heads off, using the last remaining shell to rip the leg from my other attacker. From the building, I hear their allies screaming their names.When I first played The Last of Us Part 2, I misunderstood the intent behind this. Every single human in this game has a name, and soldiers call out for their fallen friends and use names in idle chatter. I thought this was to make you feel guilty for shoving a switchblade into their neck, but it\u2019s not just that.Naughty Dog names the enemies in The Last of Us Part 2 as a thematic choice. This is a story of revenge, and names remind you that these aren\u2019t faceless drones: each person you kill could leave behind a loved one who might want payback. Good and evil is a matter of perspective in a lawless world where people act on survival instinct. It\u2019s holistic - gameplay and story in harmony. Even a minigame where you pluck at the strings of a fully functional guitar serves a purpose in the larger tale.Every mechanic and story beat reinforces the themes. Combat is scrappy and messy. Incoming shots sometimes knock you onto your back where you\u2019re free to return fire in a desperate effort.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36d24347-bbf0-4bc2-983f-794124c5f8da": {"__data__": {"id_": "36d24347-bbf0-4bc2-983f-794124c5f8da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f558f46-0a38-4c09-91bb-00901068af41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d3761c37594d1937242d33eb84817551f76710bc61a51db29f1fb0b553a2394"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b8d3d6b-db98-4fd2-a159-6c35c8f70ad7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aa2a9788ad027aa1572ff3bfe5068c2c5a0f0853ab9c5c0db1b2700d8e5ba893"}}, "hash": "44861cde15254fe101a900d346736e0df6120a35b31a932fd0868951057952c3", "text": "In one scene, Ellie kills someone who\u2019s playing Hotline Miami on a PS Vita. She looks so ordinary, but she attacks you. It\u2019s self defense. The next minute she\u2019s bleeding out on the floor as the music from her portable console rings out. It\u2019s fitting, because the aftermath of each battle reminded me of Dennaton Games\u2019 indie hit.Hotline Miami features a repeating cycle of top-down violence punctuated by a slow walk back through that carnage, over bodies and through corridors painted in blood. It wordlessly asks you to reflect on your violent deeds.Here that same feeling translates to a 3D, photorealistic scene. Bodies lay limp with jaws ripped from their face, teeth missing, blood spilling from the exit wound. Shoot someone with an explosive arrow indoors and a chunk of flesh might stick to the ceiling and drip down in the aftermath - a thick splash of liquid and unidentifiable body parts where a human once stood. Shoot someone in the throat and they die with a gargle, bleeding out and twitching as blood pools around them. It\u2019s horrific, but it all works together to create a mood of unease.The brilliant acting makes everything land harder. When the characters cry out, you feel it. When they say one thing and mean another, you get it. Every little facial tic, every shaking hand - Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, Ian Alexander, and Shannon Woodward all put in the performances of a lifetime, but even most of the side characters leave a lasting impression.When the credits rolled on The Last of Us Part 2 I was still buzzing from the excitement of the final few hours. My loyalty shifted between characters. I grew to love who I hated and dislike who I loved. I laughed, I teared up. I felt anger and elation. It\u2019s the new high water mark for video game characters and I can\u2019t wait for everyone to see just how special it is. As soon as it ended, I booted up New Game Plus and I\u2019m experiencing it again with my eyes open, the context of the finished story imprinting new meaning into those early scenes and characters. I\u2019m not swiping in the dark anymore.Version tested: PS4 Pro - a review copy was provided by Sony. \n        Sign in and unlock a world of features\n      \n        Get access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nKirk McKeand\n\n          Contributor\n        \nPlease enable JavaScript to see comments.      \n\nEven The Last of Us developer, Naughty Dog, can\u2019t avoid cutting back development in 2023                    \n\n\nWHAT AN ACT\n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 proves David Cage right about LA Noire                    \n\n\nNoted\n\n\nThe Last of Us Part 2's composer may have confirmed the game is getting a new release                    \n\n\nThe Last of Us 2 safe codes and combinations - all safe locations                    \n\n\nLasting Impact\n\n\nBungie reportedly expressed concerns over how engaging The Last of Us multiplayer project was                    \n\n\nPlay It By Year\n\n\nThe Last of Us season 2 should arrive \"end of 2024, early 2025\" says Bella Ramsey                    \n\n\nPart 2, Part A\n\n\nThe Last of Us Part 2 won't be condensed into just one season", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b8d3d6b-db98-4fd2-a159-6c35c8f70ad7": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b8d3d6b-db98-4fd2-a159-6c35c8f70ad7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "36d24347-bbf0-4bc2-983f-794124c5f8da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "44861cde15254fe101a900d346736e0df6120a35b31a932fd0868951057952c3"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bbbe20a-60c8-4270-9113-9c385b3f2715", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5719227a96821406782aae09ae3e5073a08f4ddb2304bec9ebf51da2b1f18179"}}, "hash": "aa2a9788ad027aa1572ff3bfe5068c2c5a0f0853ab9c5c0db1b2700d8e5ba893", "text": "Naughty Dog is holding off on announcing its next game to encourage a better work-life balance                    \n\n\nTEXTBOOK BOONDOGGLE\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 review: The best psychological horror game I\u2019ve played in generations                    \n\n\nGOTTA RUN\n\n\nGhostrunner 2 review: an imperfect game that understands the rule of cool                    \n\n\nLIQUID'S IN\n\n\nMetal Gear Solid Master Collection (Vol 1) review: A soft collection of solid games                    \n\n\nSHOTS MISSED\n\n\nLords of the Fallen review: fertile ground for a sequel, but leaves a lot to be desired                    \n\n\nCITY PERFORMANCE\n\n\nCities Skylines 2 review: a solid foundation for a spec-hungry future classic                    \n\n\nTUSKMASTER\n\n\nSuper Mario Bros.

Ambiguity as poetic as that is woefully uncommon and a follow-up could easily dismantle that purity. Instead of letting naughty dogs lie, developer Naughty Dog decided to make the inconclusive ending more conclusive with The Last of Us 2. This remarkably ambitious sequel shares some of the qualities of its predecessor, but, much like a host fighting a fungal infection, that same ambition has also taken over and turned the game into a shambling husk of its former self.ALSO:\u00a0China gets The Last of Us 2 credit card \u2014 but the game isn\u2019t likely to launch thereIt does take a while for the fungal infection to hit its peak as The Last of Us 2 pushes forward in addition to stumbling backwards. Combat holds most of this advancing momentum since many of its intricacies have been appropriately tuned to add to its tension without diminishing any of its established tenets.Those foundational bricks haven\u2019t been dramatically rearranged but thoughtfully reinforced. Skirmishes still rely heavily on hide-and-seek strategies that give players plenty of ways to experiment and think tactically. Sneaking yields many options \u2014 some peaceful, others brutal \u2014 as you crawl around and eliminate or completely avoid the scores of foes that hunt you down. The open, circular level design and basic set of distraction and offensive stealth tools let you pick either path, too.Of course, these sneaky mechanics sit alongside traditional third-person shooting but falling somewhere in the middle between stealth and loud firefights is where The Last of Us has always made its mark. Aware and unpredictable enemies ensure that almost no plan goes off without a hitch, forcing you to improvise for your survival. Hurriedly chucking a brick at a nearby WLF soldier to safely get away or setting the perfect mine with your final bit of explosive material is a rush as you use your greater wits to match their greater numbers \u2014 a nail-biting thrill that only climbs as the difficulty does.And even though they are quite intelligent, calling out your specific location and flanking you every chance they get, they\u2019re also not omnipotent gods like most other video game foes. They\u2019ll lose you and are susceptible to traps; a realistic touch that allows for such an engaging fluidity between stealth and aggressive gunplay.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bbbe20a-60c8-4270-9113-9c385b3f2715": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bbbe20a-60c8-4270-9113-9c385b3f2715", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b8d3d6b-db98-4fd2-a159-6c35c8f70ad7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aa2a9788ad027aa1572ff3bfe5068c2c5a0f0853ab9c5c0db1b2700d8e5ba893"}, "3": {"node_id": "f47b527c-dc88-4723-9912-1efdd7f1d669", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "34430f1ad7f5144097f19567ab2de4aa26b81b66414d05e2c2f7ea644961152c"}}, "hash": "5719227a96821406782aae09ae3e5073a08f4ddb2304bec9ebf51da2b1f18179", "text": "The impulsive infected aren\u2019t quite as cerebral and are more chaotic yet utilize the same strengths as the human fights\u00a0without being a carbon copy of them.Arenas are also full of multiple rooms, buildings, and paths and when combined with the breadth of the weapons and aforementioned lively AI, fights are destined to play out differently each time and have unique hotspots. The powder keg of unique components is prime for player-generated stories as each of its disparate elements clash in a near infinite amount of ways.All of that has been carried over from the first game almost to a fault as familiarity can occasionally begin to rear its ugly, fungus-ridden head, yet its ability to slightly improve upon that unrivaled foundation acts as a cure for complete stagnation. Being able to go prone and slither around like a snake (or Snake) opens new places to hide from eyeballs and gunfire; a simple ability with two practical uses. Dodging is similarly a multi-use addition since it inherently makes melee scuffles less mashy and lets you evade a lunging Clicker or Bloater charge with relative ease, granted you can react in time.The Last of Us 2 sadly doesn\u2019t have many new enemy types as it is boxed in by lore that already depicts the complete birth-to-death cycle of the infected. But the two main new additions do fit well into the established roster.Dogs keep you moving during stealth since they can sniff you out and can quickly hone in on you like furry homing missiles during alert phases. Shamblers are a mix of Bloaters and Clickers, striking an unoccupied middle ground between the two advanced mushroom monsters. In an otherwise almost identical lineup of enemies, both do a solid enough job of adding just one more factor to the already long list of systems that bounce off each other and make the combat so personal and rewarding.The absurd amount of customization makes the experience even more personal. Few, if any, games have as wide of an array of knobs and levers that let you fine-tune almost every moving part. While most of it is centralized around addressing different types of accessibility, this also carries over to the difficulty.Each pillar of the game from enemy damage, awareness, level of resources, and player health can be managed independently, letting players discover the type of experience they want the game to be. From players who want to make the stealth a tad easier to those who want to have more legible fonts, The Last of Us 2 is an empowering experience for almost every possible type of player because of these extensive options.None of these toggles can change the story, which is where the game takes its biggest swings and, subsequently, its biggest whiffs. The Last of Us 2 opts to tell a much longer and more complicated tale with a multitude of heavy themes that cover cyclical violence, the follies of revenge, how enemies are perceived and dehumanized, and more.Naughty Dog matches these lofty ideas with gameplay and creates empathy through the controller, marrying the strengths of the medium to the narrative. That even extends to the enemies as they\u2019ll call out Debra\u2019s name as you launch an arrow into their eye socket or cry over Steve as you blow his legs off, further assigning personal touches to random, faceless grunts.Conceptually, it\u2019s an impressive feat. Interactivity is a strong method of bonding characters to the player and the studio\u2019s remarkable attention to performances and animation help create a story with unparalleled production values. The money is on the screen and that never lets up over the 30 or so hours it takes to hit the end credits.However, those 30 or so hours act as a near-fatal bite to the story\u2019s neck and are why many of these ideas are only conceptually engaging. Naughty Dog is a studio that is compulsively (and sometimes destructively) obsessed with perfection, aiming to give ample time to each of its ideas to allow them to grow and develop. Each one needs buildup in order to get a rightfully earned finale.But since there are so many threads, the game has to spend multiple hours building on every one of them in an attempt to tie each of those threads all into a satisfactory bow. The pacing takes a nail bat to the chest as it slogs through setup after setup after setup before it can even begin to get to any sort of payoff from the previously established beats. Reaching climaxes takes even longer as the dangerous and very lootable world encourages you to tiptoe through it, further delaying your narrative payoff as you scrounge for muddy rags and empty wine bottles.The Last of Us 2\u2019s penchant for flashbacks is emblematic of these pacing issues. Both calm and intense scenes are frequently undercut by the urge to jump back and show how that moment happened as the flow is sacrificed by the constant urge for explanation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f47b527c-dc88-4723-9912-1efdd7f1d669": {"__data__": {"id_": "f47b527c-dc88-4723-9912-1efdd7f1d669", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "7bbbe20a-60c8-4270-9113-9c385b3f2715", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5719227a96821406782aae09ae3e5073a08f4ddb2304bec9ebf51da2b1f18179"}, "3": {"node_id": "21a0c46e-192f-4f7e-b22b-686866850b13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "280456e35c804988811940da4407f60bafc66ff4e17311459aa0030c7115ebbe"}}, "hash": "34430f1ad7f5144097f19567ab2de4aa26b81b66414d05e2c2f7ea644961152c", "text": "This happens repeatedly, too, and there are even flashbacks within flashbacks.And when the game is trying to examine so many topics, these introductory bits and blasts from the past pile up and result in a story that has too much going on. This is a little ironic since the beginning often meanders between scenes and fills time with seemingly anticlimactic main objectives. Admirable intent can\u2019t make up for the lack of focus since with every new theme, character, or faction, another explainer \u2014 be it multiple gameplay sections or a trip down memory lane \u2014 is required.More story begets more introductory sequences which begets more story and so on. It\u2019s like the ouroboros of storytelling, which is fitting because The Last of Us 2 feels similarly endless at times. Even the fantastic combat loop grows repetitive in much of the latter third since it, despite its core strengths and numerous upgrade paths, can\u2019t endure and survive quite so many samey encounters.This added complexity is peculiar when compared to how its predecessor was so beloved for its simplicity. Joel and Ellie\u2019s journey was straightforward at its core and found its depth within the cast members and their growth. Simple story, complex characters, as Creative Director Neil Druckmann likes to say.But this game has far too much story to be considered simple and too many people to meaningfully center in on. The Last of Us 2 confuses ambition for depth and drowns in those deep waters and doesn\u2019t have the metaphorical wooden palette to safely traverse the waves.Many of the new characters aren\u2019t even as immediately interesting either and that\u2019s an issue since the game wants you to intimately empathize with almost everyone. Ellie\u2019s trauma isn\u2019t meaningfully explored until later on and her potentially engrossing relationship with Dina takes up so little screen time. She\u2019s also not as plucky as she once was, which means there are fewer avenues for lighthearted quips to balance out the all-encompassing dread.Almost nobody else picks up that slack either. The new roster isn\u2019t as endearing and lives in the shadows of Naughty Dog\u2019s past iconic characters. None of them are outright unlikable yet few rise above anything more than well-animated and refreshingly diverse gluttons for punishment. The humanizing elements are there and the performances are nothing less than fantastic, but they lack the level of charm and personality that made characters like Tess, Bill, and Henry so memorable in the first game.In addition to more story, The Last of Us 2 has more environments as well and even though they too can slightly buckle underneath the game\u2019s girth, they never cease being exceptionally gorgeous and among the PS4\u2019s finest on a technical and artistic level. Realistic lighting, a steady frame rate, and immersive lack of visible load times allow its broken down environments to shine in all of their destroyed beauty. Greenery, spores, or flooding overtaking a nearly extinct society isn\u2019t as new at this point, but it has never looked as good as this.Visual fidelity and a ridiculous attention to detail makes these places feel lived in in a way that surpasses the first title. Environmental storytelling is even stronger here as journals and collectibles paint a more vivid picture of those who have become Clicker chow. They\u2019re small tales that reward vigilant, resource-hungry players who read each short note and demonstrate that the team is fully capable of telling brief yet effective stories.Most even revolve around simple environmental puzzles, which are surprisingly natural and test your practical problem solving skills. They\u2019re not about pushing boxes, but paying attention to the world in ways that don\u2019t feel overtly video gamey. It\u2019s more immersive and fits within the game\u2019s grounded aesthetic.The Last of Us 2 is grounded enough to still contain plenty of traces of its former self. Its stealthy combat loop inspires frenetic yet tactical behavior through its smart enemy AI and resource management that is prime for compelling player-driven stories. The slick presentation and sheer visual fidelity are among the best on the PS4 as its characters and environments are elegantly detailed regardless of their apocalyptic backdrop.However, the fungus spreads as the game progresses and is where it begins to lose its identity. The first half\u2019s semi-aimless and methodical pacing drags in its latter half as it bites off more story than it can comfortably chew and then spends too many hours trying to flesh out each one of its many beats.This excessive padding and theoretically noble attempt to dive into deeper subjects also negatively impacts the gameplay, too, as even its ace combat mechanics can\u2019t quite stay fresh and exciting when repeated that often over the span of 30 hours.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21a0c46e-192f-4f7e-b22b-686866850b13": {"__data__": {"id_": "21a0c46e-192f-4f7e-b22b-686866850b13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "f47b527c-dc88-4723-9912-1efdd7f1d669", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "34430f1ad7f5144097f19567ab2de4aa26b81b66414d05e2c2f7ea644961152c"}, "3": {"node_id": "5748bc05-fbad-4079-8350-6d8e3b2d3867", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2917d1cfd2067e17d3f6acdd0b87961281de83f626dc76ab04079a26c6f063b6"}}, "hash": "280456e35c804988811940da4407f60bafc66ff4e17311459aa0030c7115ebbe", "text": "What\u2019s left is a Bloater that\u2019s forsaken enough of its soul to only just barely still be recognizable in its current form, shuffling around and proving that, unlike Ellie, it is not immune to devolving into a lesser form of itself.GameRevolution reviewed The Last of Us 2 on PS4.

Every once in a while when looking at Joel or Nathan Drake, I imagine Crash going \u201cBooyah Grandma.\u201dBut that just goes to show you how impactful Naughty Dog really is when it comes to the wide world of gaming. Crash, Jak and Daxter, Uncharted, and Last of Us\u00a0all made big splashes when they were released and arguably have enduring appeal (I\u2019m going to bat for the first few\u00a0Jak\u00a0games here).Last of Us Part II\u00a0is no exception, improving what its predecessor did all those years before it.The Last of Us Part II\u00a0(PS4)Developer: Naughty DogPublisher: SonyReleased: June 19, 2020MSRP: $59.99Kicking off with essentially recapping the ending to the first game, Part II\u00a0feels like a true continuation. There\u2019s no weird esoteric side tangent from an unnamed character to parse: it hits the ground running and tells a cohesive emotional story with Ellie at the helm. Ashley Johnson is still fantastic as Ellie all these years on, and she has a whole lot more to work with in the sequel as she delves further and further into the survivor identity that Joel has molded her into.A lot has changed since the first game was released in 2013 (!), and Naughty Dog was able to marry recent technological advances with nuanced emotional storytelling in a meaningful fashion. It sounds hyperbolic, but much like a performance in a prestige film or television series, microexpressions and simple acts like lip smacking add a human element to Part II\u00a0in a way that many other games have only tried to accomplish. You know how you start to notice a significant other\u2019s\u00a0idiosyncrasies over time, for better or worse? I experienced that very tangible and human sensation with most of Part II\u2018s cast.Beyond the impressive full-body performances from the cast, credit goes to Last of Us\u00a0boss Neil Druckmann and his co-directors Anthony Newman and Kurt\u00a0Margenau, who really draw the most out of the talent and allow the camera to linger in a way that captures the emotion of each scene. While many moments in the original Last of Us\u00a0were filler-oriented, the sequel\u2019s script is mostly meat. Sometimes scenes are very low key, but those moments actually matter, with dialogue containing themes that echo throughout the story in more subtle ways.The splendor of the environments augments those performances. By resisting the urge to go fully open-world, Naughty Dog was able to meticulously design chapter-based sandboxes, making them feel cohesive, but not overwhelming. Although they\u2019re arguably too linear in some cases (more on that in a moment), the zones often feel like characters themselves given how much personality they exhume. A few of them are absolutely burned in my brain and persist in my mind\u2019s eye long after clearing the campaign. I can see them as clear as day.While that echelon of budget is what you\u2019d expect out of a 2020 first-party production, gameplay-wise, Part II\u00a0doesn\u2019t really provide any surprises, or elevate the survival-action genre. And that\u2019s mostly okay, as this is a character-driven game, even if it gets grating. There\u2019s still lots of scripted moments with NPCs and some light QTEs (mainly mashing while grappling, that sort of non-annoying thing).\u00a0Last of Us Part II\u00a0also seems to have more \u201coh the door is locked, let\u2019s find another way around\u201d moments than any other game I\u2019ve ever played.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5748bc05-fbad-4079-8350-6d8e3b2d3867": {"__data__": {"id_": "5748bc05-fbad-4079-8350-6d8e3b2d3867", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "21a0c46e-192f-4f7e-b22b-686866850b13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "280456e35c804988811940da4407f60bafc66ff4e17311459aa0030c7115ebbe"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8f8a2bb-aebd-4754-81dc-e415bf205748", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c63c96f9b810cd59353a84f96203e1be7df98118ce0f99208554d35c3d9a4f77"}}, "hash": "2917d1cfd2067e17d3f6acdd0b87961281de83f626dc76ab04079a26c6f063b6", "text": "A clear-cut runner-up: portions where you\u2019re strictly running forward, then holding the Triangle button to open a door at the end of a path.Picking up items and crafting them is still tedious given the stringent item limits and slow rate of acquiring new abilities, not to mention the so-so efficacy of some of the early-game items. Limiting ammo is fine as it fits with the post-apocalyptic theme \u2014 but there aren\u2019t a whole lot of new ways to approach situations this time. Even so, it does all come together in the end when you\u2019re actually engaging in stealth or combat. The dodge-heavy melee system is effective because of how brutal and simple it all is, as is the act of sneaking around and causing distractions.I think what Last of Us\u00a0does really well as a series is hammer in the theme that you\u2019re not a superhero, both physically and emotionally. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be a power fantasy (this game is full of believable badasses), but the grounded nature of having to stab people in the neck while they squirm hits home more than most unattached stealth romps. More-so than the initial entry, The Last of Us Part II\u00a0isn\u2019t afraid to get dark, which includes rampant dog-murder.As someone who hasn\u2019t eaten meat in many years, sometimes I find the prospect of even consuming flesh digitally unappealing (don\u2019t freak out, it doesn\u2019t stop me from playing or anything!), so dog killing can be fairly harrowing when it\u2019s sparingly attempted by creatives. You might be freaked out by it, but that\u2019s kind of the point \u2014 and it\u2019s probably going to be the least controversial aspect of\u00a0Part II. Not that it\u2019s that controversial in the first place.You\u2019re going to be freaked out a lot, actually, as Part II maintains a consistent level of tension far more than the original did.\u00a0Part II\u00a0is what I\u2019d call \u201cWorrying: The Game,\u201d as its cast is thrown into the ringer multiple times, with a scant few cheap shock-value moments spliced in (among many that feel earned). Some arcs are rushed, but for the most part, I felt a genuine connection to the main cast and experienced an immense amount of empathy for them. While I won\u2019t spoil the main beats here, suffice to say we will be talking about them soon enough.As a bit of housekeeping, there\u2019s no multiplayer this time: and as far as options and tweaks go,\u00a0Part II\u00a0is one of the most welcoming AAA games to date. There\u2019s a host of accessibility controls, plus you can swap the difficulty at any time. New Game+ (unlocked after one playthrough) allows you to replay the story with upgrades and items in tow, which is a more enticing prospect when you can fully customize the difficulty across multiple options. (You can beef your stats up while making enemies smarter or more perceptive if you don\u2019t like bullet sponges \u2014 bravo.) There\u2019s also a gallery with some great concept art, including a ton of designs that never made it into the game.Like the original Last of Us, some people are going to come away underwhelmed, but the story beats and the characters driving them are the main draw. Part II\u00a0doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel, but it gives us a lasting glimpse of a unique broken world full of broken people that\u2019s worth visiting time and time again.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back.

Joel and Ellie are two of my favorite characters.No, I did not get an early review copy of this game, which frees me up to talk about things like the entire second half of the game which was not allowed before embargo, and I think it\u2019s an absolutely essential core part of the story to discuss.Yes, I have spent the last few days arguing with the entire internet about The Last of Us Part 2, so much so that I am already as exhausted as I was after two years of Last Jedi fighting.But I\u2019m pushing past that now. I\u2019m not going to keep diving into why exactly people are review bombing the game or the mob mentality behind it, all I can do here is explain why I played this game, even having it spoiled in many ways beforehand, and came out the other side loving it. Loving how it handles its old characters, growing and evolving them, loving how it introduces new ones, and loving how the dual perspective narrative makes for a revenge tale that is infinitely more interesting than the \u201ccheck the minibosses and big boss off the list\u201d series of levels that it could have been if it had stuck with Ellie the entire way.This will be a non-traditional review in that I do not think you should read the rest of it until you are at least a little ways into the game. Until you at least get to \u201cthe moment.\u201d You\u2019ll know which one.I have no idea how earlier reviews managed to dance around the entire impetus of the plot for their analysis, but I\u2019m not going to bother with that here, particularly since the game has been out for a few days now, and most players are probably past this point.But yes, spoilers for an event in the first few hours of the game follow.We cannot talk about The Last of Us Part 2 without talking about the brutal death of Joel. It\u2019s a moment that instantly turned off many players from the game, and I\u2019m hearing echoes of \u201cI stopped watching The Walking Dead after Negan beat Glenn\u2019s head in,\u201d right down to essentially the same manner of execution. I get that, but I think you should still keep going.The Last of Us Part 2Ellie and Joel have found a new home in Jackson, a small town that has weathered the apocalypse, and managed to fend off infected and a few unsavory human types as well. But that changes one day when a patrol goes awry. Joel and Tommy, not as distrustful of strangers as perhaps they were four years ago, rescue a woman, Abby, who you play as briefly. But then, once Joel introduces himself, things turn quickly.Abby and her group have been looking for Joel. This specific Joel. For a very long time. They capture him, torture him, and then ultimately, when Ellie finally arrives, Abby beats Joel to death with a golf club right in front of her.It is, unquestionably, heartbreaking. I loved Joel as much as anyone, which is why this moment works so well. You feel Ellie\u2019s pain practically as much as she does, and that need for vengeance carries you through the story.And yet I did not find Joel\u2019s death to be a surprise, as I always figured this was coming.Yes, this moment was indeed spoiled for me during the leaks by some rando on Twitter. If you\u2019re as online as me, that was always going to be impossible to avoid for an entire month once the major leaks were disseminated.But past that, even from the first trailer, it seemed very clear that something had broken Ellie and she was going on a murderous rampage of vengeance. What else would have possibly happened to make her that angry besides some group killing Joel?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d31361f-3af8-4531-9f75-737b98da0290": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d31361f-3af8-4531-9f75-737b98da0290", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "b8f8a2bb-aebd-4754-81dc-e415bf205748", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c63c96f9b810cd59353a84f96203e1be7df98118ce0f99208554d35c3d9a4f77"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa473888-6b21-45c0-9b48-e0581a10fe44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2045e6cb54d00bbb9fea78660857ff1b09acef2d0f6338f3238f8ae3ffea4950"}}, "hash": "2e5ea817bd69073ca72ab57b49f52fd62f31c486aaeef35ba66ce191f69e7872", "text": "What else would have possibly happened to make her that angry besides some group killing Joel? Yes, the trailers tried to show Joel was alive, but back then I explained it away as him possibly being in her head. That isn\u2019t what happens, but that footage is either from scenes before his death, flashbacks that happen after, or it was plainly doctored to throw people off (I did not love that tactic, in hindsight).The Last of Us Part 2I also remember that Joel did something that could easily be considered monstrous, murdered an entire hospital of people looking for a cure for the virus so he could save Ellie. It\u2019s one of the most complicated moral decisions presented in a game, a decision that, mind you, the game did not actually let you make. This was Joel\u2019s story. This was no ending you got to choose. It happened to you, and ultimately, through you, with the controller in your hand. The only way to avoid it was to shut the game off.People complain that Joel\u2019s death was \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cpointless,\u201d and he should have gone out like a hero saving Ellie. But don\u2019t you get it? He did die saving Ellie, just four years after he probably should have.Again, after this point, I was expecting a pretty stock tale of revenge. First, Tommy leaves, heading to Seattle to take on this \u201cWashington Liberation Front\u201d group, the ones who killed Joel. Ellie, and her new girlfriend Dina, follow shortly thereafter, and we get the fairly traditional \u201chunt down everyone who was present\u201d structure, ultimately leading to Abby, the obvious \u201cfinal boss.\u201d But The Last of Us Part 2 is not content with that story. Not even close.I\u2019ll pause the plotlines here for a minute to focus on Ellie\u2019s actual gameplay as she explores Seattle. If The Last of Us suffers anywhere, it\u2019s probably in some aspects of it\u2026actually being a video game. Contrary to many fan opinions, I think the story is the strongest part of the game, followed by the performances and the sheer majesty of these digital environments that Naughty Dog (and its painfully overworked employees) have crafted here. It\u2019s one of the most beautiful games I\u2019ve ever seen, which is exactly what I said about Uncharted 4. And The Last of Us Part 1. And Uncharted 3. And so on. You get it, this is kind of Naughty Dog\u2019s thing. But it never, ever fails to impress.Ellie pairs with various characters on her journey, sometimes Dina, sometimes others, though occasionally, she\u2019s alone. When that happens, you miss the banter and the game is at its darkest. And sometimes dullest.Very, very little has evolved in terms of actual gameplay and mechanics here. The control scheme is definitely one of the most bizarre I\u2019ve ever experienced in a game (R2 to reload? What?) but you get used to it eventually. I\u2019d say Ellie controls less like a boat than Joel did, but the game is generous making its AI rather dumb and allowing you to silently kill an entire room of bad guys with your switchblade. I think combat is enjoyable enough, a mad scramble between stealth and loud, often incredibly brutal action, but at times I almost felt the game was far too easy on normal, and enemies lost your trail way too quickly if you fled even a short distance away. Even the new \u201cdogs track your scent\u201d mechanic doesn\u2019t really do much other than make you feel extremely bad about killing dogs.The Last of Us Part 2I also still hate every single infected encounter in the game, like I did in the original, and tried to just blitz through them as fast as possible. The one exception was a cool infected boss fight way late into the game that I was not expecting, which was the only genuinely fun moment I\u2019ve ever experienced with this series\u2019 cursed mushroom zombies.I like the exploring, to a point. The game does make you feel like you need to search every nook and cranny, but it starts feeling a bit arduous the longer the game goes on. And it\u2019s a very long game. There are select moments that you can trigger with exploration that are story relevant (one of the most touching bits of the game is a Dina/Ellie interaction early on that takes place in a random building you could easily miss), but later, this kind of stops happening and you\u2019re just finding endless rolls of duct tape and single bullets sitting on tables.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa473888-6b21-45c0-9b48-e0581a10fe44": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa473888-6b21-45c0-9b48-e0581a10fe44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d31361f-3af8-4531-9f75-737b98da0290", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5ea817bd69073ca72ab57b49f52fd62f31c486aaeef35ba66ce191f69e7872"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a668372-d4d0-4048-8ef5-f762cfdfde54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "58fa0727c23ecadf9d4ee63a907475615cbc6065f63f70ed9a4e2f65a66838f6"}}, "hash": "2045e6cb54d00bbb9fea78660857ff1b09acef2d0f6338f3238f8ae3ffea4950", "text": "Like the first game, these sequences, whether it\u2019s finding long, long ways around to locked doors, or trekking toward some giant landmark in the distance, can feel too long. I am not saying this game should not have gameplay, but there are many, many sequences that feel like they should be a lot tighter, like you\u2019re reading a 1,500 page book or watching a five hour movie. Some editing would have worked well in some of these sections.But ultimately, yes, the game is fun to play. The environment design alone makes exploration worthwhile, however plodding it may become. And there\u2019s nothing more gratifying than having a 5\u20194\u201d girl take down a room full of lunatic cult members with two arrows, three revolver rounds and a brick.The violence\u2026is violent. I understand that it may be a turn off to some, and if Naughty Dog\u2019s signature is realism, that translates not just to environments and performance capture, but also its brutality. As someone who has been watching the goriest horror and action movies and shows in history for a few decades now, this didn\u2019t really phase me. The lone exception was the dogs\u2026which definitely made me wince. Yes, attack dogs have been enemies in video games before, but again, those encounters have never been this realistic, and that whimpering and whining and howling of brutally murdered German Shepherds will haunt my dreams.The Last of Us Part 2All in all, I feel almost identical about The Last of Us 2\u2019s gameplay as I did the first game. It\u2019s beautiful and brutal, but enemy AI, both human and infected, is not the best, and the pacing has its problems. And yet I loved the writing and characters and story so much all of that doesn\u2019t really end up mattering all that much to me.Now we reach the turn, when we figure out that we\u2019re not just playing as the Joel-murderer Abby for a brief segment, but rather, close to half the game. I\u2019m talking a new skill tree, a new style of gameplay (while Abby can be stealthy like Ellie, she is usually better off plowing through people like a truck). And an entirely new perspective on not just this game, but the last one, too.I will stop short of getting into further spoilers here, as these happen late into the game, rather than Joel\u2019s death which is at the beginning. I know that many people disliked playing as Abby in a game they thought they would just be switching between Joel and Ellie again. And much less playing as a character that murdered the character they wanted to be playing as.But I found it fascinating. Did I like Abby as much as Joel and Ellie by the end? Maybe not, but that wasn\u2019t the goal. The point was to show that revenge stories are complicated, and often, never-ending and deeply unsatisfying. Some people just want Ellie to be John Wick and murder everyone who wronged her without a second thought. But The Last of Us 2 wants to see that Ellie\u2019s \u201cminibosses\u201d are actual people, Abby\u2019s friends. And if we\u2019re going with the John Wick comparison, Abby\u2019s the one whose dog gets murdered.It is not easy to confront the idea that the characters you have grown to love may not be good people. That was pretty clear in the last game with Joel\u2019s hospital murder spree. Whether you want to justify that or not, it\u2019s still brutal and highly debatable, given that it\u2019s not just the Fireflies he killed, but potentially millions who could have benefited from a potential cure.But you\u2019re also meant to question Ellie\u2019s actions here, too. We are so used to just cutting through legions of bad guys in video games that we\u2019re stunned when a game bothers to show us the other side. We don\u2019t like it, it makes us uncomfortable. And yet by the end of the game, you should at least be able to appreciate the perspective that in Abby\u2019s story, Joel and Ellie are the clear villains. And in Ellie\u2019s case in particular, we have a new moral question, whether killing dozens, hundreds of people is worth seeking revenge for one man, a man who did do something who hurt a lot of people. Many players will scream \u201chell yes!\u201d and cut through them all with glee.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a668372-d4d0-4048-8ef5-f762cfdfde54": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a668372-d4d0-4048-8ef5-f762cfdfde54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa473888-6b21-45c0-9b48-e0581a10fe44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2045e6cb54d00bbb9fea78660857ff1b09acef2d0f6338f3238f8ae3ffea4950"}, "3": {"node_id": "802f5a1c-3071-4e58-9eb1-7d72c200917d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6db646bd33d9c7beecb00706e17912b779597ef5fb3139f6ae7f8d55ebb7dac"}}, "hash": "58fa0727c23ecadf9d4ee63a907475615cbc6065f63f70ed9a4e2f65a66838f6", "text": "But I think the Abby storyline is what saves this game from being way, way too predictable and like every single other revenge tale out there, even though no, I don\u2019t think the point is to make her out to be a hero either.The Last of Us Part 2The ending, which I won\u2019t fully get into, has been criticized as \u201cunsatisfying.\u201d For me, it\u2019s really the only way it could have ended. This entire game is a commentary on moral relativism (what I see as right and justified, you see as wrong and abominable), and the circular nature of vengeance (\u201cBefore you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves\u201d). The ending, from that perspective, works. It\u2019s kind of perfect, actually.This is a great game. One of the best I\u2019ve played in years. No, I\u2019m not going to go into GOTY nonsense in June, and no, I won\u2019t be one of the 50 outlets giving it a perfect score, even though yes, I do believe you can give imperfect games 10/10s, given that nothing is completely without flaws. But The Last of Us 2\u2019 actual gameplay leaves enough to be desired for me to take it out of contention for that.But it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s important. And it\u2019s a deeply well-told story to the point where I genuinely cannot fathom why anyone who has fully beaten the game, not just heard the spoilers, not just watched a streamer snark their way through it or watched ripped YouTube cutscenes, doesn\u2019t appreciate what it has achieved here. But again, I can only offer my own opinion and my own defense of what I think is a must-play as a huge fan of the original, even as someone who loved the characters they\u2019ve murdered and maimed and morally compromised here. It\u2019s remarkable, and it will stay with me a long while, just like the first.Platform: PlayStation 4Developer: Naughty DogPublisher: Sony InteractiveReleased: June 19, 2020Price: $59.99Review Score: 9.5 out of 10\nShacknews, New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowThe Last of Us Part 2 takes players back into the brutal, post-apocalyptic world that Naughty Dog first introduced in 2013. Is this sequel worth checking out, or do the notes fall flat? Our review.Have you ever heard a song that strikes you down deep? Each note that\u2019s played upon the guitar strings and piano keys a haunting sound that reverberates in your mind for days, weeks, or even years to come. The Last of Us Part 2 is that song. A series of notes and chords struck perfectly together. Poignant narrative, brutal violence, and a bleak but realistic look at humanity all swirl together into a rippling tide that pulls the player under; constantly tossing and turning until it all reaches a dark and roaring crescendo.The Last of Us Part 2 picks up immediately after the events of the original, as Joel explains how he butchered dozens of Fireflies, and dashed Ellie\u2019s hopes of curing the infection just to save her life. It\u2019s a retelling of a very selfish tale, and one that will no doubt continue to haunt both he and Ellie for the rest of their lives.Fast forward a few years. It\u2019s now been five years since Ellie and Joel returned to Jackson and set up camp in the settlement that Joel\u2019s brother, Tommy, helped create. They\u2019ve both found their own places within the community, and they\u2019ve been doing the best they can to put the events from Saint Mary\u2019s Hospital behind them. Things seem to be going pretty well for our beloved survivors. Joel and Ellie have grown closer, despite the secrets between them, and Ellie has even managed to make some friends along the way.Unfortunately, peace doesn\u2019t last forever, and The Last of Us Part 2 is not a happy story. Soon Ellie and Joel find themselves thrust under the surface of a cruel and stormy sea, a dark and unrelenting riptide pulling at their feet. It\u2019s a beautifully executed event that helps to shape the growth of multiple characters throughout the rest of the game.I\u2019m not going to talk too in-depth about the story. There\u2019s already been a ton of rumors and leaks, and I\u2019m not going to add onto that pile. What I will say about the story is that there are things you won\u2019t expect.

There are a lot of things that don\u2019t always make sense the first time you see them, but it all comes together in the end. You might not like everything that happens, or the consequences that come up throughout the story, but I assure you it all plays out in one of the most cinematic and beautifully haunting experiences we\u2019ve seen offered in a video game. Ever.One of the most striking things about Naughty Dog\u2019s post-apocalyptic series is the developer\u2019s approach to violence and overall brutality. While the original had quite a bit of this brutality on display, the second chapter of Ellie and Joel\u2019s story takes things up a notch, and then continues to turn the dial even higher. Stealth assassinations sound and feel realistic, offering a dark and bleak look at how our character\u2019s approach their problems.The screams of infected and soldiers as the flesh burns from their bodies, the yelps from enemies as they watch their friends and allies die next to them, it all comes together in a nice package that helps to paint a bleak but realistic look at the end of the world. From the way the cities have begun to return to nature, dark green leaves painting entire sides of buildings in Seattle as you explore, the earth engulfing the world that mankind once thought it mastered.It's a dark and yet beautiful look at how things could be if something of that sort happened, and the upgraded visuals that Naughty Dog has on display in The Last of Us Part 2 only help to strike that beauty home. Each thing comes together like a different instrument in an orchestra, all working cohesively to tell a story through sound. It\u2019s beautiful and yet disturbing to watch the way that humans destroy each other as Ellie takes on members of the Washington Liberation Front (often referred to as the WLF) and the Seraphites. \u00a0While the idea of two factions might not be very enticing to some players, each group offers their own challenges and different looks at the world that Ellie, Joel, and their friends inhabit. Whereas the WLF see the world as their oyster, a force that they can brutally beat into submission, the Seraphites work in more deceptive ways, using quiet attacks and vegetation to wreak havoc on their enemies. It all works together to showcase just how violent the world is.The combat system featured in the original returns, focusing heavily on cover and stealth as your main means of taking down enemies, though it is a bit more refined here. Of course, ammo is scarce in most instances, and while you\u2019re more than welcome to run in shooting, the ability to craft items like arrows and smoke bombs open new avenues to take out baddies without alerting others in the area. But be careful, taking out an enemy might cause one of their friends to come looking for them.Arrows shot at you will stick into your body at times, forcing you to remove them or slowly bleed out. Shotgun blasts rip chunks from your enemies\u2019 bodies, sending blood, bone, and flesh spewing across the walls and floors. Rounds from your rifle leave holes in the heads of your foes. Each shot feels like a hammer slamming down, granting the combat a nice chunky feeling that many other games fail to full deliver.Much like the original, The Last of Us Part 2 also has a much bigger story to tell than just Ellie and Joel\u2019s. Notes left behind by survivors and soldiers tell of how wars and combat have changed them. Some notes connect to each other, telling a long and cohesive narrative as you move further through the game. It\u2019s a really great touch that helps to make the world feel even more alive than it already does.That\u2019s where the next big focus of the game comes into play. Where the original took more of a linear approach to storytelling and world exploration, The Last of Us Part 2 rewards players for looking in every dark cranny they come across. Safes, pieces of lore, and collectibles are abundant throughout the world, sometimes hidden in areas you might not think to explore the first time you look around at the new areas you enter.Long grass and tight hallways give way to new rooms that Ellie can use to get around enemies and conserve ammunition, though sometimes the game does thrust you directly into firefights without any way to avoid them. These moments are few and far between, and Naughty Dog has done a great job of making these instances feel less jarring to the player.From enemy bases to abandoned music shops, there are tons of environments to explore and navigate in The Last of Us Part 2. Each one is detailed and feels unique as you move through them, really helping to paint the picture that this is indeed a living, breathing world that the player is inhabiting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4d3d0bc-c222-4ac5-b553-7c9354c77622": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4d3d0bc-c222-4ac5-b553-7c9354c77622", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "802f5a1c-3071-4e58-9eb1-7d72c200917d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6db646bd33d9c7beecb00706e17912b779597ef5fb3139f6ae7f8d55ebb7dac"}, "3": {"node_id": "60e49501-72a1-44d4-adfd-24048d225182", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06b1c927865a7dffe655f79fe8abcfe45030ed4b3763c20f663c7df13a1c37f3"}}, "hash": "1d6d6510ade584bec209099cb402bb65349b5c5d92795848acbf31cc85d7c759", "text": "Unfortunately, this living, breathing world does come at a cost, and there were a few instances where triggered events wouldn't pick up correctly, forcing me to reload the save file to the nearest checkpoint to get things to click just right.Naughty Dog continues to build onto the world design by enveloping the player in a beautifully designed soundscape. The rush of wind moving past your head, the whiz of arrows raining down on you as you move from cover to cover, it all fits so well within the world. Glass crunches under your feet as you walk across it, the sound of running feet echoing through the dark corridors littered with infected. The sound design helps to paint a disturbing and haunting picture.Atmosphere isn\u2019t the only sound design on display, though. As mentioned earlier in the review, the sounds that enemies make as they die, the gurgling of their blood in their throats as Ellie lodges her Switchblade deep within their necks, it all adds to the brutality that permeates the air in The Last of Us Part 2. This is a savage world, and recent events have shaped the previously innocent girl from the original game into a dark and disturbed mess. But her actions are not absolute. Her actions come with consequences, and as you dive deeper into the story, Ellie finds herself struggling more and more to face the reflection in the dirty windows that litter the abandoned Seattle storefronts.The Last of Us Part 2 is not for everyone. It is a dark and riveting experiment. A symphony of madness, revenge, and brutality. It is the song of humanity\u2019s greatest darkness, and an absolute delight to partake in. The fine folks at Naughty Dog have outdone themselves this time around. The clever blend of cinematics and gameplay all come together perfectly to create an unforgettable experience that rivals some of the greatest classics in American cinema. All that\u2019s left to do now is see it for yourself.This review is based on a code provided by the publisher.

The gripping, tightly paced, very human tale told by the first game is an almost perfect example of self-contained video game storytelling. That game\u2019s ending\u2014where the \u201chero\u201d condemns the world to continuing disaster out of love for a companion he has slowly grown to love like a daughter, all while betraying her wishes and shielding her from the truth\u2014is a deeply affecting and thought-provoking moment that has resonated with gamers for seven years now. The idea of adding anything to that quietly confident, freestanding narrative package feels superfluous at best and gratuitous at worst.Things pick up four years after the events of the first game in the amazingly calm settlement of Jackson, Wyoming. After the almost overwhelming death and decay of the first game, it\u2019s a shock to be thrown into a thriving community full of electricity, commerce, gossip, food and drink, and even happily playing children. Small groups still regularly patrol the perimeter to keep the Infected at bay, but humanity, it seems, has gained a bucolic foothold.Ars tested the game on a PS4 Pro, which often whirred like a jet engine to keep up. Everything looks great in HDR, with high contrast lighting effects that shine especially well when you're using the flashlight in otherwise dark areas.In our playthrough, the game\u2019s frame rate stuttered noticeably in a few busy scenes, but not enough to be a major hindrance. The game also crashed a couple of times during my roughly 25 hours of play time, but frequent and automatic checkpointing made this barely a nuisance (and post-release patches may fix some stability issues).The sense of a slowly returning normalcy is made all the more bittersweet because we know Ellie is fated not to enjoy it for long. The Ellie we see here is no longer the sweet, energetic, eager pre-adolescent who forged an endearing bond with gruff Joel through the first game, either. Time and knowledge have made her harder, more reserved, and more unforgiving than ever. By the time external circumstances and a drive for vengeance force her out of the comfort of Jackson and into a dangerous, murderous trek to Seattle, it\u2019s not exactly a surprise.We do get occasional glimpses of the old Ellie, especially when she\u2019s taking her first tentative steps into a truly adult relationship. Love interest Dina is a gently teasing foil for Ellie\u2019s developing affections here, and their extended casual banter during the trip to Seattle brings to mind some of the best bonding moments between Ellie and Joel in the last game.These conversations take place amid the beautiful desolation of a city that has quickly been retaken by the nature surrounding it\u2014a \u201cNature is healing\u201d meme made vividly real. The environmental design in Part 2 is top notch, with every single location feeling like an actual, inhabited place that was fully built and then slowly left to rot.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29fa1237-5bf1-4fa5-9653-a33fab790697": {"__data__": {"id_": "29fa1237-5bf1-4fa5-9653-a33fab790697", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "60e49501-72a1-44d4-adfd-24048d225182", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "06b1c927865a7dffe655f79fe8abcfe45030ed4b3763c20f663c7df13a1c37f3"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d35c78d-6b26-41ac-b9ed-e5a78ce05653", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6028d6ae03cf257d13abd1833d002fccbfc922478c415791f4f45858e6087d23"}}, "hash": "916483e0d055dcc92a2757b7285ec652ea4ffa2d7eac45d05c6722f308f84b8c", "text": "I could aimlessly wander the beautiful desolation for hours, picking out ominous touches of environmental storytelling even if I wasn\u2019t scrounging for materials to ensure my in-game survival.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

If humanity can\u2019t unite, these eyeless horrors will inherit the Earth.The Last of Us is a character study of a smuggler and a survivor - Joel and Ellie - trekking across post-apocalyptic America. The original game opened with Joel\u2019s daughter being killed, and he carries the guilt of being unable to save her across the US with him as emotional baggage. He offloads that baggage onto Ellie, a teenager who\u2019s immune to the outbreak - his self-appointed surrogate daughter. By the end they share a Stockholm Syndrome-esque affection, bonded through shared trauma.\n\nOnce they reach the Fireflies - a group who claim they can fashion a cure from Ellie\u2019s DNA - Joel discovers the procedure will kill her. He assaults the hospital, guns down the surgeons, and escapes with Ellie still sedated. When she wakes, he says they just ran some tests and discharged her. He lies. The Last of Us Part 2 deals with the consequences of both the killings and the lie.Fans of the original might be concerned that forcing a story with such a perfect ending to continue would tarnish the original\u2019s legacy. Fortunately, that isn\u2019t the case. This is a companion piece that manages to introduce new characters and themes while also making the original story stronger simply by existing. Conversations that you\u2019ve forgotten take on new meaning, beloved characters become more nuanced. When it ends, it imprints the same satisfaction of a story well told, packaged within Naughty Dog\u2019s best game.It opens with Joel talking to his brother, Tommy. \u201cI saved her,\u201d he says as the camera cuts to a bloody hospital corridor filled with bodies. Three syllables explain how Joel justifies himself. He didn\u2019t kill them, he rescued Ellie. But he stripped away her agency, and he knows he\u2019s no hero.Where the original game opened with explosions, this prologue is more understated, poignant. It\u2019s a story about facing the consequences of your actions, how everyone finds their inner strength in a different place, and how revenge can spiral out of control until you lose everything.We play as Ellie four years on from the lie, living some semblance of a normal life in the walled town of Jackson. Joel occasionally visits her cabin to tell her dad jokes. She listens to music on a cassette player, and a lava lamp bubbles away on her desk. Sketches and posters litter the walls of her room. In Joel\u2019s cabin, there\u2019s woodwork tables, wooden carvings, and family photos. On his bedside table sits a pair of reading glasses and a book, An Idiot\u2019s Guide to Space - his way of attempting to rekindle their paternal relationship. The world is stuffed with little details like this that enrich the story and reward your curiosity.It is the morning after the winter dance and Ellie's getting ready for patrol. She gets her backpack, grabs her pistol, and cocks the slider with a yawn. She doesn\u2019t curse under her breath when people get curb stomped anymore - violence is normalised, and this is just an ordinary day. Until it isn\u2019t.The main story takes place over three days, as opposed to the four seasons structure of the original.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d35c78d-6b26-41ac-b9ed-e5a78ce05653": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d35c78d-6b26-41ac-b9ed-e5a78ce05653", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "29fa1237-5bf1-4fa5-9653-a33fab790697", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "916483e0d055dcc92a2757b7285ec652ea4ffa2d7eac45d05c6722f308f84b8c"}, "3": {"node_id": "31af84ce-bdc8-44b2-b935-27880b637eba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b78fe90b2162321a41ea108bc60bcf280fc42b0e8a6759103106be562f890573"}}, "hash": "6028d6ae03cf257d13abd1833d002fccbfc922478c415791f4f45858e6087d23", "text": "At the same time, it jumps back and forth from the past to the present, introducing characters you initially hate before making you fall in love with them. It manages to be hopeful, bleak, funny, sad, peaceful, and frightening, running the gamut of human emotion, but masterfully paced out so you\u2019re never overwhelmed.Every character is complex and human. It might be Naughty Dog\u2019s biggest game, but it\u2019s the studio\u2019s leanest script - you\u2019re trusted to understand subtext. The dialogue has an almost surgical precision to it. It also does things I\u2019ve never seen before, in ways only video games can. It is a generation-defining masterpiece.There\u2019s a structural pattern that\u2019s similar to other Naughty Dog games, of course. You see a landmark, you head towards it, and you have pockets of adventure along the way. There are hub-style areas where you can explore optional buildings around Seattle, but the majority of the game is linear - tailored maps with multiple routes through ruined buildings, via underground train stations, and lush, overgrown parks. There\u2019s surprising variety to the places you visit, though, and a strong sense of discovery, awe, and exploration, despite that linearity.There are tense stealth sections, huge battles, blood-curdling horror scenes, exciting chase sequences, three-way conflicts, moments of quiet exploration, and even environmental puzzles that aren\u2019t just based on carrying ladders around.It builds slowly - it is hours before you fight any humans - with relationships and character growth at the fore. You pick through buildings and see the ghost of a world that\u2019s alien to these young survivors, scavenging for supplies, ignoring the whiteboards filled with pitch-meeting notes and profit forecasts. It earns its action and that lends it more impact as a result.Things ramp up in intensity as the story goes on, but it\u2019s interspersed with those aforementioned flashbacks. These give you room to breathe when the main story is going full throttle. In one, you explore a museum with Joel and Ellie. There\u2019s no combat, just two characters bonding as you interact with props. It\u2019s one of my favourite sequences in a game ever, and lands harder than any virtual bullet.It\u2019s not something I expected going in, but The Last of Us Part 2 reminds me of Metal Gear Solid 5 mechanically. You spend much of the game laid prone in the grass, slithering between patrol routes. You cut through and around buildings, slip through small gaps, and hide under trucks and trains. It\u2019s stealth that\u2019s designed to keep you moving, to keep you reacting and improvising, to keep you clenching your jaw - and not just because you don\u2019t want a bloater to rip it off.Level design is Naughty Dog\u2019s best, each encounter offering multiple routes and opportunities for stealth, action, and a blend of the two. You\u2019re constantly segueing in and out of stealth as you pick off enemies with guerrilla tactics. It makes you feel like a deadly hunter one minute and timid prey the next. The AI coordinates, using vantage points and pincer tactics, flanking and flushing out: they pull you by a leg as you hide underneath a truck; they sweep buildings like a SWAT team. It\u2019s more dynamic than the original - unpredictable and exciting.In one scene, the two main enemy factions are fighting, one side standing in the flooded streets and the other in a ruined building overlooking the open space. I park my boat and crawl, fully submerged, through the knee-high water. The Seraphites, a group of religious fanatics who communicate via whistles (which are somehow more unnerving than the echo-location clicks from an infected) are winning. They\u2019re raining down molotov cocktails on the WLF (or Wolves) below. Covered by the screams, I crawl onto a waterlogged bank, pull out my rifle, and take aim at a Seraphite through my scope. I pull the trigger and skull fragments explode from the back of his head, alerting the others.As I continue picking them off, I\u2019m distracted by nearby splashing so I pull my eye from the scope to see two of them swimming at me, one from each side. I switch to my shotgun and take one of their heads off, using the last remaining shell to rip the leg from my other attacker. From the building, I hear their allies screaming their names.When I first played The Last of Us Part 2, I misunderstood the intent behind this.

Good and evil is a matter of perspective in a lawless world where people act on survival instinct. It\u2019s holistic - gameplay and story in harmony. Even a minigame where you pluck at the strings of a fully functional guitar serves a purpose in the larger tale.Every mechanic and story beat reinforces the themes. Combat is scrappy and messy. Incoming shots sometimes knock you onto your back where you\u2019re free to return fire in a desperate effort. In one scene, Ellie kills someone who\u2019s playing Hotline Miami on a PS Vita. She looks so ordinary, but she attacks you. It\u2019s self defense. The next minute she\u2019s bleeding out on the floor as the music from her portable console rings out. It\u2019s fitting, because the aftermath of each battle reminded me of Dennaton Games\u2019 indie hit.Hotline Miami features a repeating cycle of top-down violence punctuated by a slow walk back through that carnage, over bodies and through corridors painted in blood. It wordlessly asks you to reflect on your violent deeds.Here that same feeling translates to a 3D, photorealistic scene. Bodies lay limp with jaws ripped from their face, teeth missing, blood spilling from the exit wound. Shoot someone with an explosive arrow indoors and a chunk of flesh might stick to the ceiling and drip down in the aftermath - a thick splash of liquid and unidentifiable body parts where a human once stood. Shoot someone in the throat and they die with a gargle, bleeding out and twitching as blood pools around them. It\u2019s horrific, but it all works together to create a mood of unease.The brilliant acting makes everything land harder. When the characters cry out, you feel it. When they say one thing and mean another, you get it. Every little facial tic, every shaking hand - Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, Ian Alexander, and Shannon Woodward all put in the performances of a lifetime, but even most of the side characters leave a lasting impression.When the credits rolled on The Last of Us Part 2 I was still buzzing from the excitement of the final few hours. My loyalty shifted between characters. I grew to love who I hated and dislike who I loved. I laughed, I teared up. I felt anger and elation. It\u2019s the new high water mark for video game characters and I can\u2019t wait for everyone to see just how special it is. As soon as it ended, I booted up New Game Plus and I\u2019m experiencing it again with my eyes open, the context of the finished story imprinting new meaning into those early scenes and characters. I\u2019m not swiping in the dark anymore.Version tested: PS4 Pro - a review copy was provided by Sony. \n        Sign in and unlock a world of features\n      \n        Get access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nKirk McKeand\n\n          Contributor\n        \nPlease enable JavaScript to see comments.      \n\nEven The Last of Us developer, Naughty Dog, can\u2019t avoid cutting back development in 2023                    \n\n\nWHAT AN ACT\n\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 proves David Cage right about LA Noire                    \n\n\nNoted\n\n\nThe Last of Us Part 2's composer may have confirmed the game is getting a new release", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aafb6420-20c9-4a9c-819e-b43923d4ae5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "aafb6420-20c9-4a9c-819e-b43923d4ae5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8ac5e7e-2605-4189-bd04-fd7ef11aa252", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d00567068c37b17c108cef68640c02172caf851c4354ad66a53c51a4ef05972"}, "2": {"node_id": "31af84ce-bdc8-44b2-b935-27880b637eba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b78fe90b2162321a41ea108bc60bcf280fc42b0e8a6759103106be562f890573"}}, "hash": "873d1208c951315ac757b4ab577dcbad2c9816caadaf0ea9248ba725d60b78c1", "text": "The Last of Us 2 safe codes and combinations - all safe locations                    \n\n\nLasting Impact\n\n\nBungie reportedly expressed concerns over how engaging The Last of Us multiplayer project was                    \n\n\nPlay It By Year\n\n\nThe Last of Us season 2 should arrive \"end of 2024, early 2025\" says Bella Ramsey                    \n\n\nPart 2, Part A\n\n\nThe Last of Us Part 2 won't be condensed into just one season                    \n\n\nNaughty Dog is holding off on announcing its next game to encourage a better work-life balance                    \n\n\nTEXTBOOK BOONDOGGLE\n\n\nAlan Wake 2 review: The best psychological horror game I\u2019ve played in generations                    \n\n\nGOTTA RUN\n\n\nGhostrunner 2 review: an imperfect game that understands the rule of cool                    \n\n\nLIQUID'S IN\n\n\nMetal Gear Solid Master Collection (Vol 1) review: A soft collection of solid games                    \n\n\nSHOTS MISSED\n\n\nLords of the Fallen review: fertile ground for a sequel, but leaves a lot to be desired                    \n\n\nCITY PERFORMANCE\n\n\nCities Skylines 2 review: a solid foundation for a spec-hungry future classic                    \n\n\nTUSKMASTER\n\n\nSuper Mario Bros.
