I've kneed the underside of my desk too many times to count from tensing up. My hands are soft from sweating and my knuckles crack when I try to make a fist. Doom Eternal is a celebration of excess. Excess in sin, in violence, scale, speed, and volume. I've never played a shooter this intense and demanding.\u00a0Doom Eternal also runs beautifully on a wide range of hardware and feels designed for a mouse and keyboard first. It's a modern classic, with a few caveats. Cheap deaths from getting stuck on geometry happen too often. There are six or seven layers of unnecessary progression. Doom's dark humor has mostly been traded in for deep lore and a high-fantasy cosmology. And the strain from a heavy focus on resource management is felt at every difficulty level. I worry that for some, it could be Doom: But Too Much.\u00a0But \"too much\" works for me as Eternal's guiding light. The moment to moment combat is distilled panic rather than empowerment. I live for the fleeting moments my head gets above water within the hurricane of light and noise and extravagant violence, and I pull off a feat of accuracy and reflex I never thought I was capable of before.\u00a0Doom Eternal is a tough teacher. A few hours in I'm getting by just fine, juggling half a dozen weapons, belching fire on the hordes to spawn armor to stay afloat, tossing grenades at every opportunity to stun and soften up the crowd. I'm dashing in and out of the action for the occasional Glory Kill to keep my health topped off, dodging projectiles and managing the arena, deciding, between breaths if I remember to breathe, which demons to attack based on who's currently kicking my ass the most.\u00a0Late into the fight a marauder appears. This guy has an axe, a shield, and only opens up to damage if you counter a specific attack with a precisely timed gunshot. Blasting it with a rocket barrage does absolutely nothing. With this enemy design, Doom is asking me to stop shooting and moving so much. It's playing with the comfort zone I've built over decades of playing arena shooters. Now I have to let up on the trigger, to circle-strafe and assume the calm restraint of a Dark Souls duel. I hate this enemy at first, but then I get the hang of it after a dozen or so attempts.\u00a0I've been playing these shooters since I was a teen. But Eternal isn't just asking me to get intimate with my keyboard's number row, it's challenging me to change playstyles in the middle of a classic Doom arena fight, to stop doing boxing and start doing judo. Managing resources, switching weapons, staying on the move, prioritizing demons based on the arena shape and current threat is plenty to juggle for most people, but Doom Eternal makes you change age-old habits too.Doom's guns aren't as subject to this complexity. The old gang is back again. Hello, combat shotgun. Hello, plasma rifle. Hello, BFG. With more opportunities to refill ammunition and heaps more arenas with ways to get airborne, the previously underutilized ballista gets heavy use as a railgun stand-in and stylish airborne demon deletion tool.\u00a0Updated viewmodels reinforce each weapon's heft and sheen, and the gun skins rewarded for completing certain milestones are weird, but not unwelcome in a singleplayer game. Refined reload and firing animations imbue each with a sense of mechanical realism, especially the alternate firing modes, which have way more utility this time. But the guns haven't lost the fundamental character they had in Doom 2016. The big changes in Doom Eternal are in how it handles resource management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5602ce62-a371-4bef-a569-286d9e47a2f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5602ce62-a371-4bef-a569-286d9e47a2f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2c82c1d-af90-4b9f-bf47-5d82f0aa56df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c63deef05e76d6223b54444d37ba444e4946a26bab0aaad2104c5669a26ec4a5"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0847f81-a887-476b-8354-e6bcdab0995f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0cc7b3d8765af8d69e5e8425a658ea451817f77879bb4820c2ed9cdf59798bf8"}}, "hash": "c67d6023878e38937c3a47f417931c208ccb46bb8885bfef8c49854fbe7a491c", "text": "The big changes in Doom Eternal are in how it handles resource management.\u00a0Farming armor from the same guy I'm dueling creates a give-and-take with enemies that isn't present in other shooters.Glory Kills still reward health for staggering a demon and finishing them with a special melee kill animation, but chainsaw kills, which drop ammo, are far more important for keeping your guns fed. Burning through every bullet takes very little time. Throw in the flame belch, a tool that lights demons on fire to make them puke up armor for a bit, and suddenly half of each fight becomes about juggling resources. I regularly had to dip out of Marauder fights to chase down a stray demon for ammo or health.\u00a0Making your enemies your life-saving resources contributes to the overbearing tension of Doom Eternal. Chasing demons into a dangerously tight space normally isn't a great idea, except when it's the setup for a quick flame belch followed by a grenade or rocket. Every stray imp is a potential ammo cache, so keeping a few around just in case is a good plan, so long as you're willing to pay the annoying fireball tax. You have to confront these guys to stay alive, and it's rarely on your own terms.It was all overwhelming at first, frustrating second, and then suddenly novel and exciting. Yes, it makes zero sense that you light monsters on fire in order to get them to drop armor shards. But oddities like this feed into an exhausting, anxiety-inducing, thrilling-once-you-get-it vibe, and farming armor from the same guy I'm dueling creates a give-and-take with enemies that isn't present in other shooters.These more unfamiliar ideas could do with a bit more onboarding, and Eternal's current solution of spelling out how to beat every new demon (even bosses!) with on-screen explainers isn't exactly elegant. Trial and error is essential to Eternal's learning curve, which wasn't the greatest way to acclimate myself to the new ideas and systems introduced throughout its 15-hour runtime.But the ideas settle easier if you're packing any Extra Lives, literal old-timey 1UPs hidden around each level that keep the momentum going with an instant respawn. I only wish they weren't automatically spent with death, since I lost plenty from stupid mistakes. A prompt would be nice, because Doom Eternal's fights get larger, more complex, and more challenging than ever. I died so, so much. Turns out there are still plenty of novel ways to push my pointing and clicking skills.\u00a0I wanted to spend more time soaking in Eternal's incredible settings rather than just shooting and dashing my way through them.Doom Eternal release date: Everything we know\nDoom Eternal tips: Weather the steep difficulty curve\nDoom Eternal Slayer Keys: Unlock the optional encounters\nDoom Eternal Runes: Give Doomguy the edge\nDoom Eternal settings: Kill in high-res glory\nDoom Eternal computer code: Uncover a special treat\nDoom Eternal cheat codes: Escalate the action\nDoom Eternal Battlemode: Tips for victoryAlso on the pile of new stuff to digest: a lot of progression systems. Weapon points, runes, secrets, sentinel batteries, suit upgrades, challenges, weapon mods, skins, weapon mod upgrades, weapon mastery upgrades\u2014it's a lot. Too much, really, because Eternal places the bulk of these upgrades along the critical path. By the end I had almost every upgrade and without trying too hard to find them all, as if it's all an elaborate cardboard front built to make players feel good while ensuring they stay at pace with the steep difficulty curve.Secrets give a little incentive to stop and dig out extra upgrades and collectibles, but they're clearly marked on the map, and Doom Eternal's level design is extremely straightforward. I miss the mazes of old FPS games (or recent homages like Ion Maiden), where finding that last keycard or a hidden door was a big victory. Eternal's goal is momentum with little room for downtime. The ability to climb certain walls, dash in midair, and swing from monkey bars makes for some challenging navigation sequences, but I wanted to spend more time soaking in Eternal's incredible settings rather than just shooting and dashing my way through them.\u00a0The new forms of mobility do shine in the arena, though, especially with how these fights scale up so quickly. It's Doom 2016 endgame stuff from pretty early on, and then surpasses that benchmark, adding tougher demons and even more waves and wild configurations of them, and then surpasses that mark again and again.

Those brief moments of respite allow me to land a nice scoped shot with the chaingun on an arachnotron's scorpion-tail gun turret to make them less of a threat, or freeze a slithering whiplash demon with an ice bomb so it holds still for a gun hug.\u00a0Combat arenas vary from tiny, crowded shotgun gauntlets to huge multilayered jungle gyms. A favorite spans a bubbling river of fire, jump pads on every terrace of the elaborate blistery structures consuming a ruined city. Monkeybars jut out from walls all over that I can swing off of, making it possible to stay in the air for the majority of the fight. I don't have to touch the ground between gibbing a revenant with the railgun and grappling right up to the dumb grin of a cacodemon with the super shotgun's new meat hook attachment. My super shotgun's meat hook sets any demons it lodges into on fire, a cute touch.I cheated the game and didn't cheat myself. Doom Eternal is happy for me. Feels great.The arenas jive with the expanded mobility for a more expressive combat experience than 2016. If I want to do it, I probably can, as if there's an uninterrupted circuit between my brain, the mouse and keyboard, and the Doomguy. It's why getting stuck on Doom's occasionally jagged hell-geometry is such a momentum killer.It happened right at the end of my eighth or so attempt on an early boss. A strenuous arena fight with two Doom Hunters was almost over\u2014I just needed to finish one off\u2014but a smaller demon spawned in front of me and body-blocked me into a corner. Three seconds of standing still and I was dead. I think Doom Eternal knew something was up, because before I respawned a prompt popped up and asked if I wanted to put on some Sentinel Armor.\u00a0It's a difficulty-bracing system that kicks in after a couple deaths and gives you a buff that decreases damage for specific fights. I took the offer and feel better for it because I probably would have stopped playing for a while otherwise. Between the variable difficulties\u2014I pushed through on Ultra-Violence\u2014and salves like Sentinel Armor and extra lives that help remove friction, Doom Eternal did an excellent job pushing me just beyond my limit without burning me out, despite the occasional unfair death.Doom Eternal is a challenging game, but it won't stop you if you'd prefer to take a breezy tour through metal album landscapes and demon guts. Cheats don't affect progression at all. You can clean up any collectibles (except Slayer Gates, an endgame challenge) and finish the whole thing as an unkillable machine. Just drop Eternal to its easiest difficulty and go cheat hunting. They're clearly marked on the map along with every other collectible.\u00a0My favs: Party Mode and QuakeCon Mode. The former makes demons pop like confetti pinatas and the latter frames the action with a 'live' audience that cheers or boos based on how well you're doing. There's even a 'woo' guy. Paired with the classic center-screen gun perspective and a new option that gives Doomguy and his weapons their classic sounds, I'm having a blast whipping through the levels on a second playthrough, cleaning up collectibles as an immortal demigod in a well earned victory lap after my vanilla Ultra-Violence run. I cheated the game and didn't cheat myself. Doom Eternal is happy for me. Feels great.Eternal revisits plenty of old scenery, Hell and Mars included, but also goes to some unexpected locations with distinct architecture and color palettes. Doom 2016 was red and blue. Doom Eternal throws in purple and green and gold and grey. If there was any downtime in Doom Eternal, it was because I stopped between fights to soak in the scale and majesty of its vistas.\u00a0Demons as tall as skyscrapers carrying hell barges around on their backs, swarms of dozens of cacodemons like gnats in the distance, ancient sentinel castles climbing mossy mountains into the clouds\u2014Doom is a full on high fantasy world now, pages and pages of optional lore included.\u00a0Doom Eternal feels like it was made for the PC first.Some of the natural humor is dulled as a result, but I still laugh every time I hear the cartoonish pop of a cacodemon's eye getting ripped from the socket.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "579bf03f-bbf7-4a0f-9df7-413abd1b576a": {"__data__": {"id_": "579bf03f-bbf7-4a0f-9df7-413abd1b576a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "e0847f81-a887-476b-8354-e6bcdab0995f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0cc7b3d8765af8d69e5e8425a658ea451817f77879bb4820c2ed9cdf59798bf8"}, "3": {"node_id": "da185dc7-0954-4cc6-8d6e-08e9b50032cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4a27679f9ba5355f89dff3c1b757e587dcb07801941c3406a86c267be028928"}}, "hash": "52c70c66d705f93e3864b1b3ce9b3a925357d5991cd90925646a353b553f0c42", "text": "Besides, Doom taking itself this seriously feels like a joke of its own. I didn't really care much for the story anyway, even after reading every codex entry. Nothing was lost or gained. It's thematic dressing, an excuse for wack, outrageous settings and action sequences, BFGs, even B'er FGs, and so on.\u00a0Musically, it's an evolution, not a reinvention. Mick Gordon builds on the Doom 2016 sound with chanting heavy metal choruses and a darker, black metal-adjacent vibe overall. This is still a very familiar energetic Meshuggah-inspired sound that I love, it just didn't cover as much new ground as I'd hoped. But without Gordon's signature sound, Doom Eternal would feel empty. The music is integral to the action, an undercurrent of energy to aspire to.In the new Battlemode it's possible to duke it out with other players, either as the slayer or a few demons. It's a multiplayer mode much more aligned with the spirit of Doom, but it wasn't available to try out during the pre-release period. PCG's Emma Matthews had a chance to try it in February and thought it matched the heart-rending pace of the singleplayer mode, it just isn't the main attraction here. We'll be sure to spend more time with it once the servers go live, but whether Battlemode is great or not doesn't change how worthwhile Doom Eternal already is. This is a pretty slick computer game, folks.Doom Eternal feels like it was made for the PC first, too. I had zero hiccups during my 15-hour playthrough. No crashes, no hitching, and I didn't have to bump a single setting down to get my framerate above 120 fps at 1440p. Granted, I have a juicy rig (RTX 2080, i9-9900K), but I'm still used to playing with post-processing junk to inch my fps higher. Our performance review shows Doom Eternal maxed out and maintaining 60 fps at 1080p on a GTX 1650, a $150 GPU. Doom is seriously an industry standout in this regard.Arenas are filled with dozens of demons at once, each one like their own bespoke muppet, each detailed and present in how they're put together and how they fall apart. The gore system breaks them up piece by piece, exposing gristle and bruised muscle and bones underneath. And Doom never skips a beat rendering all the demon bits and weapon effects and wild environments, my mouse whipping around so fast as if to dare it to all gum up. Nah.\u00a0Anything less than perfect performance wouldn't do, because Doom Eternal is one of the most demanding arena shooters I've ever played, a game that teases out and hones every muscle memory committed to my right forearm and left hand fingertips since they graced a mouse and keyboard. It's bright and loud, hyper violent yet tastefully refined, and absolutely draining. I can't recall playing a shooter where sensory overload was one of the most common reasons for death.\u00a0Doom Eternal is a ceaseless, panicked nightmare that pushes you to point and click with more skill and style than ever before. James is stuck in an endless loop, playing the Dark Souls games on repeat until Elden Ring and Silksong set him free.

Still, if we're going to liken games to pornography, and assuming it's the more kinetic kind of pornography you're after, I heartily recommend Doom Eternal: a looping video compilation of oversized guns and fists plunging into squelchy orifices, spurting along at 60 frames a second.2016's accomplished reboot was already quite the debauch, its firefights punctuated by leering close-ups of skewered hellspawn, its heavy metal soundtrack always building to a crescendo. Eternal turns up the heat even further, allowing you to dash and flip your way around arenas that are newly fixated on the vertical axis. Dripping organs are wrenched out of, then stuffed back into, demon torsos; chargeable alt-fires scream for release; health orbs spatter the ramps and chokepoints like - well, you get the picture. The environments often look like the work of an adolescent H.R. Giger who's just got into AC/DC. Aside from silvery Protoss-ish fortresses and some seriously down-at-heel office blocks, you'll wander labyrinths of squirming flesh, using runes to unclench toothy sphincters and shearing pop-up tentacles in half with your shotgun. Some, of course, will soberly insist that all of this is just good, honest, videogame violence - clean, upstanding fun with absolutely no over- or undertones whatsoever. And to these people I say: when I am walking down the shaft of an enormous spear, straight into the pierced belly of a reeling, gaping titan, it is difficult to argue that there isn't some kind of metaphor in play. \"Rip and tear\"? More like rip and splooge.Carmack's porn quote (which he has since qualified a little) epitomises the view that narrative in games is always an imposition, a foreign body carried over from film and literature. It's a view that has been roundly debunked. The thing is, though, Eternal does have a story, somewhere in amongst the parade of demon O-faces, and while that story is lightweight by Zenimax game standards, it feels hopelessly grafted on. Having thwarted Hell's invasion of Mars, the legendary Doom Slayer must purge Earth itself of diabolical interlopers, setting out from a gothic orbital station turned customisation hub to a series of ravaged cities, factories and temples that feel on loan from Gears of War. In the process, he must also tunnel back into a startlingly eventful past, sitting through flashbacks and wrangling with old allies.The 2016 game was a thrilling reimagining of the speed and ferocity of 90s Doom combat, but it also magnified Doom's narrative trappings, adding in cutscenes, audio diaries, codex entries and mid-mission dialogue - a curious reversal of one of id's key decisions with the original game, which was once planned to include a sizeable narrative component written by co-founder Tom Hall. Eternal adds yet more to the load, expanding the cast and redoubling the emphasis on lore.The cutscenes are now a mix of first and third-person, which means the Slayer is a fully tangible human being - one you can, moreover, trick out with unlockable outfits and weapon skins - rather than a pair of enormous fists twitching beneath your aiming reticle. He feels enclosed by the fiction, rather than, as Christian Donlan put it back in the day, like a man who is also playing Doom and who shares your resentment for anything that gets in the way. There's some effort to explain the character's superhuman prowess, with one scientist suggesting that you represent humanity's rage to survive, as opposed to humanity's love of making Cacodemons pop in slow motion. The Slayer even has a voice these days, though I think he strings together maybe five words in total. True, our man in green never looks happy with all the attention, stomping impatiently through cinematics while other parties monologue at his retreating head (if they're lucky, that is - the fate of most speaking roles in Eternal is to be ground up like tuna). Nor are you required to listen to the audio diaries, or dip into the codex. But these elements drag on you nonetheless, like the lakes of purple goop that stop you running or jumping in certain levels. They're a deflating reminder that you are no longer here just to indulge your baser instincts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55cafda1-9e2d-4a1d-b9dc-3301f7dfff00": {"__data__": {"id_": "55cafda1-9e2d-4a1d-b9dc-3301f7dfff00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "da185dc7-0954-4cc6-8d6e-08e9b50032cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4a27679f9ba5355f89dff3c1b757e587dcb07801941c3406a86c267be028928"}, "3": {"node_id": "c71b2907-7b39-40e4-b970-d50032d7dce0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1939f6c91eaa1cab6a9ec06d0798a4c141f921902b28fb678facf5af8439b5a"}}, "hash": "c0910f5736684a2a3be63c387bd3ffd45645b0e80a7110f5c530ae9d1a483135", "text": "Conversely, the developer's guilty awareness that people don't play Doom for the narrative means that when you do dig into the world-building, you'll find it to be scanty and by-the-numbers: a set of tired references to ancient races, legendary battles and fallen cities.Still, if visceral gratification is the goal, Eternal amply delivers. The combat is once again about ceaseless pivoting between attack and retreat, care of a raucous battlefield ecology which sees you ripping ammo, health and armour refills from your prey rather than just searching for medikits or finding somewhere to cool off. Stun a foe and you can execute them for a smidgeon of health. These executions double as windows of rest, with other demons easing off till you're done rearranging your victim's anatomy. They can also be triggered from metres away, warping you to the target without even the courtesy of a transitional animation, which means you can use them to escape or get behind a mob. Bisect demons with your trusty chainsaw, meanwhile, and you'll be rewarded with a geyser of ammo, restocking all your weapons in one dollop. You'll need plenty of chainsaw fuel to carve up the bigger demons, but you'll always have enough to carve up the smaller \"fodder\" demons, who spawn endlessly throughout each battle till the larger demons are slain. This hyper-aggressive resourcing style forces you to close the gap with foes who are, in any case, very good at running you down. Some, like the minion-summoning Archville, are closer to terrain hazards, but the underworld's legions are light on snipers or artillery; pretty much everybody, from the podgy Mancubus to the serpentine Whiplash, is hell-bent on getting in your face. It sounds like chaos, and often is, but there's a lot of science to Eternal's combat, and solid artistry to how the key variables are conveyed from second to second. Ammo, health and armour drops are colour-coded; staggered enemies flash blue, then orange when you're within striking distance. The game's audio is similarly readable, once you acclimatise to the roaring heavy metal soundtrack. You'll learn to follow the progress of the battle by ear - be it the tink of a cooldown gauge, the belch of a Cacodemon that has just swallowed something explosive, teeing it up for an execution, or the nasal howl of a charging Pinky.New variables include an ice grenade, mapped to the trigger, which lets you flash-freeze whole groups to interrupt otherwise lethal offensives. You can also light foes up with your shoulder flamethrower attachment, causing them to spit out armour parts and further motivating you to fight at close quarters when you're hurting. The most important change-up, however, is your newfound agility. Besides availing himself of launchpads, the Slayer can now perform aerial dashes, scuttle up laddered surfaces, swing from monkey bars and use a Super Shotgun-mounted grapple line to yank himself towards or past enemies. This encourages showboating reminiscent of anti-gravity duels in the sadly-forgotten Lawbreakers. You might grapple somebody, fling yourself past them while firing your shotgun pointblank, then double-jump to a monkey bar, hurling yourself at a stunned Pain Elemental, then drop neatly onto a launchpad while switching to your Heavy Assault Rifle so that you can carpet the arena in micro-missiles. The weapons are by and large entertaining rejigs of Doom 2016's offerings, with two upgradeable alternate-fires per gun that lend themselves to different tactics and different opponents. Your shotgun, for instance, can serve as either a sticky grenade launcher - useful when trying to shoot the turret off a Cyberdemon - or a buckshot-firing Gatling gun for crowd control. Inevitably, the charm of Eternal diminishes the further you travel from these firefights. Its grander story component aside, the game is slightly over-burdened with customisation systems. Besides tracking down weapon mods in levels themselves, you'll equip runes for perks such as slow-mo when you aim in mid-air, together with Praetor Suit upgrades such as the ability to suck in health drops from further away. There's a knack to combining Rune perks, especially when tackling \"Master\" versions of levels that have more punishing enemy spawn patterns, but the role-playing systems aren't novel, and the associated menu-diving bogs down a shooter that's at its best in the thick of the bloodshed.What really saps Eternal, however, is the predictable way the campaign once again breaks down into combat bowls and platforming stretches that feel like they've been stripped at random from Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c71b2907-7b39-40e4-b970-d50032d7dce0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c71b2907-7b39-40e4-b970-d50032d7dce0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "55cafda1-9e2d-4a1d-b9dc-3301f7dfff00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0910f5736684a2a3be63c387bd3ffd45645b0e80a7110f5c530ae9d1a483135"}, "3": {"node_id": "13d2aa48-83fb-4be1-958e-9c95d9b251a2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c80d62a4de4890ccdd4031b28730955722abf6010a9c9953642792af168deb9d"}}, "hash": "e1939f6c91eaa1cab6a9ec06d0798a4c141f921902b28fb678facf5af8439b5a", "text": "There are collectibles to unearth, some tucked in high alcoves or behind smashable walls, together with optional hidden battle chambers, but the alternation of shoot-out then jumpy bit then shoot-out is the same throughout. Boss battles are the biggest change of tune - the final clash is a doozie, a gruelling two-phase affair in which your nemesis looms over the layout like the world's angriest D&D player. But some of them are just annoying, a question of repeating a tactic to whittle down a health-bar. It's revealing that the game offers you a layer of all-but-indestructible Sentinel armour after a certain number of deaths, though Eternal's accessibility is otherwise refreshing: dropping the difficulty doesn't cost you anything in terms of progress, and you revert to the previous difficulty once the bossfight is over.It's worth remembering that old school Doom wasn't just a series of one-man massacres. It could be ominous and anxiety-inducing. It had monsters you could hear through walls, shambling about in the guts of the level, and concealed partitions that slid open without warning. It had a narrative, just about, but it didn't try to root the weirdness of its concept or spaces in lore, and its secrets were as much about enjoying the possibilities of virtual architecture as securing a power-up. It was a world of alarming corners and optical tricks that deformed and shifted simply because it could. For all its abundance of things to find, you don't get quite the same feeling in Doom Eternal. At times, it feels like the levels have been designed backwards from the completion screen, with its grocery lists of optional treasures and encounters. You might argue that 3D worlds are simply less surprising on the whole in 2020 than in 1993, but that's to ignore the work of countless Doom modders whose creations, made using id's original engine and tools, continue to startle and intrigue today.The missing link in this review is multiplayer, which is offline for the moment, but which already looks like a step up from Doom 2016's ramshackle online. It's a strictly asymmetrical affair, with one player starring as the Slayer while the others control one of five demon breeds from the campaign. As a demon, you can summon AI-controlled hellspawn with the D-pad, so victory is presumably as much about mob strategy as dealing damage yourself. Which sounds like a pleasant way to cool off once you've tired of the sweaty embrace of a campaign that, for all its breaking of Carmack's ancient maxim, has a shot at being one of the best you'll play this year. Still, Doom Eternal leaves me undecided. The game is fundamentally the 2016 reboot again with new props, and its dogged commitment to Doom's narrative universe is as baffling as the firefights are exhilarating. Is this really all Doom can be, nowadays - a cascade of collectables, unwanted cutscenes and the spectacle of a gurning demon face, forever? \n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nEdwin Evans-Thirlwell\n\n          Contributor\n        Edwin is a writer from London hailed by peers as \"terminally middle-class\" and \"experienced\".

It is an elaborate and self-indulgent production, its violence so over the top that you can't help but smile as it spills out over the stage and under your feet. It's an utterly ridiculous and strangely endearing showing, warping your suspension of disbelief so extensively that you'll wonder whether you've crossed over to another dimension \u2013 to a world where the first-person shooter followed the archaic directions first outlined by Doom in 1993 without question instead of turning toward the teachings of Half-Life.\u00a0The problem with this stage show is that the screaming has to stop sometime. The director is hoarse and is begging you to enjoy an intermission from the action. The bullet casings need to be collected, they tell you; the buckets of blood need to be refilled, the gore mopped up, and the guitars tuned back down to D. The cast of cannon fodder needs to take a breather as the next hellish stage is reset somewhere out of sight. You were moving too fast, and there's still a little story left to shout into your face.\u00a0Doom Eternal is at its worst when it makes you slow down; it struggles to settle in silence.\u00a0I can count the number of first-person shooters that can function competently as platformers on one hand, and Doom Eternal is not among them. Developer id Software has found itself caught, by attempting to straddle the line between inducing nostalgia and embracing evolution it has disrupted the conditions in which Doom (2016) was able to so effortlessly thrive.\u00a0Doom Eternal routinely breaks the pace of its action by forcing you to stiffly navigate towering spaces at regular intervals. You'll do this by swinging imprecisely between monkey bars, scaling bland craggy walls, bouncing off of unstable platforms, dashing between spacious maws of death, and double-jumping to ledges with slippery collision detection. Doom's movement systems are tightly refined, designed to keep your crosshairs focused on fast-moving enemies amongst a backdrop of colourful chaos. These systems struggle when you're pushed to slowly and methodically scale the environment with little room for error to reach the next combat arena.\u00a0It's levels like Doom Hunter Base, Super Gore Nest, and Mars Core that make up the bulk of the mid-game that are hit hardest by this design decision. These spaces are larger and more ambitious than anything the studio has committed to before with Doom, and they struggle to maintain momentum.\u00a0\"As a prerequisite to progression, platforming only serves to introduce points of friction in an otherwise frictionless experience.\"First-person platforming just about works for Doom when it is an optional extravagance \u2013 when you're off exploring for the myriad of optional collectable scattered throughout each of the missions \u2013 but as a prerequisite to progression they only serve to introduce points of friction in an otherwise frictionless experience.\u00a0By the time underwater sections were introduced \u2013 slowing you down even further, with the added annoyance of mitigating radioactive damage thrown in for good measure \u2013 it starts to become difficult to resist the urge to put the controller down and walk away entirely. That all said, it's difficult to indulge in these tendencies when you're faced with the prospect of coming across another sensationally-realised vista or the opportunity to shove the Super Shotgun double-barrel deep into the throat of a Baron of Hell. \u00a0That's where Doom Eternal feels right, revelling in ultra-violence across some impossibly beautiful environments. The game has built on the core loop that helped propel its predecessor from mere revival-project to genuine revolution, its central gimmick always working to keep players moving and \u2013 critically \u2013 engaging with enemies.\u00a0Glory Kills are still the star of the combat experience. Pumping enemies with enough bullets to reach a damage threshold will make them glow, indicating that you can do some graphic combination of: decapitation / goring / smashing / bashing / slicing / knifing / ripping / tearing (delete as necessary). These melee executions aren't just for show, they serve as your primary method of retrieving health.\u00a0It encourages you to play Doom Eternal the way id wants you to play it. The studio wants you to be moving and shooting as quickly as you can, giving as much aggression back to the hulking monsters as they give to you.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d92be3d-1f74-44a0-92e6-f4d066bbd0e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d92be3d-1f74-44a0-92e6-f4d066bbd0e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "00ee945f-00c0-4eeb-b2dc-1804a683b39d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7278524918d9f9940bd32a32c5db79ffb4ab465ec1a0f0c199411490b7b338b7"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e4fd406-c6d7-4abd-b571-b3e6acb9a9ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffbdef370a0bf441166a0473dcb0f879f001c946063a319afec6a767bad4f1b1"}}, "hash": "e793bbb676256d1b1accd84275e64081245610a417bed54d6736efd94b591757", "text": "To succeed in Doom Eternal \u2013 especially once you begin to whip through the difficulty levels \u2013 you must get in the face of enemies and never back away from a tough encounter; there's no faster way to meet your maker than to engage in a half-hearted retreat, with victory earned by engaging with the relentless pace of the action on its own terms \u2013 backing off is never an option, carrying through with forward momentum towards piles of ammunition, red barrels, and, yes, fresh enemies to rip and tear through is the key to victory.\u00a0If you aren't in need of health, you'll find that your Chainsaw can be used to chew through foes and retrieve ammunition, which is always in short supply. Your flame belch, a shoulder-mounted flamethrower, can burn enemies and deliver armour plating when shot, while Glory Kills also charge up your ability to deliver a devastating Blood Punch which eviscerates just about anything within your immediate cone of vision. \u00a0All in all, it's a killer cycle that only helps propel Doom Eternal's core combat to new heights. \u00a0Speaking of the core combat, it's been a long-standing rule that you judge an id shooter on the strength of its shotguns. Unsurprisingly, the studio has taken its penchant for building the best boomsticks in video games and outdone itself. The Super Shotgun is impossible to put away; it screams power with every shot, its weight and staggering punch as satisfying to use the opening hours of the game to the last.Weapons have always been at the heart of Doom, and Eternal is no slouch in this regard. You'll also find that each of the firearms can once again be upgraded throughout the game with Weapon Points, earned by completing in-mission objectives and chaos thresholds. Most weapons have two available modifications, each of which can be switched up with a simple button press, and offer an array of utterly ridiculous additional ways to turn demons to pulp. Exploring the environments will also help you earn Sentinel Crystals and Praetor Suit points which can be used to upgrade your armour, improving its utility and resistance, or upgrading your health, armour, and ammo capacities. \u00a0You'll want to invest in these upgrades and improvements early on, because Doom Eternal isn't afraid to beat your head against the wall until it's a pulpy mess. By the late game, Doom Eternal gets brutal, really pushing you to utilise all of your available abilities and weapons to get through its combat arenas in one piece.\u00a0For the most part, Doom Eternal casts its action in locked-off combat arenas, pushing you to skirt through them at speed looking for the most violent lines of none-stop navigation. These spaces aren't as tightly designed as the ones featured in Doom (2016), which I believe is down to the increased verticality \u2013 id is desperate to get you utilising its first-person platforming systems, even in the middle of frantic fights \u2013 but they are still great to engage enemies in.\u00a0That said, Doom Eternal does suffer because of some of its enemy design. The game is structured around escalating encounters \u2013 it introduces you to an enemy type on its own, lets you figure out the hook to slaying it, and then continues to throw a litany of them at you once. It's a potent design that keeps Doom Eternal feeling frantic at all times, with the game's aggressive and persistent AI ensuring that some of these creatures combine tactics to overwhelm you in some truly terrifying ways. \u00a0Combat arenas are usually a mixture of Heavy Cannon fodder \u2013 foes that can be quickly chewed up or smashed down for an easy burst of ammo or health \u2013 and larger, more punishing enemies that'll take a few runs around the arena to drop. This structure maintains momentum, and the relentless pace that the core ethos that the game is built on. Until it makes you slow down.\u00a0Boss battles with health bars were a blight on Doom (2016), and while that isn't so much of a problem here, there are a handful of enemy types that bring play screeching to a halt. For Doom Eternal to work, it has to have you managing your time between multiple enemy types and constantly leaving you on the verge of being totally overwhelmed, constantly asking you to push your understanding of the movement and combat mechanics to the max. And in comes a Marauder (a brand new demon designed for Eternal) or a returning Archvile, Super Heavy enemies that are generally no fun to fight. The Marauder, in particular, only works to slow combat to a crawl. It's an enemy type designed inherently for one-versus-one encounters, and it doesn't work in the controlled chaos of the wider combat experience.\u00a0Still, that's a small annoyance in an otherwise blistering FPS. If you can bite your lip and endure some routinely frustrating levels built around platforming, then you're going to have one hell of a good time with Doom Eternal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e4fd406-c6d7-4abd-b571-b3e6acb9a9ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e4fd406-c6d7-4abd-b571-b3e6acb9a9ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d92be3d-1f74-44a0-92e6-f4d066bbd0e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e793bbb676256d1b1accd84275e64081245610a417bed54d6736efd94b591757"}, "3": {"node_id": "dba0628f-9c23-41ee-abbc-af3bc1803419", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6b1078e980dd94d193bc702b8ecc76904a7471e1b5fe4feb0f259e75fe43a2a"}}, "hash": "ffbdef370a0bf441166a0473dcb0f879f001c946063a319afec6a767bad4f1b1", "text": "It's a fast, smart, and frantic shooter that seems to find real delight in testing your endurance.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, The follow-up to id Software\u2019s reboot of Doom is finally here but will it be the proper sequel that the series has always been denied?Back when the Doom reboot came out a few years ago, we felt a little ostracised for not seeming to like it quite as much as other people. It was a good game, with some fantastic combat, but for us it fizzled out long before the end. So we were relieved to find that when we spoke to co-director Marty Stratton he agreed and insisted that sequel Doom Eternal would specifically address that and other complaints. And while we do still have a few qualms he wasn\u2019t lying.Although it was not the first ever first person shooter, the original 1993 Doom was the milestone release that popularised the genre and established many of its standards. It\u2019s still perfectly playable today (there\u2019s some very good ports available on all current formats) but updating it for modern times presents an obvious problem given how old the game is; an issue that the 2016 reboot addressed by focusing on arcade style action supported by Metroid Prime style exploration.Oddly, Doom Eternal is really the first proper sequel the series has ever had, since Doom 2 was little more than an expansion pack and Doom 3 was really just another reboot. Doom Eternal follows on directly from the end of the 2016 game and\u2026 we\u2019ve got very little idea of what is supposed to be going on. That\u2019s not really important, because this is Doom we\u2019re talking about, but Doom Eternal has a level of opaque storytelling and impenetrable lore that makes the average Final Fantasy look straightforward.Despite the stripped-down nature of the reboot\u2019s story the sequel manages to be very confusing from the first instant, especially if you don\u2019t read the codex descriptions littering most levels. But basically, Hell has invaded Earth and the Doom Slayer (i.e. you) has a\u2026 magic spaceship castle that you got from aliens/interdimensional not-angels that have a vested interest in seeing the Earth overrun because they mine Hell for \u2018argent energy\u2019. Or at least we think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. Either way, the end result is that the demons might as well be space aliens for all the difference it makes.Far more interesting than the plot is the action, which really is fantastic. On one hand it\u2019s extremely old school, since there\u2019s no aiming down sights, no reloading, no recharging health, and no dying from a fall. But the silky smooth gunplay still feels very weighty and engaging, as crowd control and situational awareness become your priority over precision shooting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dba0628f-9c23-41ee-abbc-af3bc1803419": {"__data__": {"id_": "dba0628f-9c23-41ee-abbc-af3bc1803419", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e4fd406-c6d7-4abd-b571-b3e6acb9a9ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffbdef370a0bf441166a0473dcb0f879f001c946063a319afec6a767bad4f1b1"}, "3": {"node_id": "1226232e-3052-46ef-93a7-d78f81d26d8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed8cd1d35093b8b082c21368f1612395f3171c710877557734cdeeac6b21b65f"}}, "hash": "f6b1078e980dd94d193bc702b8ecc76904a7471e1b5fe4feb0f259e75fe43a2a", "text": "All that is essentially the same as the 2016 game, but onto that Doom Eternal adds several layers of intriguing complication.Expanding on the glory kills of the last game, where you got extra health for performing a finishing move, you now get additional item drops depending on which special weapon you use. Glory kills provide health but also fill up a blood punch meter if you perform enough of them, while chainsaw attacks drop ammo and your flamethrower causes demons to drop armour. This is the core of your tactical considerations, which result in you viewing the monsters of Hell as mobile supply drops.Many criticised the reboot for being mindless, but it was anything but. Complex forward planning might be impossible, but the action forces you to constantly refine your short term goals, based on what resources you need and what demons you\u2019re faced with. And in the sequel there\u2019s not just the aforementioned item drops but also demons with different weak spots that are best exploited by specific weapons \u2013 many of which have their own ammo as well as two different, unlockable weapon mods that offer alternative fire modes and which can themselves be upgraded.Your suit can be upgraded too, with separate collectibles, and there are special runes you can find to give you additional abilities or crystals that increase your health, armour, or ammo capacity. Classic Doom power-ups are often available and there are two different kinds of frag grenade (also upgradable), and even hidden cheat codes. It sounds like it should be a confusing mess of overcomplicated options, but it absolutely isn\u2019t. Everything is introduced at a sensible pace and very quickly clicks, as you learn to use your entire range of options in battle.Most of Doom Eternal\u2019s enemy encounters take place in small, closed off sections of a level, which are then filled to the brim with demons for you to deal with. Whatever problems we have with the rest of the game, these moments are always fantastically exciting, as you react both on instinct and a constantly changing tactical plan. Doom Eternal forces quick thinking as much as it does quick aiming and when it all comes together, with the blaring soundtrack that\u2019s half electronica and half heavy metal, it is glorious.The multiplayer options weren\u2019t online prior to launch but the competitive modes seem to be similar to the more Quake-inspired play of the last game, which was novel for a short time but never had much longevity. The Dark Souls style elements in the story campaign do sound interesting though, where a demon can become extra powerful if it\u2019s beaten a number of other players already or where other people can invade your game controlling a demon of their own.Combat is not all there is to Doom Enteral and in order to break up the battles you still have the Metroid Prime style exploration of the last game. The level design is often still confusing but there are always plenty of interesting secrets to discover, so it can be very satisfying. But what seems unwise is the way the sequel expands on the platforming, to create some of the most difficult and frustrating first person sequences we\u2019ve seen in a long time.We kept being reminded of the Super Mario Sunshine void levels, where your backpack is taken away from you, which would have been a compliment if this was a 3D platformer. But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s Doom. And in any case, working out where you have to go is often the most difficult part, with the game relying on weird angles and unlikely starting points that constantly have you questioning whether what you\u2019re attempting is even possible.There\u2019s one set piece, involving infinitely-spawning demons, powered up by a nearby \u2018buff totem\u2019, that had us stuck for a good 30 minutes or more \u2013 not because it was too hard but because we had no idea where to go. Even now, we\u2019re still not sure we did it right as the fallen traffic light we were jumping off seemed more like a glitch than a platform. But if there was an alternative solution we never found it.Thankfully, having to jump and fight at the same time is relatively rare but when it happens it\u2019s infuriating, as Doom Eternal is not an easy game even on the lowest difficulty level. There are a couple of nasty difficulty spikes too, that then flatten back down for no obvious reason straight after.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1226232e-3052-46ef-93a7-d78f81d26d8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1226232e-3052-46ef-93a7-d78f81d26d8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "dba0628f-9c23-41ee-abbc-af3bc1803419", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6b1078e980dd94d193bc702b8ecc76904a7471e1b5fe4feb0f259e75fe43a2a"}, "3": {"node_id": "613f9754-691c-4fc7-afc7-f1e5abf5801e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e3c40126aea4b55077bf6982637f2801e5d344590a5ffcbabd5b27b46962933"}}, "hash": "ed8cd1d35093b8b082c21368f1612395f3171c710877557734cdeeac6b21b65f", "text": "Levels always seem to go on for that bit too long, and end suddenly, and while there\u2019s much more variety in backdrops than the last game it\u2019s only the Earth levels that have any real visual panache.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader\u2019s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepThe original Doom may have been one of the most important graphical milestones in gaming, but Doom Eternal is competent and nothing more. A lot of that is due to the 60fps frame rate, which is certainly a sensible priority, but between the unexciting art design and some underwhelming sound effects the presentation is not all that it could be.We don\u2019t want to dwell on the negatives though, as when the game is good it\u2019s very, very good. But just as the reboot showed obvious room for improvement this still needs to be ratcheted up a little more to reach its full potential. Hopefully id Software are planning a trilogy and if it shows the same improvement as from the first to the second game, then the third could end up being one of the best first shooters ever. Just as its legacy demands.In Short: A significant improvement on the reboot and while there are still a few flaws the core combat is some of the best in any first person shooter this generation.Pros: Excellent combat, with multiple layers of weaponry that should be confusing and overcomplicated but work together perfectly. Tons of content and collectibles.Cons: Some general pacing and difficulty issues, with the platforming in particular being very poorly judged.

Tear. Celebrate. Doom Eternal is an FPS feast that bombards players with adrenaline-soaked excitement and ridiculous amounts of gore. In this direct continuation to 2016\u2019s reimagining of Doom, developer id Software plays the role of angel and devil, empowering the legendary Doom Slayer with more might, while simultaneously giving the demons more hellish ways to inflict pain. This clashing of titans is a spectacle to behold. Explosions and guts soar across the battlefield as heavy metal pounds to the carnage. No matter who is left standing, the player is the beneficiary of the series\u2019 best combat, which hits an exhilarating fever pitch.The Doom Slayer has always been powerful, but now he\u2019s armed to the teeth with a truckload of gear. He\u2019s carrying eight firearms and can call upon an awesome new shoulder-mounted launcher with a vast array of ammo types. Ranged combat isn\u2019t his only means of destruction, though. The Slayer also has a blade that extends from his arm to yank hearts out of chests, and when things get dire, he can once again whip out the Crucible, which is basically a one-hit lightsaber. The selection of weapons gives players the tools to approach combat from a number of new vectors and change course on the fly, resulting in a deep and strategic experience that kicks like a mule.Given how many enemies stand in the Slayer\u2019s way \u2013 not to mention the immense amounts of ammo needed to drop them \u2013 his weapons can be depleted in a flash, leaving him with nothing but a noisy chainsaw (which is also a blast to use, especially since it rewards him with ammo for every gun). The combat, as gory as it may be, is beautifully orchestrated, and once again embraces the \u201cpush forward\u201d design, meaning you need to keep moving from enemy to enemy in order to survive. Slowing down or ducking behind cover will almost certainly bring death. Even as you dart across the battlefield, demons teleport to your location and you need to drop them quickly to advance to the next dance of death.With its new additions, Doom Eternal is a far more challenging game than its predecessor. That being said, it feels fair and manageable given the firepower you now pack and the numerous ways you can regain slivers of health. Part of the difficulty increase comes from the introduction of new enemy types.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "613f9754-691c-4fc7-afc7-f1e5abf5801e": {"__data__": {"id_": "613f9754-691c-4fc7-afc7-f1e5abf5801e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "1226232e-3052-46ef-93a7-d78f81d26d8c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed8cd1d35093b8b082c21368f1612395f3171c710877557734cdeeac6b21b65f"}, "3": {"node_id": "6657727e-4f03-430b-af11-675f14a987cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6f7635445d416efc4db60873914151a837cff836fb00502acf857a1990938d1"}}, "hash": "6e3c40126aea4b55077bf6982637f2801e5d344590a5ffcbabd5b27b46962933", "text": "Part of the difficulty increase comes from the introduction of new enemy types. While the threat delivered by the pain elemental doesn\u2019t quite live up to its name, the archvile is a serious nuisance that must be dealt with immediately. He spawns enemies everywhere, protects himself with a fire shield, and has a thick hide that can soak up ammo. Most encounters, whether against foes old or new, put up a decent challenge and can be deadly if you are sloppy in your execution.Many adversaries can take a beating, and you can now see it with your own eyes through awesome new cosmetic damage. Each shot picks away at their armor and flesh, and if they look like walking skeletons, they\u2019re surely ready to meet the reaper. This is a fantastic way of showing mid-battle progress, and it looks great.When a foe is about to fall, you see it flash orange or blue, meaning you can execute them with a glory kill. These finishers are as gruesome as they are comical \u2013 one demon may be ripped in two, whereas another may have its head smashed into its chest like a whack-a-mole. Glory kills once again serve the role of a much-needed three-second breather that allows players to think about their next move (and also gain a little health back).Much like the 2016 game, the action runs smoothly and is all about pinpoint precision and exploiting enemy weaknesses. The controls are beautifully fashioned, allowing players to quickly switch weapons, toggle between their various firing modes, and dart across the battlefield like a high-flying trapeze.The gunplay may be the bloody centerpiece, but it is accented by greatly enhanced environmental traversal. The player can double jump, dash, latch onto walls, swing from poles, and even use a meat hook (which is fired from the super shotgun) to latch onto an enemy and zoom to its location. Some of these actions are sewn into combat, but when the last demon hits the ground, you will likely be tasked to use them to traverse hazardous terrain \u2013 complete with the spinning fireball chains from the Mario games. These sections are excellently designed, and require precise timing and trajectories. The platforming element also comes into play to solve environmental puzzles \u2013 perhaps to open a door or reach a new area.Some of these puzzles are flat-out silly and feel out of place in a game like Doom Eternal. The greatest killer in the cosmos apparently has to shoot buttons and push blocks to figure out how to open doors. To ensure players aren\u2019t stumped for long, id even color-coded puzzle elements in glowing green, meaning you don\u2019t really have to put too much brainpower into them. They are more of a nuisance than anything.Doom Eternal is overflowing with secrets to unearth; some are fun collectibles, and others simply flesh out the lore. The most important secrets are upgrades, and there are plenty to track down. Mods once again give your weapons special abilities that you switch to on the fly. For instance, the combat shotgun can fire sticky bombs or turn into a fully automatic weapon. These mods are clever and give each tool of destruction a decidedly different feel. You can also track down tokens to upgrade these mods, again giving you plenty of reason to explore the linear levels fully.The Slayer\u2019s suit can be enhanced for both combat and cosmetic purposes, deepening the gameplay further. It even allows you to tweak the flow of play itself through runes. These powerful stones assist the player in everything from enhanced airborne movement control to slowing time at the brink of death, and much more. All of these upgrade systems make a huge difference.On the multiplayer front, Doom Eternal is a huge step back for the entire series. You can\u2019t deathmatch, make your own maps, and the only option available at launch is an asymmetrical 2v1 experience called Battlemode. It\u2019s basically a game of cat and mouse between a human-controlled Slayer and two human-controlled demons. The Slayer, who has all of his gear from the campaign, is the cat. The battles are frantic, and playing as demons like the Revenant and Mancubus is amusing, but there isn\u2019t much meat on this multiplayer experience\u2019s bones, and it pales in comparison to the series\u2019 other offerings.From a combat standpoint, you couldn\u2019t ask for much more from Doom Eternal. It roars with excitement, and just keeps getting bigger and better as it goes. Yes, it stumbles a little in puzzles, but players are frequently rewarded handsomely for making the efforts to crack them. Id Software made Doom relevant again with the 2016 game, and now the developer is clearly having fun showing players how wild this vision can get.\nView the discussion thread.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6657727e-4f03-430b-af11-675f14a987cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "6657727e-4f03-430b-af11-675f14a987cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "613f9754-691c-4fc7-afc7-f1e5abf5801e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e3c40126aea4b55077bf6982637f2801e5d344590a5ffcbabd5b27b46962933"}, "3": {"node_id": "172361c3-7796-40ad-9ef6-371a3848715d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f195efae72f8d434ed71c87c996f149e7df2775ea2cca55889d015050342de0"}}, "hash": "d6f7635445d416efc4db60873914151a837cff836fb00502acf857a1990938d1", "text": "View the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer. All Rights Reserved.\nGameSpot, Doom Eternal intensifies the battles with Hell's hordes by requiring you to constantly calculate the best ways to rip, tear, and stay alive.By \n    Phil Hornshaw\n   on March 27, 2020 at 7:38AM PDTId Software's return to Doom in 2016 was a phenomenal update of the franchise's classic shooter formula. It was fast and intense, full of huge monsters and scorching metal tracks, modernizing the feel of the 1990s original while adding some new-school flourishes. Where Doom 2016 brought the original Doom into the present, Doom Eternal feels like a big step forward in making the franchise something new: It's a master class in demon dismemberment after the introductory course to ripping and tearing of four years ago. Like its predecessor, Doom Eternal makes you feel like a monster-shredding badass--not just because you're the strongest Doom Slayer, but because you're also the smartest.Doom Eternal is all about effectively using the huge amount of murder tools at your disposal. Health, armor, and ammo pickups are at a minimum in Eternal's many combat arenas, and the game instead requires you to earn these by massacring monsters in a variety of different ways. Stagger an enemy and you can tear them apart with a brutal glory kill, which refills your health; douse a demon with the new flamethrower and they'll start to spout armor pickups; or cut them in half with the chainsaw to grab some much-needed ammo.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Doom Eternal Video ReviewIn order to stay alive, you can't just run around blasting madly, expecting to tear through everything in your path; you have to run around blasting rationally to keep yourself at fighting strength. Keeping all your numbers up means continually rotating through your glory, chainsaw, and flamethrower kills while also making sure you're using the right gun for a particular job. Many of the toughest enemies now have weak points that allow you to snipe off their most lethal weapons, and you'll need to assess threats and knock them out quickly.At first, it seems like Doom Eternal provides an altogether unwieldy list of things to manage. Between all its weapons and tools, their various ammo counters, and your health, it can all become overwhelming. With so much to keep in mind at all times, it takes a bit to get accustomed to Doom Eternal. And constantly pausing the action to pull up your weapon wheel to check ammo counters and decide which weapon to use on the monster about to tear your face off can feel antithetical to Doom's run-and-gun, rip-apart-everything approach.Once you get the hang of it, though, all of Doom Eternal's many elements come together in a cascade of mayhem that makes you into the brainiest killing machine around. This isn't the kind of shooter in which your twitch reactions and aiming skills will carry you through; Eternal is a game in which you have to be constantly plotting your next move, executing a calculus of carnage to keep yourself alive and make everything else dead. Every moment is about analyzing the battlefield to find the next enemy you can stagger and slice apart for health or ammo, figuring out which enemy is your top priority and what guns you'll need to take it out safely, and where you need to head next in order to take the shots you need or keep the creatures chasing you from getting their own chance to rip and tear.The mental math of figuring out how to keep yourself alive is a big part of what makes the game fun, but it's the improved mobility that really lets Doom Eternal kick off a metal guitar solo and start shredding. Every big battle takes place in a multi-level arena adorned with jump pads and monkey bars that let you get around quickly, and you also have a double-jump and horizontal dash move for avoiding attacks and crossing distances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "172361c3-7796-40ad-9ef6-371a3848715d": {"__data__": {"id_": "172361c3-7796-40ad-9ef6-371a3848715d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "6657727e-4f03-430b-af11-675f14a987cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6f7635445d416efc4db60873914151a837cff836fb00502acf857a1990938d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "15357b78-783f-4820-b9c1-27a6eab99dc7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d9043197146fdecacd2c5facfebd2e761a88ca17c458e711dc46d4fa972e1a05"}}, "hash": "1f195efae72f8d434ed71c87c996f149e7df2775ea2cca55889d015050342de0", "text": "A few arenas have their irritations, especially those where it's easy to trap yourself in a tight corner or back over a cliff, but mostly, Eternal's level design provides plenty of opportunities to zip around like a bat out of hell, constantly finding your next target and assessing if you need to set it on fire, freeze it, cut it in half, tear it apart, or some combination of all of them. It all makes just about every fight feel like a speeding train seconds from going off the rails, with disaster only averted because you're so damn good at killing stuff. Once you get the rhythm of Doom Eternal, it becomes a brilliant extension of what made Doom 2016 so cool.Between battles, you spend your time using Eternal's mobility to navigate its sprawling, twisting levels, and to uncover myriad secret locations that hide upgrades and weapon mods. There's an even bigger emphasis on platforming than in Doom 2016, and puzzling through the environments to get around provides a welcome breather between fights. Some of the platforming can be a bit trying at times, especially when you need to clear big gaps to grab distant monkey bars or hit sticky walls you can climb. For the most part, though, navigating the environment is almost as much fun as smashing through Hell's armies. These portions are also pretty forgiving, thanks to the fact that falling into the abyss now only penalizes you with a small loss of health instead of instant death.The campaign took me around 16 hours to complete, and that included tracking down the vast majority of secrets and completing a lot of the optional fights that earn you additional upgrade points. Running throughout is a pretty involved story, which feels like a fundamental shift from the satirical, jokey tale of Doom 2016. Where that game put you in the Praetor suit of a Doomslayer who literally destroyed the radios trying to provide context for his endless massacres, Doom Eternal is much more self-serious, constantly spewing proper nouns and character names as if you're intimately familiar with all the actors leading Hell's invasion of Earth. Some of the humor of the last game remains, but the majority is all pretty tough to follow if you don't spend time reading through the many collectible lore drops scattered around every level. Thankfully, keeping up with Eternal's confusing plot isn't really a necessary component of enjoying the game.In addition to the main campaign, Doom Eternal also includes a multiplayer mode called Battlemode. It foregoes the more traditional deathmatch approach of Doom 2016, in which a bunch of players grab the Doom Slayer's weapons and shoot each other, for an experience in which one combatant takes on the role of the Slayer, fighting a team of two opponents who play as demons.The Slayer-versus-demons approach of Eternal's multiplayer helps maintain the puzzle-like feel of its combat, while ratcheting up the challenge by giving demons the ability to strategize and work together. Demons also have a bunch of special abilities--they can summon smaller enemies to fight for them, block the Slayer's ability to pick up loot for a short time to stop them from healing, create traps, or share buffs. Battlemode is an interesting take on Eternal's battles, requiring you to use all your skills against intelligent enemies as the Slayer and to execute coordinated assaults as the relatively weaker demons. Playing as the demons puts things at a slower pace but captures a different, more tactical aspect of the battle calculations that are central to Doom Eternal's gameplay.Eternal's multiplayer is a fun change of pace, especially with the opportunity to play as the demons, but its steep learning curve means it's a bit alienating to drop into, particularly if you haven't put significant time into the campaign. There's a lot to keep in mind no matter what role you take on in Battlemode, making it a tough multiplayer experience to get good at. The mode also doesn't add too much variety to the Eternal formula--for Slayer players, it's mostly just a more challenging version of Eternal's campaign. Taking on the demon role lets you try one of five different hellions, but while each plays a little differently, the gist of each is pretty much the same: Summon demons, shoot the Slayer. Battlemode is a nice diversion, but it's not the major draw of Eternal by any stretch, and the novelty of facing off against other humans doesn't add much to the game's underlying formula.Though it can take a bit to get the hang of it, the intricacies of Doom Eternal's combat, combined with its enhanced mobility and option-heavy level design, create a ton of white-knuckle moments that elevate everything that made Doom 2016 work so well. Its combat is just as quick and chaotic, but requires you to constantly analyze everything that's happening in order to come out victorious. Once you get the hang of the rhythm of Doom Eternal, it'll make you feel like a demon-slaying savant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15357b78-783f-4820-b9c1-27a6eab99dc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "15357b78-783f-4820-b9c1-27a6eab99dc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "172361c3-7796-40ad-9ef6-371a3848715d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f195efae72f8d434ed71c87c996f149e7df2775ea2cca55889d015050342de0"}, "3": {"node_id": "f28d66a7-b5e1-4d0c-9ff9-35e712bc0cd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff6d038eb968b623c784eb84e21019ebff1817222a5b817f7a79a8bd12a347b2"}}, "hash": "d9043197146fdecacd2c5facfebd2e761a88ca17c458e711dc46d4fa972e1a05", "text": "Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:Doom Eternal\u2019s power fantasy is funny, playful, and a welcome breakHave you ever noticed how cop procedurals will signal that a messy-haired teenager is a real loner type by showing him playing a video game, sitting in a dark bedroom littered with junk food, the walls covered in heavy metal posters? The game itself (because we always get to see gameplay, even though the show clearly can\u2019t afford good computer animation) appears to be a parody of violent video games, all disembowelment and close-range executions. The teen, played by a 20-something actor, manhandles his poor controller, suggesting the game is either astonishingly complex or the teenager is dumb as a rock. That\u2019s Doom Eternal. All of it. The Mountain Dew and Cheetos. The Dream Theater albums. The hand-cramping controls. And the overwhelming sense that everybody involved is in on the joke, and having a good time. That lack of shame makes all the difference. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

You move from point A to point B, killing everything in between. Sometimes you need a keycard to open a locked door. Most of the time, you simply need to kill something a little more challenging than the thing you killed in the previous room. The story picks up where Doom (2016) left off: Demons have overtaken Earth. You are a literal one-man army, on the path to becoming either a god or a killer of gods. Your quest to kill three space witches will take you from the aforementioned demon-infested Earth to a demon-infested Mars and back, with some pit stops at your space base, the Fortress of Doom, a hybrid space station and medieval castle floating somewhere (best I can tell) near the moon. Doom Eternal is like Doom (2016) but with greater scope and clearer intent. Doom (2016) infamously fell into development hell, with its developer, id, spending years reimagining the project like a person in a desert chasing after hallucinations before finally locating actual water. Doom (2016) felt like a game that happened despite itself. Doom Eternal, on the other hand, feels purposeful, like every team member had strived for one goal: to turn the magic of death-metal album covers into a video game. Friends, they did it.Everything is more \u201cbadass\u201d (and I never say the word \u201cbadass\u201d). The super shotgun has a grappling hook that can catch demons on fire. Badass! You can tell how badly a demon is injured by how much skin and muscle you\u2019ve blasted off its skeleton. Badass! Instead of a pistol, you start the game with a shotgun. Badass!Developer id and publisher Bethesda have invested small mountains of money in cutscenes, but even our hero seems bored by them, never saying a word, literally walking through the cinematics, and cutting one-sided conversations short with the occasional bullet to the noggin. He doesn\u2019t have time for all this fantasy lore baloney; he has evil to tear apart. His name is Doomguy. What else can you expect? My inner teenager has a soft spot for the aesthetic, but what makes Doom Eternal special isn\u2019t what you see when you play, but what you feel. And what you feel ... it\u2019s like dancing. The movement is a pleasure. With ease, I\u2019m gliding across the floor and through the air, choosing the best steps to maintain momentum and grace, seamlessly swapping between partners that I twirl, toss, and gut like a fish. It\u2019s a ballet, albeit drenched in viscera and set to crunching guitar riffs.

Each demon is a living pi\u00f1ata, spewing health and armor energy when you perform a well-timed melee kill or light them aflame with your shoulder-mounted flamethrower \u2014 a new addition to the series. Finding the perfect rhythm of fire, bullets, and melee turns demons into humanoid sprinklers that spurt green and blue tokens, accompanied by a euphoric metallic sound effect that\u2019s similar to a slot machine dropping coins.Rapidly, you meet bigger, stronger, and deadlier enemies that just so happen to be susceptible to whichever new weapon is waiting nearby. A sniper shot or a sticky grenade removes turrets off the spine of a giant, anthropomorphic brain. Heat-seeking rockets chase a teleporting hell ghoul. A turret shield provides a moment to catch your breath in the middle of a fight, while also peeling the flesh off a demon like an orange.On the surface, Doom Eternal is a callback to everything that led the gaming industry to form its own ratings board: a celebration of violence, a fetishization of heavy weapons, and a flirtation with the satanic arts. Under that surface, though, lies an intricate and outstanding feat of balance, an act of creative maturity that suggests years of experience in not merely making this sort of game, but making it look easy. Every option for violence in the game, every weapon and encounter, contributes to the action holistically, like an elaborate upgrade of roshambo. When it clicks for you \u2014 when you instinctively know to use a freezing grenade (also new to this entry) to slow a powerful demon, light a creeping horde on fire for its abundance of armor, send a flaming arrow into a flying beast, smash the flaming horde for health, and then cleave the original frozen baddie in half right before it thaws \u2014 you feel like Doomguy. And Doomguy feels like a god. It takes a lot of smarts to make something that often sounds stupid while feeling so exhilarating and mentally taxing. That dichotomy of great skill being applied to the absurd adventure of a demon slayer is precisely why I adore Doom as a series. It\u2019s why Polygon named Doom Eternal\u2019s predecessor, which was only called Doom, our game of the year in 2016. The series provides silly, meathead escapism while often concealing the engineering, craftsmanship, artistry, and risk-taking necessary to produce a game that looks this familiar, yet feels fresh.Doom Eternal stands apart from its contemporaries, the big, gaudy, self-serious first-person shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield that demand instant, microscopic movements to perform headshots in order to survive against preternaturally gifted teens. Competitive players of those franchises grapple with each patch\u2019s meta, while memorizing maps, angles, and weapon advantages. It\u2019s a popular approach to AAA first-person shooter design, but for all the grand scope and spectacle, the \u201cfun\u201d of these shooters largely takes place down the sights of a gun. Only one weapon in Doom Eternal includes a traditional scope, and it\u2019s an optional upgrade. Ammo can be found in the chest cavity of every enemy, so there\u2019s no need to be precious about firing from the hip.In Doom Eternal, the \u201cfun\u201d is in the movement. Because you must restore health and armor with close-range attacks, moving in and out of scrimmages becomes the foundation of winning strategies. A double jump, a double dash, and a hook that pulls you toward its living target all allow you to establish your distance, as do environments sprinkled with walls, hills, tunnels, platforms, and monkey bars \u2014 all meant to be used for cover and escape, but also your own amusement.Despite having weapons that can bring instant death to an entire room, you can\u2019t survive exclusively by playing aggressively, because one wave of enemies typically gives way to another wave, and then another. A good fight requires constant decision-making: which weapon to use against which enemy, what ammo to conserve, when to mine weak demons for health, and when to rip out the biggest enemy\u2019s soul.Between the dozens of action set-pieces, id has added a bunch of platforming sequences that are fine. They\u2019re just fine. Listen: In most cases, first-person platforming in video games feels like a crime, but I rarely felt frustrated when jumping across hundred-foot chasms at supercar speeds. For the most part, the platforming exists to showcase the gargantuan environments, moving the franchise far outside its roots in claustrophobic corridors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd1aee4b-3cdd-4fd1-bca0-fc53e59670c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd1aee4b-3cdd-4fd1-bca0-fc53e59670c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "f28d66a7-b5e1-4d0c-9ff9-35e712bc0cd7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff6d038eb968b623c784eb84e21019ebff1817222a5b817f7a79a8bd12a347b2"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb6d0356-c72b-438d-aff8-bcd191706f2d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a7ad5bb62a4f8671ffb1bee15a0f3980dae370d82924745548899b2d70416a40"}}, "hash": "4b8af9be1a942e7d08adda51f515586a88701fe71bbc9a9d717218576ca92b56", "text": "Doom Eternal understands scope, and is willing to go big to hammer home the fact that the demons are a legitimate threat to the planet, not just to a dimly lit moon base or spaceship.  The game struggles only when something forces you to stop.One stage in Doom Eternal\u2019s midsection hews closely to the Call of Duty formula, favoring cramped, linear hallways and floors covered in purple goo that literally slows the action, preventing the all-important dashing and jumping. The recurring joke about demons being \u201cmortally challenged\u201d is a buzzkill, knocking the smile off my face every single irritating time it\u2019s delivered. And then the final third of the game introduces swimming. On dry land, Doom Eternal is an improvised dance. Underwater, the game devolves into pin the tail on the donkey. Movement while swimming is stilted. It\u2019s hard to see. And the only goal is to fumble about in search of the right glowing target to smash, hoping it will bring an end to the supposedly fun distraction. Late stages sometimes trade the skate park-style arenas of the early acts for large, simple open spaces larded with tons of boss-tier demons. On a few occasions, an adrenaline-fueled run came to a full stop when I found myself stuck between a few large enemies and the world\u2019s geometry, unable to run, jump, or dash. I was stuck, helpless, waiting to die. One enemy, the Marauder, requires singular focus, more akin to a Dark Souls flavor of combat. This encounter would be fine on its own, but, like all of the game\u2019s flaws, it brings the momentum to a joyless halt. Yes, the second half has its blemishes (or, to go back to our dancing metaphor, its missteps). And that\u2019s reasonable. Doom Eternal has one of the strongest, leanest, and most confident first halves of any action game, or really, any big-budget game ever. But let me be clear: This isn\u2019t the point in the review where I tell you the second half is a disappointment. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s great, and at times near perfection. You know, the times when it\u2019s not asking me to swim in poisonous acid to unlock another door.I want to tell you more, especially about the developer\u2019s generosity of design. All the cheat codes you can unlock, the toys you can collect, the fortress you can decorate and explore. I\u2019d love to spoil all of it, but I won\u2019t. You should discover the specifics on your own.Treat Doom Eternal like dessert \u2014 something to be savored, not hurried. When you have the rare moment between feeding one demon its own heart and breaking another demon\u2019s arm and hammering the freshly protruding bone through the demon\u2019s skull, take a breath to admire the engineering and artistry that makes your actions possible, how the world encourages playful movement, how the specific design of an arena and the placement of each enemy invites you to chain your violence in one ecstatic flourish. Always be moving, but never rush.Lee Ann Womack put it best: I hope you dance.

That means more mobility, more demons, more weapon mods and upgrades, more resource management\u2026 The list could go on and on, and frankly it's hard to think of a single aspect of Doom 2016 that hasn't been absolutely red-lined in this sequel.That kind of escalation is arguably appropriate for a franchise as over-the-top and self-awarely absurd as Doom, but there are just so many pistons and gears whirring away under the hood here that you sometimes start to feel them grinding against each other a little when the action heats up. But then, when all the machinery is humming along just right and everything works in harmony, Doom Eternal offers some of the most frantic and overwhelming shooter action in history.The 2016 Doom reboot, or reimagining, or whatever you want to call it, left such a profound impression on me that I can't help filtering my thoughts about Eternal through a direct comparison. The sequel picks back up with the same template--shoot demons to kill them, chainsaw them when you need ammo, rip them in half when you need health, double-jump and mantle away from them when you need breathing room--and then builds outward in every conceivable direction. There's now a flamethrower that works for armor the way the chainsaw does for ammo. You get not one but two types of grenades, concussive and freeze, that you can rapidly toggle between. Your basic melee turns into an area-of-effect \"blood punch\" when you charge it up with enough of the health-yielding glory kills. All of these have meters and cooldowns to keep an eye on in the corners of the UI.In addition, the two new elements that have the biggest impact on the flow of the combat are the double dash and the addition of weak points on heavier enemies that let you suppress their deadlier attacks. Much like the double jump, the dash lets you pop off two quick horizontal movements in any direction, on the ground or in the air, which has obvious implications for getting around the combat space quickly. And dealing with the weak points is crucial for threat management. Blowing off the mancubus' arm cannons or the back-mounted gun on the arachnotron, or shoving a sticky bomb down the gullet of a cacodemon, is an immediate priority whenever those enemies come on the scene, purely because of how dangerous those attacks are and how urgent it is to disable them as a result. Both of these are great ideas on paper that add to the variety of the action early on in the campaign (although the game does have a penchant for utilizing the air dash in occasional jumping puzzles that aren't really its strong suit).This full loadout of new and old abilities offers you an amazing range of tactical options in a heavy firefight, and in an ideal setting, such as the Slayer Gate challenge arenas that constitute the purest and most intense combat sequences in the game, they lead to a level of intensity that's above and beyond possibly any other first-person shooter I've played. I honestly found myself short of breath at the end of a couple of the Slayer Gates, after 10 frantic minutes of feeling like I was just barely hanging on before finally eking out a victory. But at the speed Doom Eternal runs at, it can be easy to forget you have some of those abilities at your disposal, or lose track of which ones are off cooldown, when the game is forcing you to make one split-second decision after another. The dash is fantastic for getting you around an arena quickly, but you can also find yourself dashing back into a corner without meaning to and getting boxed in by enemies, or dashing into one of the many monkey bars scattered around the levels, accidentally diverting yourself midair. And quickly popping off those weak point shots becomes a matter of survival the more enemies the game throws at you, which can cause things to spin out of control rapidly when you miss more than a couple of times.All this means that playing Doom Eternal felt like a series of highs and lows rather than the 20-plus-hour nonstop high I expected. At its best, the game is a breakneck, exhilarating, barely controllable dance of damage output, maneuvering, crowd control, and leapfrogging resource management, and it's so much fun when everything is working sublimely that it's all the more jarring when one aspect of it or another feels like it gets in the way. I suspect that some of this, especially the issue with weak points, comes down to the way I played Doom Eternal, which was on a PlayStation 4 Pro on Ultra-Violence (i.e. hard).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e2facbd-ffda-42ce-901a-56bd458b76f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e2facbd-ffda-42ce-901a-56bd458b76f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb6d0356-c72b-438d-aff8-bcd191706f2d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a7ad5bb62a4f8671ffb1bee15a0f3980dae370d82924745548899b2d70416a40"}, "3": {"node_id": "80995d70-51d8-4a29-8d99-24f650c740cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a98de7e1039bb738919c0dc36dcbb624ee638ffb53574ed83f58d81a9f076dd"}}, "hash": "c9e8f5efb357ce0dca6becb3af33a4f91c7ee69bc947d26d0ad8f1254295ffcd", "text": "hard). That's also how I played through Doom 2016, and I emerged from that experience confidently declaring it one of the best shooters ever made. So I felt I had to apply the same benchmark to Eternal, which in the last handful of hours felt tougher to play well on a controller than its predecessor. Analog sticks aren't as well suited as a mouse to nailing the small moving targets (including literal headshots in a late-game boss fight) that you need to hit reliably to survive, and there are so many abilities and toggles mapped to face buttons that taking your thumbs off the sticks at the wrong time, and thus losing the ability to move or aim or both for even a split second, can be flat out deadly late in the game. That's hardly to say Eternal is unplayable on consoles, but I just felt more at ease with the game's specific mechanics and requirements in the hours I spent playing it on PC, even on Nightmare. Frankly I can admire the audacity of making a shooter so demanding that it almost feels like it requires a mouse at higher difficulties, and in hindsight that's how I wish I'd played it, but at any rate it's something to be aware of depending on your choice of platform.That's a lot of words about the pure combat experience of Doom Eternal, but there's a ton of other stuff built around that core action. There's now a hub area, which is a literal gothic-sci-fi castle floating in space, that you return to in between levels. This home base helps act as a wrapper for the game's numerous upgrade systems, which initially look like a lot to take in but are really no more complex or unmanageable than those in Doom 2016. Weapon mods (which there are more of) can still be upgraded and then put through mastery challenges to unlock their ultimate forms. Passive upgrades, which fall into two categories, enhance your movement, various damage resistances, grenade attributes, and so forth. And the runes from the previous game also return as a sort of perk system, letting you equip three really meaningful bonuses at any one time from a pool of things like a last-stand chance to regain some health when you \"die,\" increased range on glory kills, and slowing down time when you use a weapon mod in the air. To the game's credit, as punishing and sometimes irksome as I found some of the later levels, it did force me to reexamine the rune loadout I had settled into using for most of the game, and changing things up there made a big difference in how I got through a couple of the rougher spots.It still seems improbable even now, but somehow Doom 2016 had a hilariously self-aware story--about the corporate exploitation of Hell and the Doom guy's ferocious dispensation of divine justice--that felt like it walked a fine line between being extremely serious and not remotely serious. The key to that balance was the overt disdain the player character himself displayed for everything going on around him, but here, the Doom guy is a more willing and eager participant in a much wider ranging story that features demon priests, spectral warrior kings, a fallen interdimensional empire, and an array of other elements that feels like it's attempting to build up a quantity of elaborate, faux-Biblical lore. I did enjoy the game's take on the clash between Heaven and Hell and its unusual conception of a celestial host pulling strings behind the scenes, but what felt like a wry commentary on man's arrogance and greed in the first game has taken a backseat to straight up backstory here, an attempt to create something akin to a Doom cinematic universe which fills in some blanks from the previous game that I would have rather remained unfilled.One way that Eternal certainly brings it just as strongly as the 2016 game did is in the sights and sounds. Where the previous game's setting was pretty much limited to a generic sci-fi facility, the red sands of Mars, and a couple of expeditions into Hell, Doom Eternal sends you all over the place to multiple hotspots on the demon-occupied Earth, several locations in the interdimensional outworld, and deep into the bowels of Hell's most insidious strongholds. Eternal's art design feels like it recognizes and embraces its adolescent roots, and some of the late-game levels in particular offer some really gnarly, fire-and-brimstone depictions of infernal human suffering that land somewhere between Milton and Iron Maiden. The graphical fidelity is still top notch and the game still runs smooth as butter, even on consoles, and I have to give special credit to the location-specific damage tech in this game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80995d70-51d8-4a29-8d99-24f650c740cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "80995d70-51d8-4a29-8d99-24f650c740cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e2facbd-ffda-42ce-901a-56bd458b76f9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9e8f5efb357ce0dca6becb3af33a4f91c7ee69bc947d26d0ad8f1254295ffcd"}, "3": {"node_id": "06b71623-e397-4790-a5e3-49b15dc78686", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c7d4b92c0bdebe7557ac005e681fd8c264fe729b4c305f34a37f42a6923221b"}}, "hash": "5a98de7e1039bb738919c0dc36dcbb624ee638ffb53574ed83f58d81a9f076dd", "text": "Having enemies take damage exactly where you shoot them might seem like old hat these days, but Doom Eternal takes it to such an absurd degree that it really stands out when you peel big, meaty chunks of flesh off the bigger enemies with every blast of the super shotgun, and by the time you're almost done with bruisers like the hell knight, they can half look like a bloody skeleton still chasing you around. Focusing on that kind of tech feels like another fun throwback to the days of shooter engine one-upmanship, when games like Soldier of Fortune II put that kind of thing right on the back of the box.The previous Doom's multiplayer options were perfunctory at best, and here Eternal improves significantly with the new Battlemode, a round-based, asymmetric two-on-one versus mode with two players taking control of a demon, including the mancubus, revenant, and arch-vile, and the third playing as the Doom marine with his full bag of tricks from the campaign. Each demon type has a range of unique special abilities (some of which let you spawn other heavy demons in), and the arena is also populated with plenty of AI fodder enemies, which means the Doom guy player can really have their hands full. And both sides get to choose from a handful of perks as the rounds progress that enhance certain abilities or change the flow of combat. I found Battlemode more engaging playing as the Doom marine, though it seems like the more time you spent with the demons the more you'd get a feel for using their abilities to really muck things up for the third player. Throwing a couple of human players into the enemy mix is a clever way to further intensify the game's already complex and varied combat model, and I actually wouldn't mind going back to Battlemode now and then, which is more than I could say for Doom 2016's multiplayer.One thing I can say without reservation about Doom Eternal is that it's ambitious as hell. The devs at id weren't content to just pop out a new set of levels with one new weapon and a couple of enemies (which, ironically, is how the original Doom II came about). Instead they included an enormous roster of new ideas both obvious and unexpected, and took these additions and enhancements to over-the-top extremes. Eternal may not have quite the same purity of focus as its predecessor, but it's so relentless about throwing everything in its toolbox at you at a thousand miles an hour that it's often hard to stop and notice. \u00a9 2023 FANDOM, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\nUse your keyboard!Log in to comment\nKotaku, 2016\u2019s Doom reimagined the classic shooter into a frantic but modern mold. The bloody escapades of the Doom Slayer were rife with bullets and guts. It was a grimy video game hamburger. Doom Eternal is bigger and bloodier, almost to the point of excess. It\u2019s the same hamburger dipped into a vat of delicious special sauce. Except the serving size is so big that it\u2019s hard not to feel a little sick afterwards.Nonetheless Doom Eternal is incredible. It is a hellaciously bold step forward from the soft-rebooted series that will satisfy even the stodgiest of old school Doom fans. If you want to rip and tear, there\u2019s arguably no better place than Doom Eternal. It also wants to juggle too many balls. There are additions to the combat system, a slew of unlockable items, online multiplayer pitting man against demons, dozens of gun upgrades, a lot more ancient lore, and story connections to older games that offer surprising revelations. Doom Eternal operates on a single maxim: more, more, more. Much of this works, some of it is a harmless annoyance, and a few things are actively frustrating. The frustrating parts don\u2019t prevent Doom Eternal from being a great game, but they are there. They show themselves with every tutorial pop-up, cosmetic reward, or late addition to the game\u2019s fabulous but increasingly busy combat.Does it matter if most players are just here for violence and good times, as opposed to all that other stuff? Probably not. Doom Eternal lives by the strength of its shooting, and with a few notable competitors like Titanfall 2, there\u2019s nothing that comes close to delivering this level of excitement. Doom Eternal is set two years after 2016\u2019s Doom. Earth has been invaded by demonic legions who have wiped out most of the population. These forces are led by a strange angel-like being called the Khan Maykr and a trio of \u201cHell Priests\u201d that are responsible for summoning and empowering the horde.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06b71623-e397-4790-a5e3-49b15dc78686": {"__data__": {"id_": "06b71623-e397-4790-a5e3-49b15dc78686", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "80995d70-51d8-4a29-8d99-24f650c740cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a98de7e1039bb738919c0dc36dcbb624ee638ffb53574ed83f58d81a9f076dd"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4bbfa53-692b-449d-9881-418bbdf16260", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4bceb94080b8f7bab60bd21580bc1830787fc7a728754a64707a0e4a25fd68e8"}}, "hash": "0c7d4b92c0bdebe7557ac005e681fd8c264fe729b4c305f34a37f42a6923221b", "text": "The Doom Slayer, our ever-helmeted and mindlessly violent hero, returns to Earth to hunt down the Hell Priests and put an end to the invasion. His quest will take him through multiple dimensions and reveal secrets about the life he lived before he became a legendary warrior. Narratively, Doom Eternal has more going on than what came before. The lines between legend and reality become less blurred, and closely guarded secrets and plots get revealed in the process. Who is the Doom Slayer? What really fuels \u201cargent energy,\u201d the seemingly infinite power supply that corporations sought in the previous game, which the Khan Maykr also seems to covet? If you somehow wanted answers to those questions, Doom Eternal\u2019s story will deliver them, and it will do so with a clumsy confidence.The premise is the same as ever: there are demons that need killing and countless ways for you to fuck them up beyond recognition. Doom Eternal contains the same core combat loop as 2016\u2019s Doom. Wounding enemies will cause them to flash into a vulnerable state during which they can be annihilated with a \u201cglory kill.\u201d These astoundingly violent finishing moves, a canonization of Brutal Doom\u2019s fatalities, cause enemies to explode in a burst of blood and health pickups. You dart around, injure enemies, zoom in, smash their skulls in to keep your health up, bust out and keep killing. It\u2019s hard to understate how satisfying this core combat loop is. There is just enough strategy at play. Should I waste time weakening zombie fodder so I can get some easy health back or keep focusing on that Arachnotron chasing me? Should I use my chainsaw now, cutting an enemy in half and gaining ammo pickups in the process, or save it until I have enough gasoline to bisect tougher enemies in the blink of an eye? This satisfying loop congeals into something that\u2019s both incredibly deep and mind-numbingly simple. Sometimes you methodically choose foes, sometimes you bust out your rocket launcher and blow everything into sticky goo.2016\u2019s Doom combat was a straightforward but deliberate dance. Doom Eternal transforms it into an elbow-throwing pit mosh, building upon its core loop by adding on a variety of tools and tactics. These options are sometimes overwhelming. As more and more upgrades are unlocked, combat bloats with possibilities. It can be hard to track all your options when you\u2019re getting bum-rushed by a Baron of Hell or blasted by a Mancubus. However, using these options to their full advantage can crank combat up ten to twenty points on the dial.First and foremost is the addition of the Flame Belch, a short flamethrower attack that causes minuscule damage but has one key benefit: any enemy lit on fire will generate armor when shot or killed. It\u2019s easy to dismiss the Flame Belch as a useless gizmo when you first acquire it. Glory kills make health generation easy and while Doom Eternal is a more difficult game than its predecessor, the early levels are relatively tame. There\u2019s not an overwhelming need for armor when you\u2019re already incredibly mobile and can rip gargoyles in half for a health-restoring blood shower. As the game progresses, the Flame Belch proves more useful. Enemies grow more aggressive and their compositions hold dangerous elite monsters. Learning to douse minor enemies in flames and blow them into armor-granting bits becomes much more essential. It\u2019s a welcome tool, although it does highlight what\u2019s bound to be a point of conversation and contention between players: is there too much stuff?Because, to reiterate, there is a hell of a lot of stuff. In addition to the Flame Belch, players have access to frag and ice grenades that can blow up clusters of enemies or freeze them in place. Each weapon has two different variations that can be unlocked. The Heavy Cannon, a reliable machine gun, can fire miniature missiles or be used as a sort of sniper rifle. The Plasma Rifle can be upgraded with a powerful explosive wave ability or a lock-on microwave beam that blows enemies up when they die. There are runes to discover that unlock permanent powers, like the ability to slow down time when you aim in the air or increase your dash speed. Enemies have weak points on their body that are best handled by specific weapons and firing modes. Is that cacodemon opening their mouth? Better fire a grenade from your modified shotgun. That angelic priest is firing from a distance? You can instantly kill them with a Heavy Cannon precision bolt shot to their skull.

Immediately started a fresh Ultra-Violence playthrough and am enjoying immensely. That sounds good, right? It is, but these flourishes and additions don\u2019t come without complications, and at times, Doom Eternal\u2019s combat feels almost too busy. The core loop that drove 2016\u2019s Doom to success is occasionally lost in all of the cooldowns, subweapons, and supercharged \u201cBlood Punches.\u201d The special sauce oozes over the hamburger so much that you sometimes lose the beef\u2019s flavor. I expect some disagreement on this point, but while I never begrudged Doom Eternal\u2019s additions, I\u2019d be lying if I said that I didn\u2019t occasionally lose track of when my ice grenades were off cooldown. This problem is fixed in the moments when Doom Eternal demands the most of the player. In choice encounters, you\u2019ll exhaust all your dashes and double jumps, fling a grenade on Flame Belch\u2019d enemies for armor shards and grapple into an enemy\u2019s face with your super shotgun\u2019s meat hook attachment. If you\u2019re playing on the default difficulty, these moments of intense performance aren\u2019t as common as they should be. Doom Eternal takes time before it diversifies the enemy pool; the opening of the game is particularly tame. I found myself craving the moments where I could unlock Slayer Gates, which are hidden challenges featuring devilish monster groupings with boss enemies thoroughly mixed in for good measure. If you\u2019re a Doom aficionado, it\u2019s best to crack the difficult up right away if you want to get the most out of the combat. Doom works best when it is mean. It shines brightest in the moments that it follows in the footsteps of WADs like The Plutonia Experiment, or even John Romero\u2019s recent Sigil.All of this expressed in a single enemy new to Doom Eternal: the Marauder. Marauders are the most \u201cmodern\u201d feeling enemy in the game, to the point that they could be right at home in an action game like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Marauders pose a unique challenge. Get too close and they will instantly blast you with their shotgun. Move too far away and they slice energy waves at you with their massive axe. When they want to be extra annoying, Marauders can summon a wolf-spirit to chase down the player. Their design bucks against the norm. Doom challenges are usually all about the player needing to be aggressive, but Marauders can only be attacked during key windows of opportunity, else they block everything with a powerful shield. Fighting one-on-one is busy enough. Drop one of these bastards into a horde and an encounter becomes truly difficult. Lord help you if there\u2019s an arch-vile around who might revive fallen minions as well. Compared to older enemies like charging Hell Knights and soul-spewing Pain Elementals, Marauders feel over-tuned and arguably out of place. If Doom Eternal has \u201ctoo many notes,\u201d then these bastards are an entire symphony unto themselves. Nevertheless, it works..Bosses, on the other hand, never reach such lofty heights. This is especially true with the final two boss battles. There\u2019s little strategy involved in them except shooting at a slightly bigger enemy, and while that arguably makes sense for Doom, the results are boring. The sights are grand and there\u2019s plenty of blood bits, but it never feels as complex or gratifying as it should. Difficulty comes through waves of minions and hazards that limit where you can move. Instead of monumental battles with titans, these are confusing and messy showdowns with foes you don\u2019t really give a shit about.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e05d62bd-fd3a-421d-841f-06f765d5e88e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e05d62bd-fd3a-421d-841f-06f765d5e88e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4bbfa53-692b-449d-9881-418bbdf16260", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4bceb94080b8f7bab60bd21580bc1830787fc7a728754a64707a0e4a25fd68e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "5df5a66e-49a2-4ba7-b709-b4c751291f3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "be7bf47a56f3d3713daef742951a7b1966de563803cb5f9c6fd4fd1e936c3fa8"}}, "hash": "f87327b13bca628845933f15945f20b192a65fa38d356e3c19eae0795598dae3", "text": "You\u2019ll die, sure, but rarely at their hands. Usually, a spare imp or strange angelic priest will swoop in through a blindspot. That\u2019s Doom Eternal\u2019s combat, for good and ill. Loud, busy, and excessive regardless of the consequences. You either fall in line or get gibbed.This is also apparent in the game\u2019s multiplayer \u201cBattlemode,\u201d a one-versus-two match in which one player is the Doom Slayer and the other two play as demons. It\u2019s often a fun challenge but the fact that Doom Eternal pushes this forward as the main multiplayer option and not simply a deathmatch mode is puzzling. In Battlemode, the two players who are demons get to team up with AI enemies so that the Doom Slayer can perform glory kills to earn health or chainsaw for ammo. But the chaos, while occasionally fun, started to bore me after a handful of matches. It\u2019s another case where more doesn\u2019t mean \u201cbetter.\u201d There\u2019s also a Dark Souls-esque invasion mechanic\u2014to be released in a post-launch patch\u2014that will let players \u201cinvade\u201d someone\u2019s story campaign as a demon and try to take them out. That sounds cool on paper, and while I\u2019m sure it might be fun from time to time, I also find myself scratching my head at it. To paraphrase my bud Adam Jensen: nobody asked for this. I admire the attempts to experiment with the Doom format, but I can\u2019t muster any excitement for what that experimentation has ended up looking like in Doom Eternal\u2019s multiplayer. Doom 2016\u2019s deathmatch modes were met with derision on release, but sometimes all you want to do is drop into a free-for-all. The classics are classic for a reason. You can have your Battlemode, Bethesda. But I\u2019d also like the option to simply jump into arena with some people and some fuckin\u2019 guns, y\u2019know?The idea of \u201cmore\u201d somehow being better is the culprit behind Doom Eternal\u2019s most exhausting decisions. . The things I like the least about Doom Eternal are the wrappings surrounding combat. On the mild end of the spectrum, that means the excessive upgrade trees and weapon modifications. Sometimes a shotgun should just be a shotgun. But in Doom Eternal, it\u2019s all about the upgrades. This happened in 2016\u2019s Doom as well, but there\u2019s way more of it here. You\u2019ll gain upgrades for your guns. You\u2019ll gain upgrades to your power suit. You\u2019ll gain upgrades for your runes. You\u2019ll gain upgrades for your punches. There\u2019s fast travel for exploring levels and a base to explore between missions. These additions feel unnecessary and sometimes pointless. I was never excited to find an upgrade hidden in a secret location. It always felt like a chore when I earned upgrade points or found energy cells to unlock one of the many locked doors in my home base. It\u2019s one thing for Doom Eternal\u2019s combat to churn with options; it\u2019s more annoying when everything around it also feels so busy. For a game about blowing shit up, there\u2019s a lot of menu navigation. In the worst cases, there are pop ups about how to unlock such-and-such feature and even messages on how to defeat bosses. Many of these notifications can be disabled, but the associated web of collectables, progression systems, unlockable skins, and bonuses is harder to ignore and it adds little that\u2019s worthwhile to the experience.Doom Eternal\u2019s story is muddy and not told well. World-shaking stakes and brutal displays of villainy mix with a presentation that is disjointed and assumes far more investment on the part of the player than will likely exist. While die-hard fans might be content to speculate about the true nature of cyborg scientist Samuel Hayden and the nature of Doom\u2019s cosmology, the fact of the matter is that it\u2019s just not interesting.Doom Eternal takes the lore of 2016\u2019s Doom\u2014which mostly entailed hazy religious texts and legends of the near-mythical Doom Slayer\u2014and makes everything more explicit. It confirms a fan theory. The Doom Slayer isn\u2019t just anyone; it turns out that he\u2019s the hero from the original Doom, Doom 2, and Doom 64. Following those games, he wandered Hell until he was found by the Maykrs and eventually joined an ancient order of demon slayers called the Night Sentinels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5df5a66e-49a2-4ba7-b709-b4c751291f3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5df5a66e-49a2-4ba7-b709-b4c751291f3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "e05d62bd-fd3a-421d-841f-06f765d5e88e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f87327b13bca628845933f15945f20b192a65fa38d356e3c19eae0795598dae3"}, "3": {"node_id": "4674ae99-0ba4-4673-84c5-d32505cd989f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ec7cc6841849195fd5aef55e24934576056379bca9e727cad55359209033409"}}, "hash": "be7bf47a56f3d3713daef742951a7b1966de563803cb5f9c6fd4fd1e936c3fa8", "text": "The Maykr society faced upheaval and a mysterious hooded-man imbued him with otherworldly strength.What does all this lore add to the proceedings? It\u2019s hard to say. Doom Eternal drips with an unearned self-seriousness. It bends and twists to weave a larger canon without any real purpose besides adding artificial weight to the story. Where MachineGames reimagined Wolfenstein\u2019s B.J. Blazkowicz into a world-weary soldier and used its Nazi-packed setting to mix pulp and social commentary, Doom Eternal begs to be taken seriously without any real reason to oblige.You can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too, and Doom Eternal shifts between far-out Heavy Metal hijinks and storied lore without combining the two into a coherent package. It\u2019s easy to say that this doesn\u2019t matter. After all, Doom\u2019s all about the shooty times. But 2016\u2019s Doom proved that it was possible to have all the zombie-smashing you wanted while weaving in a few interesting ideas. The Union Aerospace Corporation\u2019s thoughtless dash to harvest Hell energy to fuel technological progress was tinged by real-life concerns about global warming, allowing Doom to develop a pointed if straightforward satire of corporate culture. Lore codexes filled with ancient legends of the Doom Slayer painted a meta-texual story about Doom\u2019s cultural cachet. The franchise might as well be a religion to some players. Why not make that explicit within the fiction? Those things worked as spice adding a light but never superficial kick to a straightforward shooter story. Doom Eternal\u2019s world of Hell Priests, ancient Betrayers and warrior orders ultimately feels hollow. It\u2019s not silly or self-aware enough to take lightly. But I also can\u2019t take it seriously and won\u2019t let the grand twist of the Doom Slayer\u2019s identity sucker me into thinking that there\u2019s more going on here than there actually is.This said, the campaign itself is remarkably well-paced. The middle segments drag somewhat but Doom Eternal\u2019s levels and world design ramp up in quality with each passing segment. 2016\u2019s Doom had one glaring sin: it was too long and too drab. Dank steel hallways eventually gave way to Hell\u2019s brownish tones and increasingly bloated combat encounters. Embracing the lore might not work for Doom Eternal\u2019s narrative, but it works wonders for the world design. There are crumpling cities and demon-packed battles through strip malls, Hell valleys littered with wreckage of giant robots and aging titan corpses, a battle through space as massive laser cannons blaze through the stars, and forays into alien dimensions that feel lifted from Destiny. The levels are more imaginative and varied than what came before. In stark contrast to 2016\u2019s Doom, the back half is actually far better than the start. Combat intensity peaks, guns shattering through ancient courtyards and demon sieged skyscrapers. Doom is a series full of iconic levels. Top tier level design and player-creation have allowed for its longevity, unlike other franchises that fizzled out over time, like Turok or F.E.A.R. . I\u2019m happy to say that many of Doom Eternal\u2019s levels\u2014though far from competing with old-school classics\u2014still kick ass. I won\u2019t forget them any time soon.All of this is pulled together by some of the best sound design I\u2019ve heard in a game. Shotguns blast with a chunking clunk, skulls split with slimey slices. Energy weapons rev and thrum with terrifying power, and demons screech with ferocious roars. Weapons in Doom Eternal don\u2019t always have the sense of impact that you might expect, but they certainly sound as powerful as they should. Underneath all of this is a brilliant soundtrack by composer Mick Gordon. The low moments pulse with an uneasy bass and battles explode with intense guitar pounding. I appreciate Doom Eternal\u2019s combat and often found myself enraptured by its vistas, but if there is a singular thing for which it should be recognized, it is the sheer quality of the soundscape.Doom Eternal\u2019s philosophy is simple: make the most intense experience possible. That mostly works out. Combat, while occasionally busy, is sure to satisfy even the most voracious of shooter-mavens.

There are a few sticking points\u2014 a shaky story that\u2019s hard to engage with, the few moments when style trumps substance, a glitch here and there\u2014but there\u2019s no denying that the highs are among the highest you can experience in any first-person shooter. Crank up the difficulty, throw your elbows around, and embrace the chaos. From the deepest diehards to fresh-faced demon slayers, there\u2019s something for everyone to enjoy. Blood, guts, music, mayhem. You might get the occasional bloody nose or interrupted by an unwanted tutorial pop-up, but there\u2019s nothing else like it.\nUSgamer, \nI just leaped at a pole, swung, span 180 degrees and fired a sticky grenade into a cacodemon\u2019s mouth before hitting the floor. When it exploded I dashed forward, jumped, swung again, and stabbed that fucker in its bulging eyeball. All of this happened fluidly, in one smooth motion, in the space of a few seconds. So why, oh why, do I keep accidentally punching every computer terminal, door, and switch I see? In most games, interact being on the same button as something else would be a complete no-no. Remember jumping whenever you tried to open a chest in Dragon Age: Inquisition? Bad. No. Stop that immediately, developers. Stop it now. In Doom, it\u2019s good actually. Hear me out... Interact is on the same button as punch in Doom Eternal, just as it was in Doom 2016, and it means you\u2019re constantly smacking things by accident. I love it. It\u2019s completely in character for Doom Slayer to punch inanimate objects like an angsty teen. In fact, at one point, the game gave me an achievement for punching a gate. That\u2019s because id Software, for the most part, understands what gives Doom its own identity in a world filled with samey first-person shooters. Doom Eternal is self-aware - angry with a cheeky wink. Combat is about pushing forward instead of holding back, running at the thing that\u2019s killing you and using it as a resource, taking what you need from its bloodied corpse... if those chunks of meat can be called a corpse. It\u2019s about meticulously designed arenas that you can navigate backwards at breakneck pace, always shooting. Doom Slayer is rage personified - a mute Kratos, an agent of blind vengeance who doesn\u2019t listen to anyone. He can punch a gate if he wants to. The game welcomes it. Hell, so does the gate. It\u2019s an honour. This sequel is about delivering more of that stuff you loved, faster than before. You don\u2019t even start with a pistol this time - there isn\u2019t one. It starts with a short cutscene and you\u2019re straight into Hell on Earth with a shotgun loaded and ready to go. Within the first hour, your shotgun has a detachable grenade launcher and a rapid fire mod, and you can freely switch between the two with a button tap. You also have an assault rifle, which itself has a scope and rocket silo you can swap out mid-battle. Then there\u2019s your shoulder-mounted grenade launcher. The dial starts at 9 and turns up to 999, I need a doctor. Most of the weapons you find are floating pickups that you run over, automatically pick up, admire, then unload on a demon within seconds. It drip feeds new enemies, new tools, and new tactics constantly. Everything is faster than before.As well as your arsenal, there are a variety of runes you can equip to tweak your gameplay style, and you can have three active at a time. My preference is one that speeds Doom Slayer up after executing a Glory Kill - those gory finishers you can trigger after sufficiently damaging an enemy - another that allows me to snap to Glory Kill target from further away, and one more that slows down time if I hold alt fire in mid-air. These three runes let me dictate the flow. \n\nIf I\u2019m under assault, I can zoom-snap to a damaged target to take advantage of the invincibility frames of a Glory Kill more easily - as ever, these kills provide you with health that spills from your enemy\u2019s mutilated body. Once I\u2019ve done that, my movement speed doubles for a few seconds, allowing me to create some distance - fair warning, this game is fast anyway and this makes it feel like you\u2019re controlling a Bugatti.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b18df10-bdae-4fbb-93ad-79ee1c030300": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b18df10-bdae-4fbb-93ad-79ee1c030300", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "4674ae99-0ba4-4673-84c5-d32505cd989f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ec7cc6841849195fd5aef55e24934576056379bca9e727cad55359209033409"}, "3": {"node_id": "8577bcd7-42d4-4a90-af30-1a3e085283b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "14b774453e45696f0544a86d068314bd30d4cd183bc0fd7148ef02d7ec45f3fe"}}, "hash": "4ebd0baf5d7926be3943a4ef74e326ac1c14591553544eb9eb8e78d1459d549b", "text": "When the speed throws off my aim, I can run into a bounce pad, fly into the air, hold alt fire, and rain down a missile barrage in bullet-time. The ability to control the pace adds a lot, giving you the space to put on the brakes and assess the situation on the fly: which demons to prioritise, where to aim, what weapon to use, and where to head to keep yourself out of the firing line without getting boxed in. It\u2019s astounding how many different enemies there are, and how various combinations of enemy types change the feel of each encounter. Whenever you see a cacodemon flying nearby, your first instinct is to deal with it quickly. If they get close, they can corner you and tear at you with vicious bites. A single grenade in the mouth - either from your shotgun alt fire or your shoulder-mounted launcher - will prep them for a Glory Kill, but you might forget the other demons all around you as you adjust your aim to the skies. Fortunately, the new tool attached to the super shotgun, the meat hook, lets you take the aerial advantage yourself by grappling and pulling yourself towards an enemy. You can combine that with the aforementioned rune to slow time to a crawl, creating heroic moments where you take to the skies, time slows, you land a meaty headshot, and things instantly go back to seat-of-your pants mayhem as you land. The core gunplay of Doom has never felt as good as this. The new demon degradation system adds heft to each shot, with every bullet searing the flesh from your foes. Now we\u2019re ripping and tearing, and not just when we\u2019re splitting a demon in half with our hands. I also can not understate how satisfying the new sound effect is for exploding heads, like a kid popping their cheek with their finger. Pop! The sound design marries the gunfeel to extraordinary effect here, and this is backed by Mick Gordon\u2019s ear-pounding soundtrack, now with added heavy metal choir. It all combines to put you in the zone, an all-encompassing experience that\u2019s best enjoyed with headphones. Like those cacodemon gobs, each enemy has a weak point and you can reduce their effectiveness by taking advantage of these achilles tendons. Hop over a charging pinky, spin around and shoot its tail. Blast the guns straight off a cyber mancubus, or wade in with a Blood Punch, smack one, and strip its armour in one move. Snipe the turret from an arachnotron. Fire the plasma rifle to explode energy shields, damaging any dumb demon stood nearby. There\u2019s a tool and tactic for each enemy type, as there was in Doom 2016, but now there\u2019s more nuance to it - you have to switch your brain so you\u2019re calculating kills like a murderous supercomputer. Even other new tweaks like the flame belch - a short burst of fire from a shoulder-mounted weapon - adds a layer to encounters. Set a group of enemies aflame and every bit of damage you do will make them bleed armour shards, topping you up. Glory Kills for health, flame belch for armour, and your chainsaw is right there to cut demons open for ammo. A new melee weapon called the Crucible Blade unlocks later on, giving you the chance to insta-kill most enemies, though it has limited uses and needs constantly topping up. The BFG also makes a return, though it\u2019s now on the radial weapon menu rather than being this devastating smart bomb with its own dedicated panic button. This works fine for the most part, though the fact you auto switch to your last used weapon when you run out of ammo does occasionally lead to you accidentally firing it and wasting this rare resource. As well as expanding your arsenal, id Software has opened up the levels in Doom Eternal. Doom 2016 was criticised at launch for its predictable structure, where players moved from corridor to arena, corridor to arena. Here the arenas feel more organic, like part of an environment. They\u2019re more open, more layered, and there are more routes through them and more environmental hazards to take into account. They are large enough and with enough routes through to feel boundless, yet still flowing. These spaces have edges, of course, but they fit into the environment in more natural ways. Portals, swing bars, and bounce pads make for interesting routes through them. And sometimes the game offsets those large arenas by spawning in a demon in close quarters, forcing you to adapt and think fast before the situation gets away from you. There\u2019s much more visual variety here as well.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8577bcd7-42d4-4a90-af30-1a3e085283b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8577bcd7-42d4-4a90-af30-1a3e085283b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b18df10-bdae-4fbb-93ad-79ee1c030300", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ebd0baf5d7926be3943a4ef74e326ac1c14591553544eb9eb8e78d1459d549b"}, "3": {"node_id": "d1dbc4eb-9f4d-4ea7-b30e-357586f9215c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e380d99c9a312e22a69c8da728c0770d5f103ed309c34e4538045b5ff0f4e539"}}, "hash": "14b774453e45696f0544a86d068314bd30d4cd183bc0fd7148ef02d7ec45f3fe", "text": "There\u2019s much more visual variety here as well. You\u2019ll walk across the weapons of long-dead titans, and into the chest cavity of a murdered giant. You\u2019ll traverse lakes of molten lava, ascend to the heavens, look out into space, and see Hell on Earth both from ruined cities and the Arctic - literally Hell frozen over. Interiors are extravagant and interconnected, packed with fine details: statues with gold inlays, reflective materials shimmering in the light, elaborate door mechanisms, and mechanical contraptions snapping and whirring into place. It\u2019s a visual step up, a Doom with a view. The story that plays out across this journey is also stronger. It lays it on thick with optional lore, there are many more cutscenes, and it gets across more of Doom Slayer\u2019s character, tying modern Doom to its past and creating an expanded Doomiverse. You\u2019ll travel to places with names like \u201cTerrordome\u201d, \u201cSuper Gore Nest\u201d, and \u201cSlimy Gut Land\u201d - one of those is made up and I\u2019ll let you decide which. You\u2019ll solve puzzles, you\u2019ll fight, you\u2019ll jump, and - in the most misguided development decision I\u2019ve seen in a while - you\u2019ll swim. Let me get this out of the way: Doom Eternal does not need swimming sections. They are easily the low point of the entire game. They\u2019re mercifully short and sparingly used, but swimming is clunky and annoying. There\u2019s also points where you have to swim inside radiation where you can only survive for about ten seconds while wearing a rad suit. It\u2019s not rad at all. It\u2019s a word that rhymes with rad (it\u2019s bad, to be clear). I also want to put the new tentacle enemies that pop out of holes in the ground on blast - they aren\u2019t challenging, they\u2019re just irritating. The platforming doesn\u2019t get quite as much in the way as I feared, though there\u2019s a fair bit of it. It helps to break up the action, but sometimes the richness of the environments makes it difficult to gauge where you\u2019re meant to jump to, and the ability to double dash in the air means you often judge distances through trial and error. You don\u2019t die when you fall, thank Satan, but there are some platforming sections towards the end of the game that might test your patience. It all goes a bit \u201cit\u2019s-a me, Doomio\u201d. Other than that, I ran into a few minor bugs, like in one arena where the enemies would infinitely spawn until I reloaded a checkpoint (and this wasn\u2019t because of a Buff Totem, which is a new addition that spawns enemies until destroyed, or an Archvile, which is functionally the same). I also got stuck inside some geometry once, and the final boss got locked into an animation so I couldn\u2019t finish him off without reloading. That\u2019s all I had over my 15 hours of playtime, however - Doom Eternal is buttery smooth, slick, and polished for the most part. Even loading screens are nippy. When you\u2019re right in the thick of it, zipping around like a toddler after a pack of Smarties, efficiently and methodically laying waste to the hordes of hell at 900 gibs per minute, this is the strongest Doom has ever been. It\u2019s the combat of Doom 2016 expanded in clever ways, built upon in layers, like the skin and muscles of a demon that you remove in chunks with each trigger pull. Playing it is like catharsis, a virtual wall punch for the modern age. Version tested: PS4 Pro - a review copy was provided by Bethesda.

Doom 3, the long silence that followed, and the ill-fated Doom 4 are striking examples of the series being damned by its own past achievements. But the Doom Slayer kills damned things for a living and eviscerated that slump with the spectacular 2016 reboot; a surprising accomplishment that puts DOOM ETERNAL in the same hellish hot seat that has doomed others before it. Although instead of burning to ash in that hot seat, Eternal rips and tears it wide open, resulting in a more varied and streamlined version of the one the best first-person shooters ever created.Doom\u00a0(2016) was such a landmark shooter for many reasons but mostly because of its gameplay. Adapting the 1993 mindset of the debut, the reboot was remarkably fast and pushed you to use your trigger finger and brain to kill and refill your dwindling resources as quickly as possible. The breakneck pacing (buoyed by the high and stable frame rate) meant that every fight had an improvisational feel to it since you weren\u2019t afforded the time to sit back and strategize; your approach had to be decided as you were mere inches from the nearest horned hellspawn. It was like jazz, but with slightly more murder.Despite the Doom Slayer\u2019s penchant for dismemberment, Eternal has left that beating heart of the franchise intact. Chaining shotgun blasts and guided rocket barrages while ensuring to frequently Glory Kill and rev the chainsaw to refill your resources is still the rush it was back in 2016. No other game has even come close to matching the near-perfect nexus of speed and strategy that this formula naturally has and, given the dearth of meaningful competition, is still an utter blast to perform every time.But without expanding upon that, Doom Eternal would be a poor sequel and instead of merely using a bigger scale as a cheap marketing bullet point, the game uses its newfound additions to improve almost everything.

And the Blood Punch, once charged, turns your melee into a shockwave that is handy for instantly slaughtering groups of fodder and staggering bigger demons.ALSO:\u00a0Doom Eternal and Animal Crossing fans share the strangest friendship on the internetDoom\u2019s chess-like combat encounters are exponentially better when there are more pieces at play, especially when those pieces have distinct gameplay benefits. Choosing when to use what ability is just another quick decision you have to make that yields even more depth as you have to constantly remember what you have loaded and what\u2019s on cooldown in the heat of the moment. The weapons also play a big role in this as the array of primary and secondary fires are more toys that feed both the bloodthirsty and analytical sides of your brain.Eternal intelligently forces you to use every part of your loadout, too, as none of your many tools has much ammo. Ostensibly, by slightly starving you of resources, you\u2019re required to constantly hunt for what you need and switch up your playstyle in the process. It\u2019s an ingenious way for the mechanics push the player to play the game at its best: laying waste to every demon while also not wasting any part of its arsenal.Doom\u00a0(2016) only wasted one part of its arsenal: the crouch button. Id has replaced it with a dash that, when combined with the new monkey bars and the grappling hook on the Super Shotgun, make the already mobile Doom Slayer considerably more mobile. Cranking up the speed to 12 is more thrilling and demonstrates how Doom is better the faster it is played. While just an illusion founded upon Eternal\u2019s higher speed, it almost makes the 2016 reboot seem slow. Almost.All of these mobility and weapon upgrades are also evenly spread over the game\u2019s runtime. Carefully doling out these new toys repeatedly gives you something else to master and once you\u2019ve grasped one ability or weapon, another is dropped in your lap or hidden behind a secret cracked wall. Masterful pacing ensures that you start as a badass and only get continually more badass until the final encounter, which is an engaging approach more games ought to steal.The enemies and level design put the Doom Slayer\u2019s enhanced armory to the test and bring out its best parts. Eternal has a much larger array of demons and every one has a certain style and level of danger. Prioritizing threats and what instrument fits the job is Doom at its very core and having a bigger pool to pull from allows for an endless supply of fresh encounters.It never comes close to exhausting all of the possible permutations, something the remixed Master Levels (more of which are coming soon) effortlessly showcase. Eternal\u2019s constantly growing lineup of monsters allows for some devilishly devious combinations, but that\u2019s one of the game\u2019s most outstanding assets. Through its various weapons, upgrades, abilities, and enemies, the game is designed in a way to never stagnate as there is always some way to rearrange its multitude of variables and create an original encounter.Environments contribute to this ever-cycling sense of originality and are the unspoken hero in and outside of combat. Stages have more intricate geography with interesting setups outside of the combat arenas. Climbable walls and the aerial dash make platforming more involving and are simple yet effective ways to break up each demonic skirmish. Nothing can top the shooting \u2014 and the other parts don\u2019t try to \u2014 but it cleverly uses the mobility that\u2019s integral to the shooting to make the other parts of the game even better.But it also looks different as Eternal shifts Doom away from the franchise\u2019s safe places \u2014 Hell and Mars \u2014 and goes in some bold new directions. Mars and Hell are only sparingly done, but each have better, more involved vistas than any other entry in the series. It even goes outside of the normal red and orange hues, relying on bright purples, yellows, and greens that look like if Hell\u00a0 vomited on an open cadaver after downing six bags of Skittles. The Cronenbergian, fleshy Hell and Earth fusions are still the haunting highlights, even if a small handful of the normal buildings within them are drab by comparison. While not bland or attratively grotesque, the other angelic and icy environments are striking in other ways and illustrate how solid art direction can successfully guide a game out of its comfort zone.Doom Eternal, through its hardcore art design and kinetic combat loop, is extremely metal and its soundtrack is the aural linchpin that ties it all together.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b8ca73c-0f48-4f1c-9121-6d6b1895e872": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b8ca73c-0f48-4f1c-9121-6d6b1895e872", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "65a57712-7a2d-4ab3-8173-9349b2a36f4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "23985fea94f5291fd9be6cec35192b3ad45e7da4a360b4fcb6e44a77673a5668"}, "3": {"node_id": "4665e3ed-711e-4b22-bcbe-d802fa34ba20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db10beaf4faa3a0f932aa478eda74c50cccf6599e1db8aef5729312b41875171"}}, "hash": "d4858fa62f56c15e6234fca7574b9e651c8bd9fad39054b1f4082a1b32077dbb", "text": "Ambient tunes bubble with intensity, filling in the quieter respites, but then explode as Satan\u2019s forces materialize and is the audio adrenaline that perfectly pairs with the onscreen carnage. Few games have such an intimate connection to their music, which stands incredibly well by itself, but is infinitely better in the game; a feat few titles in the medium can claim.Given all the banging metal and big fuckin\u2019 guns, Doom Eternal sounds like it would have the narrative depth of the first five minutes of a porno. Instead, it tells an unobtrusive tale that doesn\u2019t impede the gameplay and rewards those who pay attention. Scenes are brief and effective at conveying the necessary information while also pointing more lore-hungry players to the optional codex.Be it the journal, the cutscenes, or both, the game efficiently expresses the unexpectedly poignant themes of its plot along with the backstory of its world and protagonist. While other aspects like the soundtrack, weapons, and Easter eggs pay homage to past entries, its narrative might hold the most respect for its history without going overboard. It may lack a bit of the charming nonchalance of the reboot, but it\u2019s still an effective example of economical, restrained action game storytelling.Doom Eternal has a lot in common with Doom 2. Both could never dream of matching the surprise or legacy of their immediate predecessor, but they each confidently expand on the historic foundations those games set. Using fast-paced first-person shooting as the framework, each sequel has wildly improved level design, a wider selection of demons to massacre, and a larger arsenal that come together to refine its core identity in the smartest, most respectful ways possible. However,\u00a0Eternal\u00a0is more ambitious than its 1994 counterpart, pushing even further and creating one of the best first-person shooters ever made in the process. The Doom Slayer has faced many nightmarish opponents and toppled them all, yet his greatest victory might be slaying the impossibly high expectations set by his genre-defining precursors.We\u2019ve now gotten to extensively play Battlemode and while it doesn\u2019t change the score, here are our thoughts.While Doom Eternal\u2019s campaign is an experience that can stand on its own, it doesn\u2019t have to. Battlemode, instead of a functional but dry assortment of deathmatch modes, pits two player-controlled demons against one juiced up Slayer. It isn\u2019t just a throwaway mode like the reboot either, as it meaningfully adds to the game despite its occasional hiccups.Like Modern Warfare\u2019s Gun Fight, it\u2019s a more intimate affair that automatically dials up the action because there are fewer people to absorb the pressure. And given that it directly borrows so many of the mechanics from the campaign, it\u2019s already filled with an excess of adrenaline. Playing as the Slayer is empowering because you can do almost everything an endgame Slayer can with most of the same upgrades, weapons, and abilities. Nothing gets lost in translation \u2014 a huge positive for a game with such strong solo mechanics \u2014 and using those single-players against real people is exhilarating.The demons are essentially all new but they\u2019re still a blast to control. Each hellspawn has its own style (that you can master in the effective tutorials) and using those unique powers in cooperation with your demonic partner to squeeze the Slayer strikes a different type of rhythm that is similarly as engaging. Demons can summon other A.I. demons, too, as well as create healing bubbles or hazardous zones, depending on what of the two variants you pick. Each of the three people also get to pick an upgrade after each match, further introducing more strategic options.It\u2019s simple yet still has plenty of depth, given all the possible ways to use your tools. Thanks to id\u2019s work on the core mechanics, the micro gameplay loops are sound so it doesn\u2019t need to lean heavily on upgrades or an array of loadouts. It just uses them to augment some of the best first-person shooting out there.Unlock systems can also help enhance any online game, but there aren\u2019t many of them here, at least natively. A sizable portion of the cosmetics are exclusive to different editions, the Slayers Club, pre-ordering, timed events, playing the other Doom games, or some other weird extracurricular marketing campaign. While it\u2019s fantastic that both halves of the game use the same skins and challenges, this leaves little in the actual game for regular people to unlock and thus a shorter metagame.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4665e3ed-711e-4b22-bcbe-d802fa34ba20": {"__data__": {"id_": "4665e3ed-711e-4b22-bcbe-d802fa34ba20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b8ca73c-0f48-4f1c-9121-6d6b1895e872", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d4858fa62f56c15e6234fca7574b9e651c8bd9fad39054b1f4082a1b32077dbb"}, "3": {"node_id": "11a1cf65-e753-4757-819b-2704c7834bf8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "56acf167adbb4db6a4f12be3f1a797f2b7e1705f8739fcdf12a3930c553e5f28"}}, "hash": "db10beaf4faa3a0f932aa478eda74c50cccf6599e1db8aef5729312b41875171", "text": "The sheer unique concept of the mode carries it quite far \u2014 not every game needs Call of Duty levels of experience bars and unlockables \u2014 but a few more cosmetics to chase in the actual game would have been ideal.Its abbreviated metagame hook isn\u2019t as much of a problem when compared to its bugs. The game will sometimes automatically empty all of your gadgets, blare the sound effects, not give you experience until well after a match, fail to put on the skin you chose, or lag without warning. Nothing damns Battlemode to the fiery underworld and many of these sound like something a patch or two could fix, but they stick out when the campaign is as sharp as they come. Still, both modes together make for one hell of a rewarding package that pay homage to the past while aggressively pushing into new territory.GameRevolution reviewed Doom Eternal on the PS4 with a copy provided by the publisher.10Michael Leri is Evolve's senior gaming editor.

It only took five minutes of playing it, tops, for people to realize that wasn\u2019t true, and that\u00a0Doom categorically ruled.Bethesda didn\u2019t make the same mistake with Doom Eternal.Doom Eternal\u00a0(PC, PS4 [reviewed on a PS4 Pro], Stadia, Switch, Xbox One)Developer: id SoftwarePublisher: Bethesda SoftworksRelease: March 20, 2020 / Switch (TBA)MSRP: $59.99I don\u2019t necessarily need a story in a Doom\u00a0game, but Eternal\u2018s got one.The approach is a bit different and wholly old-school: less \u201cuncovering a mystery\u201d and more \u201crip and tear,\u201d with the hellish motif front and center as Earth has already been subjugated by demons. There\u2019s plenty of lore to read and some cutscenes available if you want them, but Eternal\u00a0is very much content keeping action at the forefront. The gist is that you need to hunt down priests that have besieged Earth to save it, and hunt you will.Eternal\u2018s best beats involve the enhanced focus on the hero, the \u201cDoom Slayer,\u201d as well as the Slayer mythos as a whole and what makes him tick. His characterization of a badass that gets things done without being a stone-cold killer of men rules, as he never skirts the line of unlikability and radiates personality even if most of his dialogue consists of grunts. Beyond a very abrupt ending, the reductive narrative serves Eternal\u00a0well.Gameplay is also equally urgent. One of my favorite things about the new Doom reincarnation (Eternal\u00a0included) is how id Software once again nails the sense of speed. You get a double-jump immediately, you get double-dashing soon after, and it gets better from there. Eternal\u00a0brings back the idea of wielding a (limited-use) chainsaw to recover ammo and ripping apart weakened enemies with \u201cglory kills\u201d for health, but adds in two other wrinkles: the \u201cFlame [Thrower] Belch,\u201d which burns enemies in exchange for armor shards, and a super punch of sorts that refreshes after glory kills.This leads to a rapid-pace self-sustaining economy of power-ups, where you periodically chainsaw, burn, or glory kill to keep your run going. If you saw, torch, and rip apart things correctly, you\u2019ll always have a stream of health, armor, and ammo respectively without having to rely on pickups. It sounds confusing but it\u2019s more natural and intense in practice, especially when you\u2019re juggling a room full of varied enemies on a tougher difficulty setting. It\u2019s still so refreshing to not have to manually reload.Those enemies, mind, also have more of a strategic overarching design. They have more pronounced weakpoints that encourage you to surgically take out enemies in specific ways, like shooting the tail off of a Spiderdemon to thwart its long-range capabilities, or throwing a grenade into a\u00a0Cacodemon\u2019s mouth to instantly trigger a glory kill prompt.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11a1cf65-e753-4757-819b-2704c7834bf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "11a1cf65-e753-4757-819b-2704c7834bf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "4665e3ed-711e-4b22-bcbe-d802fa34ba20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db10beaf4faa3a0f932aa478eda74c50cccf6599e1db8aef5729312b41875171"}, "3": {"node_id": "49f56e0d-a1ad-4554-a136-78b0e0750993", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4a21790f246962c75fd08207b1ef3c542f246d1920408cf1b1f07daae68865e"}}, "hash": "56acf167adbb4db6a4f12be3f1a797f2b7e1705f8739fcdf12a3930c553e5f28", "text": "It feels really gamey at first, but once you\u2019re overwhelmed in a giant arena full of varied foes, trying to figure out the best way to approach each and every fight, it feels more justified. The only hiccup is when you annoyingly have to hunt down that one last\u00a0demon until a critical path door opens.During my tests, performance was great on a PS4 Pro, consistently rolling along at 60FPS, with 10-second-or-less load times. I encountered a few moments of stuttering during cutscenes (but rarely during gameplay), and one stuck checkpoint that I needed to reload to trigger. That\u2019s it. Everything is communicated on the HUD and accessibility options are available, including HUD alterations, even on consoles. When you add in more customization for the Slayer (like out-there rune passive abilities, returning weapon mods, and stat-increasing level-ups), it gets even more engaging.Once again maps feel acutely designed to provide a great deal of exploration while remaining pointed. Environments have a looser aesthetic, ripped free of the shackles of the mostly Mars/Hellscape motifs of Doom\u00a02016: we\u2019re galaxy-hopping now. Individual maps beg to be explored with the \u201cfast travel\u201d mechanic (which sounds stupid in a Doom\u00a0game at first) that lets players jump to different points of a map right before its finale. In other words, it\u2019s a way to grab stuff you missed before you leave and have to restart the entire level over.Despite the hardcore-looking veneer, things are loosened up a bit in general. You can swap difficulty settings at any time without penalty (with the exception of the permadeath settings, which are essentially different modes). Cheat codes are also available and do not disable progression. The game gets weird with select moments where you possess a drone of a demon and wreak havoc, and the campaign is still mission-based, as it traditionally has been since the start.\u00a0A Fortress of Doom hub (which I call the \u201cDoom Room\u201d) allows for a bit of respite and a way to store your collectibles between missions, like a fun interactive \u201cnext mission\u201d menu. It\u2019s kind of like Mortal Kombat\u2018s Krypt but without the microtransaction baggage. You can of course go back into any completed mission for a 100% clear, and periodic \u201cMaster Levels\u201d are available, which are remixed, tougher stages that give hardcore players a reason to run through them a third time. For disclosure, we did not have access to the multiplayer-centric \u201cBattlemode\u201d for this review outside of the brief tutorials, and as such it covers the single-player campaign.Doom Eternal\u00a0keeps the strong foundation built back in 2016 intact, while adding some of its own panache in the process. I think we can officially declare that the last iteration wasn\u2019t just a lone fluke, and that Doom\u00a0is back in the shooter spotlight where it belongs.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher, covering the single-player portion of the game.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back.

Login NowDoom Eternal ups the ante from Doom 2016 by adding platforming, new mechanics, and new gadgets. But is this sequel a worthy successor to the throne? Our review.Doom Eternal is by far one of the most anticipated games of the year. Following id Software\u2019s huge success with Doom 2016, many old and new fans alike are looking forward to diving into the Doom Slayer\u2019s next chapter. There\u2019s a lot to digest with the latest entry in the series \u2013 from new mechanics and weapons to the return of some iconic demon classes \u2013 and Doom Eternal is one hell of a good time.Editors note: This review only covers the singleplayer campaign. We'll have an official piece on the Battlemode multiplayer soon.Doom Eternal wastes no time thrusting players back into the action. The world is on fire \u2013 quite literally \u2013 and demons are piling in from Hell. The earth\u2019s population is falling drastically and it\u2019s clear that there is only one man who can stop it all from happening. Enter the Doom Slayer with a flourish of the series\u2019 iconic heavy metal music. There\u2019s no extended build-up here. No slow-motion entry point like we had in Doom 2016. Gone are the days of the pistol; Long live the Combat Shotgun.This is one of the first big changes players will recognize between Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal. The infinite ammo pistol, which could come in handy during those dry spells when ammo was a bit tough to find, is gone. The Combat Shotgun is your basic weapon this time around, and you\u2019ll find yourself coming back to it again and again throughout your playthrough.Other weapons unlock at standard progression points, with the Assault Rifle, Plasma Rifle, and even the BFG-9000 joining your arsenal as you make your way through the campaign. As always, you\u2019ll find yourself equipped with more than enough to take down the demons in your way. Unlike previous Doom games, which allowed you to pick and choose your weapons a bit more, ammo does get a bit scarce at times in Doom Eternal, forcing you to move through your weapon wheel in ways you might not have before. Enemies now feature defined weakspots, which when utilized can completely turn the tide of battle in your favor.As someone who enjoys using the Combat Shotgun, and the explosive rounds that come with it, I often found myself having to move through the other weapons that I had available to me, as ammo can get pretty tough to find during intense fights. Still, the new platforming abilities, and the new dash mechanic made for a nice change of pace, giving you new avenues to get away from danger quickly if you found yourself struggling to stay alive.As far as FPS games go, Doom has one of the richest histories, with over 25 years across the series. Despite the success of Doom 2016, id Software needed to follow it up with something even bigger. To do this, new mechanics and even new enemies were added to the lineup to help freshen things up and throw some wrenches into the well-oiled cogs that made Doom 2016\u2019s gameplay feel so good.The game still feels great with the new mechanics. Platforming works out well for the most part and adds some nice touches to combat \u2013 allowing you to swoop away using well-placed bars around the various combat arenas. These new mechanics also open up new areas of exploration, allowing you to move up and through levels much more efficiently. Unfortunately, Doom Eternal falls into the very pitfalls that most linear shooters do, where players are forced to learn to play the game the way that the developers intended.This isn\u2019t a game that allows you to pick and choose where you want to go or how you want to approach situations. You are a murdering machine, armed to the teeth with weaponry, and you\u2019re going to have to make use of it if you want to stay alive.Platforming isn\u2019t the only new device you have at your disposal, though. The Meat Hook \u2013 which is attached to the Super Shotty \u2013 allows you to grapple onto enemies, pulling you directly to them. This is handy during some fights, however I found it pretty useless the majority of the playthrough, as I was much more efficient at disposing demon hordes while moving around constantly. Of course, players more well-versed in the dance of Doom might find more use out of it in their own playthroughs.The Flame Belch also adds a nice dynamic, allowing you to light enemies on fire as you battle around them. This creates little chunks of armor that fall off of them, allowing you to add some additional defense to your dance of death.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6850490c-0fdc-4305-9271-24e6f23e8ac8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6850490c-0fdc-4305-9271-24e6f23e8ac8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "49f56e0d-a1ad-4554-a136-78b0e0750993", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c4a21790f246962c75fd08207b1ef3c542f246d1920408cf1b1f07daae68865e"}, "3": {"node_id": "c557e59b-efdc-40a2-a972-d466054071b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1984d504fdb5ea8ced2a52d681bb151dafa7b7d6fc3c021d720fb175a8d8091"}}, "hash": "a251d11fc0971b7f7bebd351676f1791900afff57260d7e302069f249db62dea", "text": "I will admit that I wasn\u2019t very good about making the most of this new device, but it did come in handy during tough fights with lots of enemies.Doom Eternal does a really good job of building off of the god-like view that has come to surround the Doom Slayer throughout the series. In fact, as you explore the world, you\u2019ll find various audio logs and broadcasts that seem to correlate with this thought \u2013 that the Doom Slayer is some holy avenger sent to protect humanity. It\u2019s a novel idea that works well, and as you dive deeper into the narrative that id Software has woven here, it all really comes together.I won\u2019t spoil the exact nature of the narrative, as it\u2019s something best experienced by Doom fans, but I was happy with the way that id Software brought everything between Doom Eternal and Doom 2016 together into a cohesive story. If you enjoyed digging deeper into the story behind the violence in the reboot of the series, then you\u2019ll probably really enjoy the narrative direction that Eternal has taken.What makes Doom so special for me, is the game\u2019s ability to just make you feel like an absolute badass. While other games have tried to capture that same feeling, none have ever done it as well as id Software has with Doom. Unfortunately, there are a couple of points in Doom Eternal where this feeling is ripped from you. In fact, one of the later boss fights of the game takes away that feeling entirely, as you\u2019re left to scrounge around the map for ammo drops, all while dealing with enemies that take multiple shots to kill. It\u2019s a huge takeaway from the mainstay of the series, and it made the entire fight feel like a chore instead of a challenge.Aside from that particular boss fight, though, the game does a very good job of making you feel like a force to be reckoned with. It\u2019s a feeling that still feels great despite the 4 years that have passed since Doom 2016 revived the series.It\u2019s very clear playing through Doom Eternal that the developers have designed it to be replayed again and again. While the normal battle encounters won\u2019t change, the way that the levels are designed opens up a load of exploration once you\u2019ve become more accustomed to the different mechanics.Slayer Gates and other secrets are littered throughout the world. These secrets include everything from Extra Lives to Cheat Codes that can be activated in Mission Select. There\u2019s also the new Fast Travel function, which unlocks at the end of a level, allowing you to teleport back to key areas of the level to explore more. This all helps to encourage exploration and replaying of levels. If you were a fan of 2016's classic Doom levels, then you'll be disappointed to learn that I didn't come across any during my time with the game. They might be out there somewhere, but at the time of this writing I haven't come across any. All around, though, the exploration options in Doom Eternal are much greater than in 2016, with much larger levels and areas just waiting to be found.Furthermore, the game has taken a heavy approach to challenges. Not only will you find the level-wide challenges for weapon points, but you\u2019ll also find weekly challenges that all count towards an overall season experience level. It's unclear how the developers plan to extend the content beyond this first season, but it does at least leave a road for Doom Eternal to grow much larger after release. The game also features a slew of skins that you can unlock to change how the Doom Slayer looks in the singleplayer and multiplayer modes, so if you're someone who enjoys loads of visual variation, you'll find plenty on tap in Doom Eternal.While Doom Eternal does a good job of building off of 2016\u2019s success, the game isn\u2019t without its missteps. The lack of any form of deathmatch feels weird \u2013 especially when you consider the part that the Doom series played in the birth of the game mode. The lack of any form of Battlemode access during the review process is also somewhat troubling, but we\u2019ll have more on that particular mode after it becomes available at the game\u2019s launch.As a whole, Doom Eternal is a solid game, and a great sequel. Unfortunately, it never goes beyond the scope that Doom 2016 set. While there are new mechanics and weapons, it just doesn\u2019t offer that same sense of freshness that the reboot did. Platforming \u2013 while a strong addition to many parts of the game\u2019s exploration \u2013 often feels heavy handed and forced.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c557e59b-efdc-40a2-a972-d466054071b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c557e59b-efdc-40a2-a972-d466054071b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f056566-89fc-4461-9fc7-061cd415f668", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e5874c06c18abff6485315afac4b58378e3bce184ed836dab68d0ba643f3219"}, "2": {"node_id": "6850490c-0fdc-4305-9271-24e6f23e8ac8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a251d11fc0971b7f7bebd351676f1791900afff57260d7e302069f249db62dea"}, "3": {"node_id": "25f0010f-6457-4764-9871-98493f0e0d3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94701417f7b49cf73143eacfa2a8987737a62d35b79949ae46e484c180bf14aa"}}, "hash": "b1984d504fdb5ea8ced2a52d681bb151dafa7b7d6fc3c021d720fb175a8d8091", "text": "Some encounters require you to time dashes and jumps together.Sure, I appreciated the puzzle-like nature of some of these instances, but others left me slowly losing armor or health as I plummeted to my death because it wasn\u2019t very clear which direction the developers wanted me to go. I often found myself wondering \u2018can I make that jump?\u2019 only to discover that I couldn\u2019t because it wasn\u2019t how I was intended to proceed.It\u2019s very clear from playing through the entirety of the campaign that id Software has designed every encounter with a \u201cright way\u201d to play it, and going outside of the lines that have been drawn will cost you \u2013 whether it costs you a death, or just some health and armor, is all dependent on how quickly you learn to pull your crayon back inside the lines where it belongs.This review is based upon a PC review copy of Doom Eternal provided by the publisher.

Doom to me has multiple paths and its up to you how you get to point a to point b.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHow can a game built on keys to access parts of the map and backtracking be considered multiple paths?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI don't know, I'm going on what reviewers are saying compared to Doom 2016.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYou said doom to you is about multiple paths, which makes no sense if you have ever played any of the doom games. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaybe he got his copy of Doom mixxed up with his copy of World of Warcraft.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYeah even if you compare Far Cry to Doom3 one was extremely linear and one was the more open world game.  Never really considered Doom to be about freedom of choice on objectives.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClassic Doom (and 2016) had a critical path through the level. Get red key, open red door, get blue key, open blue door, exit.\r It also had copious optional content that was not on the critical path. D2M1 had a chainsaw, a rocket launcher, a shotgun, a pile of health globes, some armor and 2 combat encounters that were only available if you went off the critical path, and that map was TINY.\r So I guess it's not about having multiple paths, but about having the option to explore off the critical path that people are worried about. For what it's worth, the 2 reviews I read or watched mentioned that exploring for secrets is still in the game, and that doesn't sound remarkably different from what we had in previous Doom games.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThats what I what.

It just fits. My problem was that the developers have created this flow for combat and if you don't follow it, you're penalized. I felt that Doom 2016 allowed me to experiment more, where as Eternal was very much \"this is how you kill this. Do it this way or you'll run into issues\". Does that make more sense?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt does in that Hugo has stated it killed him when people weren\u2019t playing Doom right, like you said, and then would complain that they only needed the shotgun to beat the game.  From what I gathered, your complaint is exactly what they were aiming for, they WANT you to play the game the way they designed it, not cheat it (essentially).   \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnyway, I haven\u2019t played the game yet, you have.  I have no leg to stand on but am just going by what I heard from Hugo and what I understood of it.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOh yeah, for sure. It's what they wanted, and that's fine. I just preferred being able to play the way I wanted a bit more. The game is still great, just wasn't what I wanted from the experience. Might be exactly what others out there want (aside from the devs) and that's great. This is just one opinion out of many.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRight on \ud83d\udc4d I totally respect that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you like Doom and don't mind having to follow the flow a bit more than usual, then it's still a great game, and a great Doom game. But, if like me, you prefer being able to play 99% of the game using your favorite weapon, then you'll probably run into some issues.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe platforming stuff makes me question whether I should get it. I hate platforming. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWish they'd release it early. I bet they could.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe problem with day/date digital/physical releases is that the digital release isn't allowed to go out until street date per the contracts with physical retailers.  Not all retailers receive it early and have it stocked.  Some don't get it until the day before due to shipping and logistics issues.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAre there any physical retailers still open to sell it?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHey!  You're that guy that does that daily pandemic map thing!  Cool!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso, given the lock in at ho e for the next bit this will be one of the few times I pick up a new release game.

It was a small con that many of us on staff felt was worth mentioning.\r Encounters require timing. Right? how dare I be upset a game requires skill to be good at. I'm not. \r I'm upset that the developers got heavy handed with the platforming because \"it's a new mechanic and its cool make them use it\". That's how it felt to me. \r Did it still work out? Sure. But sometimes the jumps they wanted you to make required a wonky amount of timing to pull off, and sometimes jumps you thought you could make, couldn't be made at all.
