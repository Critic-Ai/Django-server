The game's surprisingly beefy script seemingly can't go a moment without poking fun at itself and video game foibles at large - everything from the level design's love of bobbing collectibles through optical drive loading times to how much cash developer Playtonic blew on the boss battles. Many of these in-jokes are distinctly contemporary - there are a couple of gags about crowdfunding that may not entirely amuse the project's Kickstarter backers - but the majority take aim at the golden age of early 3D platforming, before the first-person shooter became the console industry's flagship genre. The game's grand yet dinkily styled, themepark environments teem with retro parodies, all of whom express themselves in authentically inane, pre-CD-ROM gibberish. Among other dramatis personae, you'll tangle with a maniacal low-res arcade mascot who presides over clumps of coin-op mini-games, a stony goliath perched atop a series of ramps, like the Whomp King in Super Mario 64, and a jovial minecart who pines for the days when hurtling along a rail was a charming novelty rather than the hoariest of cliches. As is often the case with this kind of humour, the self-awareness is by turns infectious and grating - jokes about unskippable dialogue and quality assurance are only so funny when they occur in a game that does, in fact, feature the odd wodge of unskippable dialogue and a rather unwieldy camera. The aggressively ironic tone also betrays a certain insecurity about whether the type of game Yooka-Laylee aims to be still merits attention, a commitment to making light of the whole enterprise lest it prove surplus to requirements. After 15 or so hours with the game I can answer that yes, there's still call for a platformer of this hue today, but Playtonic's devotion to the classics does feel like more of a check than an advantage in places, and the execution is a little too uneven for comfort.As the title suggests, Yooka-Laylee is a Banjo-Kazooie reboot in all but name, crafted by Chris Sutherland, Steve Mayles, David Wise and other members of the original Banjo team to fill the void left by Rare's transition away from the franchise under Microsoft. In place of Banjo's bear-and-bird double act it gives us a bat riding a chameleon's head, on a quest to rescue a magic book from an insect arch-entrepreneur, Capital-B - a quest that sees you gathering up to 150 shimmering, grinning Pagies to access worlds sealed away in other magical tomes, dotted across your adversary's capacious factory-lair. If there are different species in play, there's plenty of cross-over between franchises in terms of each duo's abilities. Unlocked as you visit each world and push further into Capital-B's mansion, Yooka-Laylee's moveset is a generous if well-travelled one, extending from bread-and-butter basics like the double-jump and gliding to advanced tricks such as the ability to turn invisible or walk underwater by farting out a bubble of air. Yooka can also gobble down berries to spit grenades or snowballs among other projectiles - feats of markmanship that go hand in hand with simple door-and-switch puzzles or (more problematically) arcade shooting gallery sequences. Laylee will eventually learn to burp stunning sonar waves, generate a force shield or perform an area-of-effect blast, shattering glass and triggering certain switches in one of the game's worlds. Each move benefits from some quirky little animations - even now, I still smile at the sight of Laylee balancing precariously atop her curled-up accomplice as he somersaults up ramps, or Yooka covering his ears before the bat lets rip with one of her sonar attacks.While searching for those Pagies - most locked in cages, or handed out by each world's eccentric residents once you've solved a puzzle or two - you'll also hoover up Quills, over a thousand in all. These are spent on a subset of abilities, doled out by the game's ubiquitous shopkeeper Trowzer Snake, but their true value is how they guide you through the landscape, tracing paths up and around cartoon monoliths or through crops of over-sized mushrooms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f19f8550-304c-46d2-9fae-9dcc58a4acd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f19f8550-304c-46d2-9fae-9dcc58a4acd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "dbc27474-6717-465c-a2d8-fdd7a9375026", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ec682677d08cdf1e070861cf22140888fc4bfb604db27206c1a3d45014247e4"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d8ad2e4-7a8b-414a-9278-be90ac805bda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "34d4dde1ebbb4e3cbc13fd80ae5761f4f30e163b0178c72b6687165c52abb514"}}, "hash": "927780ad2b8daac91c62e5bafccba37f01775b769482db54c1c72347253d5aec", "text": "It's a far cry from today's open worlders, where collectible items suffuse the terrain indiscriminately rather than helping to articulate it to the player.The game's five book worlds - which must be expanded by spending Pagies before you can get at their choicest areas and treasures - are at once Yooka-Laylee's biggest draw and, in the end, greatest disappointment. The first is a gorgeous, breezy slab of pop Aztec architecture that reaches up from jungle gullies to drifting island-chains, a statement of intent that is always a pleasure to return to (not least for the discovery of what feels like a deft Dark Souls reference near the spawn). The last you'll encounter is also a gentle marvel, a cosmic marriage of Pirates of the Caribbean and The Jetsons, distinguished by wallowing asteroids and a golf course erected over a black hole. Those in between are a mixed bag, however, both overly beholden to stereotype and slightly scattershot in their activity and obstacle design. One of the game's larger problems is that there's rarely the sense, as in the best level-based platformers, that a realm has been constructed around unique concepts that are elegantly paid out as you make yourself the master of associated abilities. There are puzzles that are specific to each world, including the option to transform into various goofy vehicles care of an absent-minded octopus professor, but by and large, going from book to book is more a question of altering the mood than the mechanics. The inevitable ice-themed environment does feature a couple of vivid dungeon puzzles, amongst them a grotto that shifts to an isometric (or as the writing would have it, \"icymetric\") perspective, but is otherwise a palette-swap with some extra-slippery slopes. The subsequent casino-themed level does a few intriguing things with the ability to refract laser beams through Yooka while he's invisible, but boils down to clusters of fruit and pachinko machines that feel more like a break from the game than a meaningful continuation of it. Least appealing of all is the Halloween world, a dreary swamp's worth of floating logs, bulbous pipes and grappling points, with the odd glowering pumpkin thrown in at random. Regardless of their success as platforming playsets, each environment is worth visiting for its layered, throwback orchestral score, which ratchets up and eases off organically as you explore to vary the ambience.The handling has its ups and downs, too, generally fluctuating in quality by the move or puzzle. The game's camera is dependable enough when it comes to bouncing between platforms or gliding through hoops, but anything that actually requires a measure of precision - say, using Yooka's tongue to lasso a grapple point or a berry during a timer-based puzzle - can be a headache. The protagonists themselves are pretty responsive for the most part, but there are some notable wobbles. You'll eventually learn to fly, for example, which makes back-tracking across landscapes to scoop up far-flung Pagies a cinch, but saddles you with a large turning circle that often throws the camera into disarray. The game's alternate forms can also be a pain to steer, particularly the ice world's snow plough, though having to compensate for the extra inertia is admittedly the point of the puzzles in question.Hiccups of this sort don't cripple Yooka-Laylee, but they do scrape the shine off a project that is already a mite too comfortable with the glass ceiling its premise imposes, for all the flurries of fourth-wall-breaking humour. Criticising the game for being faithful to inspiration may seem churlish - Playtonic has never pretended to be doing anything other than reviving a beloved formula, warts and all. But it's hard not to look at some of the quirkier games the studio's founders were responsible for at Rare, including 2008's underrated Banjo & Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, and not feel like punches have been pulled. Still, as a whole Yooka-Laylee is more self-deprecating than it needs to be. This is a sumptuous, diverting homage to a bygone era in game design that should keep fans of the old school hooked, even if it doesn't set the world on fire.\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d8ad2e4-7a8b-414a-9278-be90ac805bda": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d8ad2e4-7a8b-414a-9278-be90ac805bda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "f19f8550-304c-46d2-9fae-9dcc58a4acd9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "927780ad2b8daac91c62e5bafccba37f01775b769482db54c1c72347253d5aec"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d1a07e8-564f-4815-998f-be526780e3fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a9b4d3f1436c981cb43c9c18908c6bf13a1fd8c3f10be8cc5cb793b6d67f614"}}, "hash": "34d4dde1ebbb4e3cbc13fd80ae5761f4f30e163b0178c72b6687165c52abb514", "text": "Find out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nEdwin Evans-Thirlwell\n\n          Contributor\n        Edwin is a writer from London hailed by peers as \"terminally middle-class\" and \"experienced\".

An old-school 3D platformer and spiritual successor to Banjo Kazooie.\nExpect to pay: $40/\u00a335\nDeveloper: Playtonic Games\nPublisher: Team17\nReviewed on: Windows 10, 8GB RAM, GeForce GTX 970\nMultiplayer: 2-4 player party minigames\nLink: Official siteThe hardest enemy I had to fight in Yooka-Laylee was its camera. The hordes of minions sent by evil corporate book-napper Capital B were easily killed and often ignored, but wrestling the third-person camera into submission was like trying to get an actual bat to ride on the head of an actual iguana. Guiding Yooka the iguana and Laylee the bat on a quest to collect magical Pagies and get their book back from Capital B brought both a welcoming sense of nostalgia along with all the familiar flaws of N64-era 3D platformers.\u00a0Yooka-Laylee is a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie made by much of the same team, and developer Playtonic Games has shamelessly copied from the Banjo playbook all throughout this revival. The game has the same cheeky dialogue and garbled character voices, the same collectibles to gather in each level, and pretty much the same exact moveset for your interspecies duo\u2014all with a fresh new skin stretched over the top. But Yooka-Laylee also brings back the same terrible camera and dull combat, and aspects of what made Banjo-Kazooie so revolutionary in 1998 don't necessarily hold up two decades later.One part that definitely did hold up, however, is the jump. As simple as it is, a platformer's jump can make or break the entire game. Here, Yooka-Laylee feels exactly right. Key components like high-jumping from a crouch or double-jumping into a glide feel natural and make walking around any of the game's five main worlds (plus a hub world connecting them all) smooth and satisfying. Missing jumps or falling off ledges, for the most part, felt like my fault\u2014which is a victory not to be understated.This may look like a staged screenshot, but it's actually just one of the horrible camera angles going uphill in a closed hallway can cause.By contrast, Yooka-Laylee's wider selection of movement systems rarely reach the same standard. There are unique transformations in each world, and most of them are a mess to control. The snowplow transformation on Glitterglaze Glacier nearly had me rage-quitting as I unpredictably drove off cliffs\u2014I slowly learned that the plow can't reverse, and pressing back actually moves you forward in a wide turn. A later move that let's Yooka grab onto Laylee's legs and fly for an extended period of time was nearly impossible to control accurately if I wasn't moving in a straight line, and glitched out visually if I went too high.These issues are exacerbated by the aforementioned very bad camera. It wasn't uncommon for the camera to pull in uncomfortably close (and usually aim straight down at the floor) anytime I got just a little too close to a wall or a corridor was a bit too tight, which is the sort of nostalgia I could have done without. If Playtonic is trying to perfectly recreate an N64 game, then the awful camera angles are certainly part of that legacy.Another example of a 90s holdover is Yooka-Laylee's lackluster combat. It's not terrible, it's just pointless. There are two main types of enemies you'll be fighting: a pair of bouncing eyeballs that attach themselves to nearby objects, and a generic minion that changes appearance in each world but only ever takes one hit to kill\u2014or two, if it's wearing a hat. I could literally walk past the vast majority of them, but occasionally a few would get in the way and become a chore to clean-up with a basic spin attack, respawning liberally to make my efforts even more pointless. No attempt has been made to make combat interesting, and Laylee even says as much in a moment toward the end of the game.Laylee says what I'm thinking so often it's sort of unsettling.But these legacy issues aren't the only problems. Yooka-Laylee's biggest failing comes in its level design: the five worlds feel hollow, lacking soul, despite some cute themes. Each is an open sandbox with a smattering of Pagie-rewarding challenges to complete or puzzles to solve.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "369ba706-8a0b-42c6-8d1e-7d0ee13886e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "369ba706-8a0b-42c6-8d1e-7d0ee13886e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d1a07e8-564f-4815-998f-be526780e3fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a9b4d3f1436c981cb43c9c18908c6bf13a1fd8c3f10be8cc5cb793b6d67f614"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8e10fb3-f060-4a3b-a84d-679385b92e55", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f70632b5c2c01ec70a7cd4dedc356c4d338b04af6f51eae296e944f324ebf9f0"}}, "hash": "4cddd9de878ae15868f53a46a62b7e1b1e7ad76be24e37e47b3e4cafc0818963", "text": "The game's Steam page refers to them as playgrounds, which I think is a better name than 'world,' because they don't feel fleshed out enough to be chunks of some real place.I rarely ever platformed to progress through a level, just to get my prize and move on to the next one. Yooka-Laylee also has a variety problem, often reusing tweaked versions of challenges and characters even if they have no relevance to the theme, ensuring the worlds don't have unique identities of their own. There are multiple giant golf courses, lots of inexplicably floating minecart courses, and so many mind-numbing, god-awful quiz segments that even Laylee got sick of that shit. I was sick of it after a single quiz. And none of the quirky characters you meet feel like they have a place in the world. They're just sprinkled around the map like Pagies\u2014you won't find Mumbo's Hut built as part of the landscape, for example.The Capital Cashino world arguably has the strongest voice of its own, taking place in a giant casino full of games and gambling. Instead of Pagies, you get tokens that you can turn in for Pagies, ten-for-one. I was hopeful entering Capital Cashino that it would be a more thoughtful level, but tokens were earned almost entirely through tiny and unsatisfying minigames like Pachinko and slot machines. There are at least half a dozen nearly identical slot machines scattered around the world, which felt more like filler than soul.The themes of the worlds are genuinely lovely, though, lush with detail and each one very different than the others. Yooka-Laylee is a beautiful looking game when played on its highest setting, and I love that the UI is hidden whenever it's not needed. The bright colors and varied environments really shine, and are supported by some fantastic character design, even if they don't fit into those worlds. The music from veteran Rare composers Grant Kirkhope and David Wise is some of the best I've heard in a long while, and may even outshine Banjo-Kazooie's at times.On the performance side, Yooka-Laylee ran at a solid 60 fps on my GTX 970 while at max settings. The options you can adjust are very limited, but thankfully I ran into essentially no performance issues while I played. While it's definitely meant to be played with a gamepad, it controls well enough with a mouse and keyboard if you prefer\u2014though the camera is even more unwieldy that way. A slight annoyance is that some button prompts will still be shown as 'A' and 'B' buttons no matter your control scheme.Yooka-Laylee looks and sounds like the modern 3D platformer the I've been dreaming of for a while. It's just that the actual things to do in each world don't feel quite as inspired. I really did like many of the jungle-gyms I was given to hop around, and some of Yooka-Laylee's more fun Pagies to earn were timed jumping courses which required real dexterity. But they were usually self-contained little loops that always ended where they began, meaning I rarely ever platformed to progress through a level, just to get my prize and move on to the next one. There's a lot of walking between things to do.The more I explored each of Yooka-Laylee's worlds, the more they felt like a first pass instead of a final product. They all reminded me of the Toybox demo world initially sent out to Kickstarter backers, with different features and challenges plopped around to easily show off rather than be part of some coherent fiction. I frequently found nooks and crannies in walls that could have held secrets, but instead were just the result of boundary geometry not quite meeting up properly. While the contents of these worlds felt refined, the worlds themselves were nothing more than shells, and I doubt I'll remember any of them fondly like I do Treasure Trove Cove from Banjo or Dire Dire Docks from Super Mario 64.\u00a0Yooka-Laylee is frustrating because it has genuine touches of greatness. It has a phenomenal soundtrack, cheeky and clever dialogue, and tight fundamental platforming that would stand tall amongst its inspirations. But all of that is muddled by soulless level design that's OK at its best and a swath of frustrating or repetitive extras. It took me 12 hours to beat the game, but that's without getting all 145 Pagies available.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8e10fb3-f060-4a3b-a84d-679385b92e55": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8e10fb3-f060-4a3b-a84d-679385b92e55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "369ba706-8a0b-42c6-8d1e-7d0ee13886e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4cddd9de878ae15868f53a46a62b7e1b1e7ad76be24e37e47b3e4cafc0818963"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2b15c06-fa83-4069-8a9b-8268751a2518", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b25b528a58b80689ce5963a1401ee21e9121e06cd9bd880ce165764d0143b3e7"}}, "hash": "f70632b5c2c01ec70a7cd4dedc356c4d338b04af6f51eae296e944f324ebf9f0", "text": "I could probably spend another 5-10 hours finishing off everything there is to do, but frankly Yooka-Laylee just didn't make me want to.Playtonic did a fine enough job of recreating the nostalgia of playing Banjo-Kazooie, but Yooka-Laylee simultaneously revives all the bad parts of those games while never quite living up to the good parts.

Find out more about our reviews policy.Immediate impressions of Yooka-Laylee are pretty damn great. From the very off, it nails the all-important character-feel inherent to the success of any 3D platformer. Our bat/lizard combo protagonist is instantly responsive, and movement is slick, swift, and eminently malleable \u2013 the product of well-judged character weight, momentum, and control-precision working in co-operative tandem. And jumping? Well jumping feels just lovely. The same goes for careening into hapless enemies with the harnessed frenzy of the pair\u2019s spin attack. Whizz. Bosh. Pop. It\u2019s as delightfully tactile as any character action in the game, both functional and fun to perform in its own right.As such, Yooka-Laylee seems to deliver exactly what we were hoping for. A modern game that recreates the sensibilities of its late-\u201890s inspirations in a thoroughly polished form that those Nintendo 64 originals simply could not. A game that delivers what our nostalgia-addled minds remember Banjo-Kazooie being, rather than the antiquated reality. In tandem with bold, detailed, characterful audio-visual design, Yooka-Laylee\u2019s first couple of hours feel every bit the platforming equivalent of 2016\u2019s Doom. A game that reaches back into the \u201890s, grabs the core essence of its original series, and yanks it through into the present, updating as it goes to create the sense of being dropped into a parallel universe where that style of game design never fell out of fashion.It doesn\u2019t last.The cracks first start to show, in a tragically fitting case of the wrong kind of period accuracy, with the consistently shonky camera.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2b15c06-fa83-4069-8a9b-8268751a2518": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2b15c06-fa83-4069-8a9b-8268751a2518", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8e10fb3-f060-4a3b-a84d-679385b92e55", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f70632b5c2c01ec70a7cd4dedc356c4d338b04af6f51eae296e944f324ebf9f0"}, "3": {"node_id": "70903e5a-fc3e-481e-a829-7f03b27778e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6bfa5aae8ebdb13f0438f18d174908a4532115b12b2046d1c46e13d277ab300"}}, "hash": "b25b528a58b80689ce5963a1401ee21e9121e06cd9bd880ce165764d0143b3e7", "text": "Long the bane of the genre, the creation of a consistently effective camera system \u2013 whether automated or under player control \u2013 certainly isn\u2019t an easy task given the ever-changing, omni-directional demands of platforming in a 3D world, but Yooka\u2019s feels at times almost willfully obstructive, prone to stubborn shifts in the wrong direction, particularly (but not exclusively) in tighter areas, and pretty regular, full-blown angle flips at entirely inopportune moments. Of course, stalwarts of the genre are used to wrestling with such problems, but that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that the camera here is a regular and frequent roadblock to actually playing the game, making some otherwise fun and innocuous challenges a chore, and weaker ones really not worth the effort to finish.As for those challenges, which make up the meat of the game, they\u2019re decidedly inconsistent. \u00a0Following the traditional template laid out by Banzo-Kazooie and main-series 3D Mario, Yooka-Laylee\u2019s core objective is the collection of Pagies, anthropomorphised book pages used to unlock new Worlds and expand currently open ones in order to access new, harder challenges, to a total of 25 in each. These require a wide variety of localised platforming, puzzling, and combination feats to attain which, while certainly capable of being fun and rewarding, are also diluted by some uninspired, forgettable, or simply dated design. Again, Yooka-Laylee\u2019s 1998 origins surface in the wrong way, and the cracks widen.For every breakneck sprint through a gratifying platform assault course, there\u2019s a bland, card-matching memory test or insta-fail, trial-and-error maze built of identical, looping architecture. For every precarious, carefully timed ascent of a hazardous mountain, there\u2019s another stale, repetitive, drastically overlong boss fight, or timed slide section, dull in layout but littered with over-numerous hazards of the cheapest variety.\u00a0And while later and expanded Worlds tend to become more involved, too many objectives rely on cheesily tight time limits and unnecessary punishments for slight errors, creating a blunt artificial difficulty based on luck, rather than building a nourishing, interesting one out of cleverly escalating design or intricacy. There\u2019s a definite feel of breadth over depth in Yooka-Laylee, the game\u2019s valiant focus on progressively unfolding and revealing its world coming at the expense of the activities within it. \u00a0With its Worlds also lacking a carefully crafted sense of flow and pace in their layouts \u2013 they\u2019re always beautiful, vibrant environments, but tend to feel like collections of randomly placed stuff rather than real, logical places, making navigation less intuitive than it could be \u2013 there\u2019s an increasing sense of the lightweight about the overall experience. And ironically, it\u2019s eventually compounded by the game\u2019s chosen means of expansion.In addition to its versatile core move-set, Yooka-Laylee furnishes an eclectic set of additional, persistent powers in exchange for Quills, its secondary, more numerous currency. Ranging from grappling hooks, to explosions, to Sonic-style spin-dashes, and ultimately to full-blown flight, these expanded abilities can mostly be purchased in any order, albeit with a couple of stages of progress-based unlocking occurring in the shop. But while they add a great deal of valuable re-exploration scope to the factory-based hub, by way of genuinely fun, Metroid-style backtracking and secret-scouring, their use in the main game Worlds leaves a fair bit to be desired.7 things I wish I knew before I started Yooka-LayleeThe failings of this ability-gating system ultimately come down to what feels like careless implementation, but the issue starts in Yooka-Laylee\u2019s overall approach to challenge design. In addition to the variable quality of its objectives, the game also has a problem with transparency, its visual cues and systemic signposts not always doing the best job of signifying approaches and solutions, in the more puzzle-based challenges at least. Although sometimes puzzling for the wrong reasons, this stuff can generally be worked out, even if by a brute force, try-everything strategy. But the problem comes when challenges require certain powers, particularly late-game ones.\u00a0Without flagging these requirements, or implying them through intuitive design, Yooka-Laylee seems happy to let the player fruitlessly attempt the impossible with no sign that the missing ingredient isn\u2019t a clever solution, but rather a special ability that they may not yet even know exists. At best, this is a poor and time-wasting consideration for the player experience.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70903e5a-fc3e-481e-a829-7f03b27778e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "70903e5a-fc3e-481e-a829-7f03b27778e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2b15c06-fa83-4069-8a9b-8268751a2518", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b25b528a58b80689ce5963a1401ee21e9121e06cd9bd880ce165764d0143b3e7"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f4fd555-e158-40b4-b27a-4964db4756bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0faecefc8842d48913ffca61922d901463406dbd64621d62b61641b55c482bc"}}, "hash": "e6bfa5aae8ebdb13f0438f18d174908a4532115b12b2046d1c46e13d277ab300", "text": "At best, this is a poor and time-wasting consideration for the player experience. At worst, it\u2019s an early boss-fight that\u2019s effectively impossible (but not obviously so), until you gain one of two late-game abilities, at which point the entire battle is vetoed and over in seconds.Coupled with a few distinctly abstract and oblique interpretations of abilities in its puzzle solutions, instances where the game\u2019s previous teachings dictate that certain powers should solve particular problems (but they don\u2019t), and even a World 5 puzzle that abruptly throws in the need for a new, hitherto nonexistent power-up (whose location is consistently masked by the camera\u2019s folly), Yooka-Laylee\u2019s admirable ambitions of a deep, evolving player journey are consistently hampered by confused and counterintuitive execution. That the final flight ability also entirely and immediately breaks a noticeable number of the traversal challenges encountered earlier in the game (and this is a nonlinear game, remember) just epitomises the often messy and careless implementation of the system.Even the goofy, self-aware personality of the game ultimately suffers from dated awkwardness. Playtonic steers pleasingly into knowing self-parody regarding Rare\u2019s old tropes - even including an enemy type that is literally a set of googly eyes in search of an object to possess - but the charm falls apart as soon as its characters open their mouths.\u00a0Flat dialogue, almost devoid of personality, is the default in Yooka-Laylee, a game seemingly desperate to prove how funny it is, but without any discernable personalities or jokes. Yooka himself is maddeningly bland, while Laylee\u2019s endless quest for a sassy edge simply results in her being one of the most witlessly unpleasant game heroes in a long time, seemingly unable to finish a conversation without dropping an unnecessary (and deeply unfunny) insult.\u00a0Yooka-Laylee is a frustrating game. And not just when the camera throws you off a cliff, or when your progress is stalled by another tedious, three-strikes-and-out trivia quiz, or when the belligerent checkpoint system respawns you on the opposite side of the map from your current challenge should you dare to die. It\u2019s frustrating because, when you look through the glitches, and the more ill-conceived objective designs, and the intermittent lack of clarity, there is the blueprint for a good game underneath. A bright, brash, breezy, robust and good-natured platformer that, while it might not equal the genre\u2019s greatest, certainly has a place in the conversation.\u00a0Unfortunately, by not so much updating 20 year-old design concepts as porting them wholesale into the present - naiveties and technical issues complete - Yooka-Laylee recreates its origins far too accurately. The best of Banjo-Kazooie is here, but so is the worst, with a few new problems to boot. And while a lot of this was much less of an issue in \u201998, in 2017 it just makes Yooka-Laylee a whole lot harder to like than you\u2019ll want to.\u00a0This game was reviewed on PlayStation 4.\u00a0The 32 greatest Samuel L.

And if you\u2019ve no idea what any of those things are you\u2019re likely to be pleasantly surprised, and only occasionally frustrated.UK developer Playtonic are staffed by a number of Rare veterans, particularly those involved with 1998\u2019s Banjo-Kazooie and its 2000 sequel (both of which are available as backwards-compatible Xbox 360 titles and in the Xbox One compilation Rare Replay). The games were Rare\u2019s take on Super Mario 64, and together with Nintendo\u2019s game not only moved the traditional platformer into three dimensions but experimented with what would today be recognised as open world hubs filled with sandbox style gameplay.As influential as they were such games don\u2019t really exist anymore, and playing Yooka-Laylee now is a slightly surreal experience because, apart from the legally required change in characters, it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect Banjo-Kazooie 3 to look and play like (Nuts & Bolts doesn\u2019t count). So just like the originals Kazooie Laylee the inexplicably rude bird bat sits on the shoulders of Banjo Yooka the personality-free bear chameleon. Except via some limited co-op options, the two control as one character \u2013 as they try to defeat the ill-defined plans of Gruntilda and Kungo Captial B and Dr Quack.If your only experience with 3D platformers is Ratchet & Clank or Super Mario Galaxy then Yooka-Laylee will surprise you in just how different a game it is. It requires much more technical skill than any of Insomniac\u2019s games, while its open world nature now seems closer to Zelda than Mario (in terms of the non-linearity, not size). That\u2019s all to the good, although it means just one small mistake can cost you long minutes of progress. Especially given Yooka-Laylee has no checkpoint system other than restarting you at whatever door you last walked through.If this was a normally funded game then we\u2019re sure Playtonic would\u2019ve looked at smoothing out some of the game\u2019s rough edges, but most of them are part and parcel of the retro aesthetic that fans were so desperate to see recreated. And that definitely includes the game\u2019s status as a collectathon, with a purposefully huge range of different items to collect \u2013 from simple tokens to increase the size of your power bar (used to fuel certain moves) to coins that grant you access to N64-esque mini-games, and many more besides.The two most important collectables though are musical notes quills and Jiggies Pagies. Quills are the currency used to buy new moves from Trowzer the snake (geddit?), which in another demonstration of the game\u2019s non-linearity can be bought in any order. Pagies are used to open up each of the five worlds, but they can also be spent on expanding already open ones. In the first world this simply increases its size to encompass new areas, but this can vary \u2013 with the ice world unlocking some isometric sections reminiscent of Ultimate Play the Games titles like Knight Lore.The worlds are filled with interesting and unique details like that, with the colourful visuals and intricate stage designs being one of the game\u2019s most impressive achievements. There\u2019s also a huge variety of different mini-games and extras, although some prove more entertaining than others. Like Banjo-Tooie, you get to transform into a different animal, plant, or vehicle in each world; while there are a lot of fun race challenges and five different \u2018Ghost Writers\u2019 to discover in each environment.The inevitable minecart sections are horribly frustrating though, and the combat and bosses generally uninteresting. That goes doubly so for the trivia quizzes that pop up, which seem to be positioned as a semi-ironic comment on how everyone hated them in the originals. Or at least we assumed it wasn\u2019t just us that didn\u2019t like them \u2013 now we\u2019re not so sure.The line between irony and blind nostalgia also blurs when it comes to the dialogue, which most of the time is painfully unfunny. We think it\u2019s sort of meant to be, although it gets confusing when there\u2019s a genuinely good joke (there\u2019s a particularly barbed one about modern standards of bug-testing) that makes you wish the whole game was like that. We don\u2019t care what anyone says about the gobbledegook voiceovers though, they were awful back in 1998 and only barely tolerated then as an obvious limitation of cartridge storage.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e9984a8-9ca6-4677-b5e7-cf1ef46fd72f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e9984a8-9ca6-4677-b5e7-cf1ef46fd72f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "1f4fd555-e158-40b4-b27a-4964db4756bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0faecefc8842d48913ffca61922d901463406dbd64621d62b61641b55c482bc"}, "3": {"node_id": "41cef8a6-0ecd-4fd8-86b8-96851db8e51e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "24e69c1714155f4ad0332bd4752aa1ed927ef08ad89c5045a3ce7c98a36503d8"}}, "hash": "57d16382c3108e8d707a07be61953874a13a49841cb1ec764634e78c29de6811", "text": "Listening to them now is like chalk on a blackboard.Speaking of QA, there are a number of technical issues in Yooka-Laylee, which while individually are of little consequence do add up to a more substantial complaint. The most obvious is the camera, which has a particular problem with enclosed spaces. It\u2019s better than most camera systems from the \u201890s but it\u2019s not up to modern standards, and even manages to frustrate with the over-the-shoulder view used for aiming projectiles. The frame rate can also be less than stable on a normal PlayStation 4, and we would assume the Xbox One, although it\u2019s mostly fine on a PS4 Pro.We have to say we also found the actual movement a little too frictionless for our liking, and had to turn the look sensitivity of the camera right down to get anywhere. Again, it\u2019s just the game trying to be like the old ones, and you quickly get used to it, but we found it all a little weightless and unsatisfying. We don\u2019t want to be too down on the game though, because as we said at the start this is clearly exactly what fans wanted. And although it doesn\u2019t advance the genre in any meaningful way it is filled with wonderful details, from the enemies that are just googly eyes, that then attach themselves to previously inanimate objects, to the glorious David Wise soundtrack.If that last sentence meant nothing to you then you might want to be a little cautious about what you\u2019re getting into with Yooka-Laylee. Nothing in the game is broken, and most of it is a lot of fun, but it\u2019s a backwards-looking game that is more concerned with recreating the past than forging the future. That\u2019s not the criticism it may sound like, but it does mean the game has to limit itself to being the ultimate nostalgia trip rather than the ultimate 3D platformer.In Short: It perfectly fulfils its brief of being a new Banjo-Kazooie game in all but name, but Yooka-Laylee\u2019s reliance on nostalgia may struggle to find new fans.Pros: The world and art design is gloriously \u201890s and the range of moves and abilities is very impressive. Non-linear progression and a near infinity of hidden secrets. Great music.Cons: The camera, and to a degree the movement system, are a little too retro. As are the awful voices and mostly awful jokes.

Over time, that scene dried up, with few successful franchises remaining outside of Nintendo's established stable. Yooka-Laylee is a callback to the heyday of the 3D platformer, but through modernization, polish, and a whole lot of creativity, it successfully demonstrates that the genre is far from dead.The setup is simple enough: The bad guy stole a magical book, and you need to retrieve it. That task falls upon the unlikely duo of Yooka, a bipedal chameleon, and Laylee, a small bat that rides on his back. Controlling these characters is easy, as the movement and platforming mechanics feel tight, whether you're jumping across platforms or spinning to take out enemies. The camera is solid most of the time, but has a tendency to get caught up on walls and pillars when the characters wind up in tight spaces.The hunt for the book takes Yooka and Laylee to five distinct worlds. From a standard ice region housing a labyrinthine castle to an absurd outer space-infused pirate world, seeing where you go next is always a cool surprise. Each location holds two primary collectibles: Pagies, which grant access to new levels or expand upon existing ones, and Quills, a form of currency used to buy new abilities.Quills are scattered everywhere, and are easy to snatch up. I liked trading them in to expand my arsenal of moves; some abilities earned late in the game even open new areas in previously explored worlds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41cef8a6-0ecd-4fd8-86b8-96851db8e51e": {"__data__": {"id_": "41cef8a6-0ecd-4fd8-86b8-96851db8e51e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e9984a8-9ca6-4677-b5e7-cf1ef46fd72f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "57d16382c3108e8d707a07be61953874a13a49841cb1ec764634e78c29de6811"}, "3": {"node_id": "29387b3c-5486-4fd1-98f9-1e847ac744f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1c53b6ef1f6822663badffbe8f37a82395e703e91c87cea0b914d96342607a2"}}, "hash": "24e69c1714155f4ad0332bd4752aa1ed927ef08ad89c5045a3ce7c98a36503d8", "text": "That realization is always exciting, but the ability pool dries up too soon, meaning unless you want to be a completionist who hunts for all 1,010 Quills, the collection mechanic serves no value in the late game.Pagies play a larger role in story progression, and thus require you to complete objectives to obtain them. The missions they are tied to vary wildly, from racing a cute cloud character to transforming Yooka and Laylee into objects like an attack helicopter or a school of piranha to complete special tasks. I love the creativity of these challenges, and the thrill that accompanied each clever or difficult objective. With 145 Pagies spread across worlds and hub area, I was never at a loss of things to do \u2013 this is a long game.Fun homages to the genre's history are scattered everywhere. You encounter things like mine cart missions similar to those found in various Donkey Kong Country games, as well as a polygonal dinosaur named Rextro Sixtyfourus, who lets you play arcade-style minigames like a top-down kart racer and a lane-based auto-runner. These are good ways to earn a handful of Pagies during the story, but they boil down to little more than a quick nostalgic detour.Each world also contains a unique boss battle. These encounters challenge you in ways no other sequence in the adventure does. I don't want to spoil the battles, but I enjoyed every one of them to the point where it's difficult to pick a favorite. Unfortunately, some of the battles are difficult to find; two of them are even hidden behind seemingly inconsequential side missions.Exploration is a large part of Yooka-Laylee. As soon as you enter a world, you wander around trying to find things to collect. I had a blast branching from one area to the next, and the excitement that comes from discovering a secret area is unrivaled by anything else in this game. While the exploration-based structure works to the game's advantage the vast majority of the time, its insistence on not including modern conventions like waypoints or maps can lead to long stretches of running around in circles trying to find the next mission to complete.The gameplay and structure lay the nostalgia on thick, but even those parts of Yooka-Laylee pale in comparison to the narrative. Whenever characters speak, the onscreen text is accompanied by grunting sounds like those found in Banjo-Kazooie. This is a charming callback at first, but when you're out in the hub world and the main villain begins taunting you repeatedly, it becomes annoying.Yooka-Laylee liberally shatters the fourth wall by acknowledging its own existence as a game. Each time dialogue happened between characters, I eagerly awaited jokes about other games. You even get herded through quiz-style sequences; thankfully, these don't serve as roadblocks as much as they do fun allusions to games like Banjo-Kazooie. I laughed out loud at these silly references on multiple occasions, and some of the fun story moments are just as amusing as the gameplay.Though camera problems and\u00a0outdated level design are present at times, the moments of exhilaration, discovery, and satisfaction far outweigh those pitfalls. It feels like ages since I've played something like Yooka-Laylee. This is a game that was built for those who look back with fondness on the classics that spawned it, and in that regard, it delivers completely.\u00a0\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer. All Rights Reserved.\nPolygon, Filed under:Yooka-Laylee is proof that sometimes our fondest memories should stay in the past.The Kickstarter success story promised a new version of classic Rare-developed titles from the Nintendo 64 era, recapturing our fuzzy memories of games like the Banjo-Kazooie franchise, with a bit of Donkey Kong 64 thrown in there for good measure. The game\u2019s Kickstarter exploded, setting records for the crowdfunding platform.Developer Playtonic has been carefully faithful to what made those first games memorable, from the charming main characters to the focus on platforming, puzzle solving and secrets. But well-regarded as those games were, 19 years have passed since the first Banjo-Kazooie, and Yooka-Laylee remains too true to that original formula \u2014 even when it means not ditching game design ideas that feel stuck on those old cartridges.The premise of Yooka-Laylee is exploration and collecting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29387b3c-5486-4fd1-98f9-1e847ac744f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "29387b3c-5486-4fd1-98f9-1e847ac744f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "41cef8a6-0ecd-4fd8-86b8-96851db8e51e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "24e69c1714155f4ad0332bd4752aa1ed927ef08ad89c5045a3ce7c98a36503d8"}, "3": {"node_id": "a94c3ce2-8121-4bbb-907d-29296f54e4b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d5813cdae4469fb088e34198a07347884b8974645649bf51bb1adb431cc4456"}}, "hash": "c1c53b6ef1f6822663badffbe8f37a82395e703e91c87cea0b914d96342607a2", "text": "The game begins as the titular duo, Yooka the iguana and Laylee the bat, realize the book they were using as furniture is an artifact that can rewrite the fabric of the universe \u2014 right around the time a comically evil heel, a corporate overlord bumblebee named Capital B, snatches it away. The book\u2019s pages \u2014 called Pagies, for an extra level of twee \u2014 escape Capital B by scattering themselves across Yooka-Laylee\u2019s five worlds, and Yooka and Laylee will need to gather them all back up again.These five worlds, each with a unique, vibrant theme, are crammed full of activities and diversions. Every single activity is in service of collecting pages. And those activities get more plentiful after the world has been \"expanded\" by using some of your Pagies. Those expanded activities are, in turn, devoted to collecting even more pages.Those include lots of platforming challenges, puzzles, secrets and, you guessed it, other collectibles. You\u2019ll have to dig through each world to find a Mollycool, which can transform Yooka and Laylee into some monstrous hybrid animal or machine; a play token that unlocks a classic game remake; five hidden ghosts that spit out one Pagie when all located; and lots of quills, which can be used to buy new moves.You can explore these worlds in any way you\u2019d like, which is a huge improvement to this genre\u2019s structure. In older platformers, you\u2019d often be forced to fight a world boss before being able to unlock more areas \u2014 in Yooka-Laylee, you\u2019re only limited by the moves that Yooka and Laylee know. That openness is a welcome change, but I felt like every world badly needed a minimap I could refer to, especially when I found myself in random side passages or on top of some precarious platforming structure, trying to remember where something I saw on the last run through was hiding.The absence of mandatory world bosses is fortunate, because Yooka-Laylee\u2019s combat is a chore. The worst of it is found in the game\u2019s shooting. To get an accurate shot, you need to enter first-person mode by clicking in the left stick. While locked in this mode, you can\u2019t strafe or move at all, leaving you vulnerable in an actual combat situation.Another wrinkle: Your projectile weapons are only active for a short period after you\u2019ve grabbed \"ammo\" from berry bushes. Yooka-Laylee often stakes some of its challenge on sometimes making you get to a far-off target before your powers vanish. It\u2019s a common trap that Yooka-Laylee falls into \u2014 laborious gameplay alone didn\u2019t make for a sense of reward, or even a satisfying challenge.For a while, I appreciated the game\u2019s openness. I didn\u2019t have to keep beating my head against things that felt like chores \u2014 like having to ferry pigs dressed as knights across the map after Yooka and Laylee had been transformed into a helicopter \u2014 because there were plenty of choices. New worlds, which also contain new abilities, don\u2019t take many pages to unlock either, so there was a lot of incentive to do the bare minimum in each so I could get new skills, then return to previous areas once I had a fleet of techniques available to me.There are many things in earlier levels locked behind specific skills, and Yooka-Laylee\u2019s most satisfying moments came from using my new tricks in concert to solve sequences of puzzles. All to get that get that Pagie, trapped in a Cagie.Yes, that\u2019s real. But other tasks were so frustrating I wanted to scream \u2014 like a gigantic golf game where you have three minutes to push a boulder-sized ball past enemies, over ramps, and through a freaking windmill without it plummeting into actual space.That\u2019s when I realized I didn\u2019t have as much freedom as I thought. To unlock the game\u2019s final boss, and finish my journey, I needed 100 book pages out of a possible 145. It\u2019s far more than the number you need to unlock and expand all the levels. With 25 book pages on each world, and 20 tucked among the rambling hub, I ended up doing tasks that felt like busy work after I\u2019d cleared all the enjoyable ones.Yooka-Laylee looks the part of an updated platformer, but some of its mechanics should have stayed back in the era it came from.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a94c3ce2-8121-4bbb-907d-29296f54e4b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a94c3ce2-8121-4bbb-907d-29296f54e4b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "29387b3c-5486-4fd1-98f9-1e847ac744f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1c53b6ef1f6822663badffbe8f37a82395e703e91c87cea0b914d96342607a2"}, "3": {"node_id": "a0bbdb95-0d91-44d5-baeb-3deae8829780", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "496896dfa99f4a9b89fedf7afb180239f7fe092edc089fb76dc2c306c81f56b4"}}, "hash": "5d5813cdae4469fb088e34198a07347884b8974645649bf51bb1adb431cc4456", "text": "There was a reason we haven\u2019t seen more games like Banjo-Kazooie on modern platforms, and it wasn\u2019t just because Rare as we knew it was gone; its ideas were very specific to a gameplay era that we\u2019ve evolved past.

It doesn\u2019t introduce many new ideas, but it does rework the existing formula, creating a far less linear version of the N64 collectathon. Ultimately, though, bloated levels and a largely uncooperative camera keep Yooka-Laylee from being more than just a nostalgia trip.The adventure begins when corporate president Capital B steals a book\u2019s golden pages, called Pagies, from a lizard and bat named Yooka and Laylee. The pair figure that the Pagies must be valuable if someone would bother to steal them, so of course they decide to enter Capital B\u2019s building to get them back. That hub area, Hivory Towers, splits into five themed worlds with a variety of collectibles to find, including Pagies, currency-like Quills, and powerups.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Yooka-Laylee Video ReviewYooka-Laylee is about finding collectibles first and foremost, and platforming takes somewhat of a backseat. You can find Quills out in the open, and you unlock Pagies by completing a variety of tasks, from solving simple puzzles to playing a round of golf to, of course, platforming. The focus on a wide range of activities instead of just platforming is actually a good thing, because the camera has a nasty habit of getting in your way when you're exploring levels. It locks into place at seemingly random points and even swings wildly in tough spots, making the platforming challenges that are there terribly frustrating and time-consuming. When most of your time goes toward the collectibles that are the least fun to get, that\u2019s a problem. Once I unlocked the ability to fly for limited periods of time, I started cheating to completely get around tricky platforming sections. However, it\u2019s worth noting that swimming doesn\u2019t suck in Yooka-Laylee, and I didn\u2019t dread underwater sections the way I do in Banjo-Kazooie. Movement in water is quick and easy, so exploring in and around water isn\u2019t a chore.I most consistently enjoyed the hub world, where the powerup collectibles are hidden in clever spots and the Pagies are locked behind challenging puzzles that make good use of the moves and techniques you pick up in the discrete worlds. Those worlds also have their strong puzzles, but they\u2019re less consistent.There are only five levels, none of which have a terribly original theme. The first world is \u201ctribal\u201d-themed, for example, which was also the case in both Banjo-Kazooie and -Tooie. The casino level is the weakest of the five; it introduces a new kind of collectible that can be exchanged for Pagies, adding an unnecessary layer to the collecting process. But the rest of the levels lay out their collectibles well, and finding all 200 Quills in a level always gave me a sense of pride.In contrast to the established Banjo formula, each of the levels can be expanded once, and you can visit each of them in pretty much any order you want.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0bbdb95-0d91-44d5-baeb-3deae8829780": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0bbdb95-0d91-44d5-baeb-3deae8829780", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "a94c3ce2-8121-4bbb-907d-29296f54e4b8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d5813cdae4469fb088e34198a07347884b8974645649bf51bb1adb431cc4456"}, "3": {"node_id": "8bb7ee74-290d-4d93-84e0-82c413afcdb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b89f16a4a8a516aadc6e0fa45f5cd0dc9ecb6ca8d01763ea9954e28757812ea1"}}, "hash": "496896dfa99f4a9b89fedf7afb180239f7fe092edc089fb76dc2c306c81f56b4", "text": "That open structure allows you to control the pace of the adventure since you don\u2019t have to stay stuck on a Pagie or puzzle--you can move on to another world where you might learn a move or strategy that will help you elsewhere. That also makes returning to a world you\u2019ve already visited more rewarding. When you\u2019ve found 20 of the 25 Pagies in a world and are sure there was nothing else you could possibly do to find the rest, coming back to that area with fresh eyes and seeing what you didn\u2019t before is its own special kind of achievement.The other update to the Banjo formula--being able to expand worlds--is less successful. Each of the base worlds is clearly incomplete, but expanding them doesn\u2019t necessarily improve them. Because most of them have additions in multiple areas and directions, their layouts are hard to follow, and just figuring out where you haven\u2019t been yet can be tedious. They\u2019re hard to parse in the same way that N64-era levels were because they\u2019re open-ish but sectioned off in unnatural places with no landmarks or visual aid to guide you. The snow level in particular is broken up into a bunch of areas that connect in bizarre ways, and even after several hours exploring it, I\u2019m not entirely sure which caves connect to which parts.Much like the level design itself, the boss fights in each world feel stale and outdated. Each boss up through the end of the game follows a very simple structure: you figure out their attack strategy, hit them a couple times until they change up that strategy, and repeat maybe three times until they\u2019re dead. But since you don\u2019t need all the Pagies to actually beat the game, these bosses are as optional as any other individual Pagie.Coming back to a level with fresh eyes and seeing what you didn\u2019t before is its own special kind of achievement.20 hours of hunting collectibles and fighting simple bosses later, I had found the bare minimum amount of Pagies necessary to move on to the end of the game and couldn\u2019t justify finding any more than that. The ones I hadn\u2019t yet collected were not worth either the time it would take or the frustration I\u2019d have to endure to get them.I stayed as long as I did because of my own nostalgia. Although there aren\u2019t references outright, Yooka-Laylee has plenty of Banjo parallels. The lizard-and-bat duo are nearly identical in personality to Banjo and Kazooie, with Laylee making the majority of the snarky comments and Yooka being the voice of reason. On top of that, the collectibles and moves are very similar in function to their counterparts in the Banjo games, and the music features many of the same familiar motifs. But Yooka-Laylee also lacks new ideas, and the twists it introduces aren\u2019t entirely successful.Ultimately, Yooka-Laylee\u2019s best and worst aspects come directly from its predecessor. Despite attempts at modernizing the formula, its style of gameplay is still outdated, and it doesn\u2019t stay challenging or interesting for long as a result. But if you\u2019re looking for a faithful return to the Banjo-Kazooie formula, Yooka-Laylee certainly delivers--from the font to the music to the wealth of collectibles, it\u2019s worthy of the title of spiritual successor.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nKotaku, Yooka-Laylee is a bright and enthusiastic throwback to classic 3D platforming. It is adventurous and full of discoveries. It is silly and irreverent, never taking itself seriously. But it also wears out its welcome fast, spiraling players into a ceaseless collectathon full of frustrating puzzles, technical difficulties, and aimlessness. It has brought back the best of 3D platforming, but also the worst.Originally published on 4/4/2017Players take control of a cartoon lizard (Yooka) and his bat partner (Laylee) in a journey to collect the pages of a magical tome after it is stolen from the greedy corporate magnate Capital B. Along the way, they dive into various books to explore their inner world. From jungle ruins to the far reaches of space, the duo searches to collect an assortment of shiny tokens and plot trinkets.A self titled \u201cRare-vival\u201d, Yooka-Laylee pulls from a roster of former Rare developers in an effort to recreate the magic of games like Banjo-Kazooie or Donkey Kong 64.

Bouncy music and sound design brims with arcade charm and the expansive levels full of things to climb and jump look like they\u2019ve leaped from the Nintendo 64. Levels are abstract puzzle boxes, shifting cartoon spaces full of anthropomorphic pals to help. Items jingle musical tunes when you collect them. The two lead characters play as a tandem, Laylee riding on Yooka\u2019s back, similarly to how the bird Kazooie pocketed herself in the backpack of Banjo the bear. A mad scientist offers silly transformations in lieu of the tasteless witch doctor Mumbo Jumbo. If anything else, Yooka-Laylee delivers on the promise of nostalgia.Platforming is the chief design concern at the center of Yooka-Laylee. A majority of the game is spent leaping dangerous gaps or climbing large structures. Yooka-Laylee\u2019s strongest aspect is how joyful it is to control. Jumping is quick, with copious amounts of fall control that allows for easy navigation. As you play, you acquire new moves such as the ability to soar into the sky or roll around in a tight ball. The game even includes a Sonic the Hedgehog style spin-dash. There is a clear care placed into the game\u2019s controls. Moving around Yooka-Laylee\u2019s game world is consistently enjoyable.There\u2019s a hell of a lot to explore here as well. Yooka-Laylee is a huge game. Although there\u2019s only five levels, the game allows you to expand their size by spending some plot tokens. The levels are large to begin with, packed with hidden collectables. Watching them balloon in size is exciting. It feels like the developers are adding a new section to a theme park. New mountains will spring into being and previously unreachable sections of a level will open. It\u2019s an intelligent piece of design that adds dynamism to the levels. The worlds feel very much alive. They transform and grow. The inhabitants adjust to the changes. It\u2019s like turning the page in a story book.Yooka-Laylee is a varied game, almost over-eager to impress. While a majority of time is spent on exploration and platforming, levels hold numerous side activities. There are races down slides, arcade tribute games in the style of the NES\u2019 Micro Machines, combat segments, stealthy sneak missions using your chameleon powers, Donkey Kong-style mine-cart challenges, and isometric dungeons. The check-list is enormous and impressive.The Yooka-Laylee team\u2019s effort to consistently  surprise comes at the cost of any consistent tone. The game\u2019s energy is manic, whipping back and forth. At the worst moments, it seems desperate and lacks coherency. For example, during one stretch of gameplay I went from a platforming race to a memory puzzle and to a pachinko game within the span of ten minutes. I was enjoying the challenge of exploring the world but suddenly the game wanted me to play a knock off version of Temple Run and then test my luck at slot machines. After a while, it gets exhausting. This wearing of the game\u2019s welcome is intensified by the occasional eruption of technical difficulties. Frame rate will dip, the camera will launch into conniptions, and you might launch yourself into a wall. It\u2019s wacky stuff. Too wacky.Playing Yooka-Laylee for any great length of time reveals that the center cannot hold. The initially exciting worlds start to become confusing as the means to collect new items become increasingly convoluted. Find the raincloud and feed him water, dive into the river and hit the switch, then chase a trinket through a bubble maze. Find the piglet, solve his riddle, climb a mountain, fight a boss, find the next piglet, and keep going. Treasure lies at the end of the rainbow, we promise! You\u2019ll stare at sections of the level which undoubtedly guard collectables without any clear conveyance of how to proceed. There is satisfaction to be found in discovering the solutions but Yooka-Laylee is horrible at explaining itself. More often than not, you\u2019ll find you\u2019ve bypassed intended solutions that require absurd feats of platforming.Backtracking is common, with newly unlocked abilities providing solutions to puzzles that you first saw hours ago.

The game seems to revel in your confusion and no amount of self-aware joking or camera mugging excuses the descent into aimless wandering. It too often feels like the game is wasting your time.This is no more clear than an astoundingly stupid decision towards the middle of the game. Having endeavored for hours to reach what was ostensibly the end of the game and continually being informed that the end was in sight, I reached the door of the final boss only to be informed that I needed to double my collection of magical trinkets in order to proceed. I would have willingly returned to Yooka-Laylee\u2019s bright worlds on my own time. Instead, I put down my controller and stopped playing. It\u2019s an audacious and transparent attempt to extend game time.Yooka-Laylee wants to be loved. It wants to be your best friend and pulls out all of the stops to captivate the player. It preys on nostalgia, offering a host of colorful characters, awesome levels, and goofy gameplay. These are the aspects we look back on fondly when recalling Banjo-Kazooie or Super Mario 64. Yooka-Laylee promises all of these things and more. It dangles a dreamworld before the player bustling with possibility. It doesn\u2019t just promise a fun experience; it teases a return to childhood. It\u2019s a trap and all that remains is a fawning game that refuses to let the player go. What starts as playful and inviting slowly devolves into a digital hostage situation where players need to pay a hefty ransom to proceed. There was a missed opportunity with Yooka-Laylee. It seeks to recapture the feeling of bygone games but doesn\u2019t seem concerned with correcting any particular shortcomings. What might have been a streamlined version of childhood classics shifts into a game that not just accurately recreates their gameplay and aesthetics, it also revives their glaring shortcomings. Those old Rare games weren\u2019t perfect. They frustrated just as much as they delighted. They also sometimes wasted your time, forcing you to collect too many bananas of too many colors to get to a meager a late-game reward. Yooka-Laylee is too faithful to those mistakes of the past.Tearing away all of the bloat, Yooka-Laylee is a challenging and satisfying platformer. When it focuses on the basics, it succeeds with considerable flair. Yet, these moments arrive in short bursts that are padded out by confusing and hostile design. They point towards a far more enjoyable game than the complete package. The parts are significantly greater than the whole. There\u2019s fun to be had but it doesn\u2019t come easily. And if I never have to collect another shiny again, it\u2019ll be far too soon.\nUSgamer, This karma chameleon's problems come and go.This article first appeared on USgamer, a partner publication of VG247. Some content, such as this article, has been migrated to VG247 for posterity after USgamer's closure - but it has not been edited or further vetted by the VG247 team.So we're finally here. It's the day 3D platforming fans have been yearning for since they whipped their Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts Xbox 360 discs out the window in a storm of rage-fueled tears.OK, that's a little dramatic. Nevertheless, the anticipation for Banjo-Kazooie's true successor, Playtonic's Kickstarter-funded Yooka-Laylee, has been noticeably intense. Collectable-heavy 3D action games have been in short supply since Rare's halcyon days on the N64, and nostalgia for the genre is certainly starting to bubble over.Let's get down to brass Jiggies, then. Is Yooka-Laylee the one-for-one Banjo-Kazooie successor its name (and brightly-colored character duo) implies?Yes. Definitely. But before you fall on your knees before a gold idol of Capital B and indulge in thankful worship, know this: Yooka-Laylee has myriad issues. It's as buggy as the contents of a chameleon's stomach. Its controls are slippery. The environments are rambling and confusing.

The frame rate is choppy. And every step you take, every move you make, you'll be fighting with the camera.But Yooka-Laylee's heart, soul, nuts and bolts are all 100% in the spirit of Rare's classic catalogue. There's no question about it. No surprise, then, that the premise for Yooka-Laylee involves two animal pals teaming up to find golden MacGuffins. Yooka (a chameleon) and Laylee (a bat) are lazing around the shipwreck corpse that serves as their home when Laylee's \"One True Book\" is grabbed by the game's villain, literal corporate drone Capital B. Yooka and Laylee need to collect the One True Book's scattered \"Pagies\" (they're often found in cagies) and administer a \"Thank You\" kick to Capital B's stinger-tipped bottom.Yooka and Laylee admittedly don't have the chemistry of Banjo and Kazooie. Laylee is barb-for-barb a Kazooie clone, and thus she has an endless supply of insults. That's fine, except Yooka is too darn nice. Banjo was a great foil for Kazooie's trash-talk because he kind of deserved to hear it; he was a bit bumbling, a bit lazy. Yooka just wants to help people, no questions asked, so Laylee's insults feel baseless.Fortunately, Yooka and Laylee share the stage with a host of googly-eyed NPCs who are brimming with glib remarks and tasks. Some of the Pagies you're after are in plain sight, whereas others can only be won by indulging a request from, say, an old cloud who's \"too tense\" to let his water flow, and asks you to provide some \"stimulation.\" The cloud with a prostate problem works as a metaphor for Playtonic: A team of ex-Rare staff who've been holding onto their cheeky jokes since the turn of the millennium and are clearly relieved to just let them all cascade forth. You learn your moves from a snake named \"Trowzer,\" which says it all. My personal favorite quest-slinging NPCs, however, are the grungy shopping carts in the marsh level. As all city-dwellers know, polluted rivers and stagnant ponds are where shopping carts go to die.Playtonic's joy at being allowed to finally do its own thing reflects in Yooka-Laylee's core gameplay, too. It's certainly a collect-a-thon, but things don't get out of control the way they did in Donkey Kong 64. Gathering Pagies is your main task, as they're what you need to unlock new worlds. Picking up Quills, which you exchange with Trowzer for new moves, is your next priority. There are five worlds in all, and each one provides tons of opportunities to explore, climb, and swim. Once a world is unlocked, you receive the option to expand it. Doing so tacks on more collectables, more objects to scale, and more hazards.I would personally prefer a larger variety of smaller words over five potentially gigantic worlds, but Playtonic is a small staff working with a limited budget: I understand why re-using assets is preferable to constructing new ones. My problem with Yooka-Laylee's huge worlds is that they're incredibly easy to get lost in. There's no map, no compass, no radar. Some levels are lacking in notable landmarks. Yooka-Laylee isn't a short game \u2014 you can easily get 15 to 20 hours out of it, even if you're just going for the smallest Pagie count needed to trigger the final battle \u2014 but a lot of time is just spent re-treading old ground in search of an NPC you had to pass over previously, or a tracking a Pagie you thought you saw in an earlier visit.Fortunately, Yooka's \"Reptile Roll\" lets you bowl through levels at the speed of sound. Unfortunately, it's difficult to control. In fact, Yooka and Laylee are a lightweight pair, and are a bit all over the place when tricky platforming is called for. You do get used to their floatiness, but it still makes for frustrating moments \u2014 especially when you're trying to solve a puzzle in a confined space, slip out of its boundaries, and are forced to restart.Far worse than Yooka-Laylee's reptilian slipperiness is its camera. You can technically adjust it however you like, but like a car badly in need of alignment, it invariably tries to go its own way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "205763e8-7828-4035-99cb-8905449c334a": {"__data__": {"id_": "205763e8-7828-4035-99cb-8905449c334a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa1780ba-dc87-4cdb-b2b1-ad2f43671163", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2d561054a46762fb0366e03ebedef3c67d85528b8a3cdd115e853e97df762e2"}, "3": {"node_id": "255a5084-bf51-4460-b7d8-ccad20ad67f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7b19c998764f9c061b701a485c811c5e3320a572c58855b0cc7fc787fd1cf5d"}}, "hash": "33e754c9ddf2fb748b93faaa9393473c6d4e81c52802ae2ea3c1609ba792e1e0", "text": "Sometimes the shift is gradual, and sometimes your point of view is very suddenly thrown askew.

When you're airborne, you can't see the landscape below unless (again) you fight with the camera, so controlling your flight into the wild blue yonder is a bear \u2013 and not the lovable banjo-playing kind, either. Even landing is clumsy and difficult. Flying also threw me headlong into one of the game's more significant bugs. When I first received the ability to fly near Capital B's lair, I immediately tested it. Before I could get much height, Laylee was violently thrown downward and into a wall. The game then soft-locked. What should have been Yooka-Laylee's crowning moment turned into a huge downer.Yooka-Laylee has notable framerate issues too, though to hear the tittle-tattle around the internet, most of those problems are exclusive to the console versions of the game. I played on the Xbox One and suffered frequent pauses. Said pauses only lasted half a second, but even a half-second game of \"1-2-3 Red Light!\" is not something you want to experience when you're in the middle of some tricky platforming.Doubtlessly, hearing about all these technical issues plaguing Yooka-Laylee is a heart-punch for people looking forward to a Rare-style collect-a-thon. Let's cut to the million-Pagie question, then: Should you spend your time (and, depending on your status as a Kickstarter backer, your money) on Yooka-Laylee?If you've been dying for a true-blue successor to Banjo-Kazooie, yes. Go for it. Despite its problems, it's still what you want \u2013 and it's not unplayable by any means. Most of the issues I've kvetched about can be patched, and I expect Playtonic will do exactly that over the coming months.If you're just Yooka-curious, however, sit this one out until Playtonic's inevitable fixes are in place. And if you never liked Banjo-Kazooie in the first place, there's nothing here for you. This is bat country. Roll on. Roll on.Lasting AppealIf you love collecting shiny things, block off some time on your schedule; you're gonna be busy for a while.SoundSome very nice tunes from veteran Rare composers, including the venerable David Wise. Tons of nonsensical Rare-style jibber-jabber, too. Might want to turn down the game's sound effects if you don't want to drive your loved ones bat-ship crazy.VisualsCamera issues and frame rate stutters aside, Yooka-Laylee's candy-colored world is a joy to look at. The character designs are tons of fun. ConclusionYooka-Laylee is built out of the heart, soul, guts, and bones of Banjo-Kazooie. It's exactly what fans of Rare's classic 3D wanted. Unfortunately, technical issues stick to it like bat guano.\n        Sign in and unlock a world of features\n      \n        Get access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "255a5084-bf51-4460-b7d8-ccad20ad67f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "255a5084-bf51-4460-b7d8-ccad20ad67f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "205763e8-7828-4035-99cb-8905449c334a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "33e754c9ddf2fb748b93faaa9393473c6d4e81c52802ae2ea3c1609ba792e1e0"}, "3": {"node_id": "25544001-2b9d-4c6f-acb6-defbc4baf6c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "085566d328cafe5a4585b1ce95e05db0d89e879190ee57c059fd37ceac640a8f"}}, "hash": "d7b19c998764f9c061b701a485c811c5e3320a572c58855b0cc7fc787fd1cf5d", "text": "Close    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nNadia Oxford\n\n          Staff Writer, USgamer\n        Nadia has been writing about games for so long, only the wind and the rain (or the digital facsimiles thereof) remember her true name.

If you grew up with the concept and got every last\u00a0Golden Crown and Banana Fairy Snap in Donkey Kong 64, you\u2019ll be in heaven. For everyone else, that extra dash of nostalgia probably won\u2019t go very far. To be clear, Playtonic does put its own extra spin on the concept.The big one is the idea of making levels larger, allowing one to use Pagies (the main currency, similar to stars or jigsaw pieces) to either open up new levels (of five) or expand existing ones to add new areas. The choice is an interesting one as you have the option to make a level you already love even bigger, or move on to a new theme.With just five worlds to choose from it\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to be constantly struggling with, but I adored the notion of expanding my favorite level, Cashino, and spending many more hours with it without feeling overwhelmed from the start. I also suspect folks who aren\u2019t used to 3D platformers will appreciate the gradual sense of scale. Playtonic could have just plopped people down into some of the biggest sandboxes ever crafted, but breaking them up like this is genius. The return of a hub world with hidden secrets is also a nice surprise.Although the vast open sandboxes are a sight to behold, especially from a pure design perspective, they run the gamut when it comes to beauty. Some areas are stunning and begged me to linger, while others looked like a tech demo. Over the course of my playthrough I got a creeping sense of budgetary concerns, more so than some other recent Kickstarters, which is a shame.Yooka (the \u201csensible\u201d chameleon) and Laylee (the \u201clittle bit off\u201d bat) are well animated and voiced, but other characters aren\u2019t always up to snuff. The frame rate is probably my biggest concern, as are some sections of worlds that I can only describe as \u201cbarren\u201d or \u201cunfinished.\u201d I\u2019ve heard of several colleagues encountering bugs, but I\u2019ve only seen one in my playthrough (a fuel-like item in a racing bit didn\u2019t trigger), and it wasn\u2019t gamebreaking.The writing is a roller coaster of sorts. Laylee, the brash Kazooie of the group, is hilarious in how mean and self-centered she is. Rextro Sixtyfourus, the clear callback to a bygone era and the gatekeeper of the arcade is amazing, and managed to make me laugh without feeling too meta or memey. I sort of acclimated to the used car salesman aspect of Trowzer, but his shtick doesn\u2019t always land, and I mostly just appreciated Laylee\u2019s riffs off of him. Yooka\u2019s deadpan humor and straight man act help balance out many of the interactions.Grant Kirkhope, David Wise, and Steve Burke really outdid themselves with the soundtrack though. It hits all the right nostalgic notes (literally), almost like some of it was transposed directly out of the Nintendo 64 era. Yet, there\u2019s plenty of tracks that allow Yooka-Laylee to breathe a little on its own, and several that inspired me to buy a CD outright when it becomes available. It\u2019s that good.Yooka-Laylee\u00a0tries really hard in just about every aspect, even if it\u2019s held back technically. So many quests are more than just \u201cgo fetch this Pagie,\u201d as the team cleverly works in scavenger hunts with their imaginative landscapes to paint a cohesive puzzle platforming flow. With five stages, no concept ever outstays its welcome, and even though some ideas repeat (transforming, mine cart obstacle courses, boss fights) they\u2019re usually flipped on their head each time you encounter them.So what else is there after you\u2019ve collected the 100 Pagies necessary to fight the (brutally old school) final boss?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7d4c2d3-217e-4672-9c31-79f9f6be09ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7d4c2d3-217e-4672-9c31-79f9f6be09ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "25544001-2b9d-4c6f-acb6-defbc4baf6c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "085566d328cafe5a4585b1ce95e05db0d89e879190ee57c059fd37ceac640a8f"}, "3": {"node_id": "e182aca4-ad86-4dfd-a7aa-7f1426e890d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "39370216dbc18c8e97ff09aadf27b6e095c076d139662eb9a8b920d746a948b8"}}, "hash": "fbb98b3edbcde2cd84c2d58fa3ebfda7537b69ac4f0eaaed79e8d6633d175100", "text": "Well you can go for a full Quill run (you only need a small percentage of them to buy all of the game\u2019s abilities, but there\u2019s 200 per stage to find) and all of the collectibles, which will push your roughly 15-hour adventure up a bit \u2014 or opt to mess around with the six on-hand multiplayer games that are unlocked from the start. They\u2019re Mario Party\u00a0holdovers, but the option to go at them solo in a score attack setting is appreciated.Out of all six I\u2019d say half of them are fun to boot up with a crowd (of up to four), and the other half are only worth playing once. It\u2019s a nice mix of cart racing, foot races, and brawls that will likely hold your interest for a short while as long as you have at least one willing participant.It\u2019s cool of Playtonic to add in some extra little nostalgia here, but with so many great multiplayer games on the market now (and the fact that every platform can support four players, whereas the era\u00a0Yooka\u00a0is re-creating didn\u2019t have that luxury), it pales in comparison. There\u2019s also a kinda sorta\u00a0co-op feature in the form of a \u201chelper\u201d cursor, but it might as well not even be in there \u2014 so don\u2019t count on actual co-op if you heard that term used in marketing.\u00a0Banjo Threeie is probably never going to happen, but after playing\u00a0Yooka-Laylee\u00a0I\u2019m fine with that for the first time in 17 years.\u00a0Playtonic\u2019s first foray is rough around the edges, but the center is so full of heart that it\u2019ll melt away the more you play it. How much of that roughness you can put up with entirely depends on your history and mental fortitude for mascot platformers. For some of you that threshold is pretty low, but for me, it\u2019s as high as Laylee can fly.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher. I also backed the game\u2019s Kickstarter\u00a0at the \u00a320 level.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back.

Even more specifically, and with I'm-not-crying-you're-crying misty eyes, I still look back on Rare\u2019s rise to Nintendo 64 prominence through a certain childish awe, recalling how the British hit factory pumped out gem after gem with almost no signs of slowing down. It\u2019s with this reverence that I approach Yooka-Laylee, a modern homage to that golden era, created by some of the very same people who helped bring about the 3D platforming revolution in the first place.

Despite some nitpicking complaints, I\u2019m not the least bit disappointed.Playtonic sets up its Kickstarter success story in typical and undeniably cheeky ex-Rare fashion: Capital B, evil owner and antagonistic operator of Hivory Towers (and virtual stand-in for Despicable Me\u2019s Gru), has conspired with duck sidekick and \u2018henchmanager\u2019 Dr. Quack to create a giant vacuum contraption. Why, praytell? To inhale the world\u2019s supply of books. You know, so they can corner the market on those trendy bound tomes. In the process, Yooka and Laylee\u2019s magical One Book gets sucked into the sky, its pages\u2014or Pagies, as they\u2019re called\u2014scattered about like so many gilded scribblings. Excellent. Now there are things to find. In so many words, let the open world collect-a-thon begin.Yooka-LayleeAnd wow is there a lot to track down. For starters, there are the aforementioned Pagies, of which there are 145 total and are used to both unlock and expand each of the five massive book worlds. Then there are 1,010 dancing quills to find; these are easily the most numerous collectibles in the game and are used as currency when purchasing new special moves. Each world also has five wiley ghostwriters to outwit and capture, and even then, that\u2019s not even touching on other elusive items like Play Coins, which unlock cool retro-inspired arcade games, and Mollycool units that allow Yooka and Laylee to transform into various forms via Dr. Puzz\u2019s D.N.Ray gun. Really, it\u2019s a cornucopia of collectibles, and plenty to keep most players busy for 20 or possibly 30 hours.Finding all those anthropomorphic knickknacks is quite the undertaking, as each of the Grand Tomes, in addition to the Hivory Towers main hub, is unabashedly massive. Even before you earn your way to the initial Pagie-funded expansion, these environments are, just in their default state, seriously huge. They stretch out in all directions, from far into the distance to straight up into the sky, and they\u2019re filled with crazy obstacles just waiting to be conquered. It\u2019s something that Yooka-Laylee really pulls off, this sense of free space and scale that makes the player feel noticeably small but not necessarily overwhelmed. Playtonic has crafted a universe that encourages exploration, but has left out the needless busywork saturation which tends to plague other open world games.Yooka-LayleeTruthfully, it\u2019s easy to go exploring in a title that looks this stunning. A Disney-esque fever dream full of imagination, Yooka-Laylee checks most of the platformer trope boxes with stylish panache, from the snow-swept ice vistas of Glitterglaze Glacier to the expansive jungle ruins of Tribalstack Tropics. Each world is brimming with color and animation; some personal favorites of mine are the jack-o\u2019-lanterns in Moodymaze Marsh that follow Yooka and Laylee as they walk by, casting a lovely, creepy glow on them as they pass. NPCs, which run the gamut from sentient grocery carts to skeletons in distress to tightly wound signposts and one very upset kraken, are numerous and full of personality.This also includes characters that Yooka and Laylee routinely interact with, like Vendi, a living, motherly vending machine who dispenses Tonics (earnable, in-game cheats and boosts) and Trowzer, a sleazy sales-snake and dead ringer for Jon Lovitz\u2019s Tommy Flanagan from SNL, who deals in move upgrades and brick cell phone conversations via his illicit storefront. A storefront which, of course, is dubbed TWIT (Trowzer\u2019s Worldwide Incredible Traders\u2014yeah, right). And let\u2019s not forget minecart mini-game facilitator Kartos, who Laylee refers to as the \u2018God of Ore\u2019. The witty onslaught is both glorious and endless.Yooka-LayleeThis surplus of personality is a true testament to Yooka-Laylee\u2019s writing. Sure, it\u2019s full of corny dad jokes and contains more puns than you could shake an N64 Rumble Pack at, but this very British, very Monty Python sensibility permeates the game and is, for me at least, what makes it all so damn entertaining.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02471f2f-aecb-446e-84a8-b861af701df6": {"__data__": {"id_": "02471f2f-aecb-446e-84a8-b861af701df6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfc7aaa821f0fc933334c46d3ac79062c1398563556f1b86eede85e8dd4dfdaa"}, "2": {"node_id": "e182aca4-ad86-4dfd-a7aa-7f1426e890d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "39370216dbc18c8e97ff09aadf27b6e095c076d139662eb9a8b920d746a948b8"}}, "hash": "42c58dd5679d44e94d16356459c659573dcfb39beef4aa55e07e364cadf2e144", "text": "During the course of the adventure, I stayed consistently excited about engaging the next NPC, eagerly anticipating what insanely tongue-in-cheek bits of dialogue would come tumbling out of their mouth. And it\u2019s not just goofy for the sake of being goofy; conversations are sharp, funny, and oftentimes shockingly topical. I say this of a game that is almost painfully self-aware\u2014Yooka-Laylee knows it\u2019s a video game, it knows how ridiculous video games can be, and it has a grand time poking fun at the blatant silliness of it all.However, as much as I\u2019d love to say that everything is perfect in this Rare-ified \u201cRare-vival\u201d, I simply can\u2019t, and that\u2019s mostly because of the controls. Moving the duo around feels great for the most part, as do most of the special moves, like Laylee\u2019s glide and Yooka\u2019s double jump. But then there\u2019s the janky Reptile Roll, which you\u2019ll need to use in order to traverse slippery ramps. This clumsy somersault can be an absolute chore to wrangle, as it controls like a wheelbarrow with a flat tire. Turning is more a suggestion than a command, and the roll transforms some of the game\u2019s more challenging sections into lessons in rage-quitting. A particular boss encounter comes to mind, one that happens early on in the first world. It involves rolling up an incline while dodging and leaping over tumbling logs, and I\u2019m pretty sure I went prematurely gray just trying to manage my emotions during the ordeal.Yooka-LayleeFurthermore, several other key moves show a similar delayed responsiveness, like Yooka\u2019s basic spin attack, which never feels quite as immediate and effective as I want it to. The tongue grapple can seem a bit inaccurate too, sometimes failing to latch onto a desired grasping point or health butterfly. A lot of these control issues contribute to strange difficulty spikes that pop up throughout, and while they don\u2019t ruin the game, it feels like the mechanics could have used some additional tightening. I\u2019m sure it will get addressed in the inevitable Yooka-Laylee-Againee. You can have that one, Playtonic.But sincerely, the control issues are dwarfed by all the good in Yooka-Laylee, this modern day throwback that seems tailormade to yank at nostalgia strings. From the undeniably Banjo-Kazooie-inspired soundtrack, charming game file select screen and undeniably familiar scene transitions, right down to the 3.5 inch floppy disk that appears when the game is saving your progress, the development team seems intent on transporting players back to a simpler time. A time, we know, when video game characters talked in signature Rare gibberish and cartridges were all the rage (well, at least on one particularly stubborn console). Yooka-Laylee may as well have been plucked straight out of an old pile of Pogs and virtual pets\u2014I\u2019m actually half convinced that it\u2019s lost software originally scheduled to release between Diddy Kong Racing and Jet Force Gemini, only to have recently been discovered in some deep, underground Rare vault. I imagine there will be people who won\u2019t find this kind of flavor appealing, who might consider the game to be dated and maybe even outright pandering, but I\u2019m not one of them.Yooka-LayleeWith the crowdfunding success of Yooka-Laylee and it making good on all of Playtonic\u2019s lofty promises, I can only hope that this will usher in a resurgence of similar titles. A new renaissance, if you will, of the 3D platformer. But while I wait for that looming deluge, I\u2019ll continue my nostalgic hopping and jumping, suddenly a middle school kid all over again. If you need me, I\u2019ll be over here with my Gushers\u00a0and Mighty Max playsets, happily accompanied by a chameleon and a bat, reliving my childhood one sweet double jump at a time.Platform: Xbox One (reviewed), PlayStation 4, Switch (TBD), SteamDeveloper: Playtonic GamesPublisher: Team17Released: April 11th, 2017 (US)Price: $39.99Score: 8/10Disclosure: A free review code was provided for the purposes of this article.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"86733743-0044-4bc0-900e-a8c77592e453": {"node_ids": ["dbc27474-6717-465c-a2d8-fdd7a9375026", "f19f8550-304c-46d2-9fae-9dcc58a4acd9", "3d8ad2e4-7a8b-414a-9278-be90ac805bda", "6d1a07e8-564f-4815-998f-be526780e3fd", "369ba706-8a0b-42c6-8d1e-7d0ee13886e9", "f8e10fb3-f060-4a3b-a84d-679385b92e55", "f2b15c06-fa83-4069-8a9b-8268751a2518", "70903e5a-fc3e-481e-a829-7f03b27778e8", "1f4fd555-e158-40b4-b27a-4964db4756bc", "0e9984a8-9ca6-4677-b5e7-cf1ef46fd72f", "41cef8a6-0ecd-4fd8-86b8-96851db8e51e", "29387b3c-5486-4fd1-98f9-1e847ac744f7", "a94c3ce2-8121-4bbb-907d-29296f54e4b8", "a0bbdb95-0d91-44d5-baeb-3deae8829780", "8bb7ee74-290d-4d93-84e0-82c413afcdb2", "d7db2dca-9e53-4e07-81a8-6fc503e7283c", "aa1780ba-dc87-4cdb-b2b1-ad2f43671163", "205763e8-7828-4035-99cb-8905449c334a", "255a5084-bf51-4460-b7d8-ccad20ad67f4", "25544001-2b9d-4c6f-acb6-defbc4baf6c5", "f7d4c2d3-217e-4672-9c31-79f9f6be09ea", "e182aca4-ad86-4dfd-a7aa-7f1426e890d2", "02471f2f-aecb-446e-84a8-b861af701df6"], "metadata": {}}}}
