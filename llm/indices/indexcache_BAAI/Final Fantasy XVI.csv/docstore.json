pseudo-medieval soap opera, with some of the grandest bosses and dullest sidequests in FF history.\n\r\nThe Final Fantasy games are so-called because the very first instalment was to be Square's swansong, its last release before going bankrupt. Another way of explaining that triumphantly ironic title is that each Final Fantasy is about journeying in the shadow of the final fantasy - the apocalypse. In being stories about saving the world, each game also asks you to spend untold hours living with the prospect of its demise. They all explore how people buckle or find themselves when they're obliged to exist in a climate of pervasive anxiety. \r\n\r\nI think this atmosphere of encroaching crisis, with its abundant real world parallels, has played an unacknowledged role in Final Fantasy's appeal over the years. And it's this atmosphere, I think, that really binds together a series celebrated for constantly reinventing itself, from turn-based combat through rhythm-game spectacle to, in the case of Final Fantasy 16, a conflicted but enjoyable hack-and-slash with some engaging writing, beautiful if slightly soulless locations, and a heck of a lot of toing-and-froing.\r\n\r\nFinal Fantasy generally tells its story from the perspective of the younger generation, who must wrestle with a corrupt regime of tyrants and gods or would-be gods. In FF16's case, you play Clive Rosfield, buffest and gruffest son of the backwater duchy of Rosaria, whose younger brother Joshua is a Dominant - one of a privileged few who can channel the power of Eikons, mystical monsters inspired by the summons of previous games.\r\n\r\nClive and Joshua's story begins with an ignoble border skirmish for control of a Mothercrystal, a mountain-sized gemstone whose fragments confer magical powers - the latest of Final Fantasy's metaphors for fossil fuel. But their tale soon spills over to encompass the entire realm of Valisthea, a quasi-medieval continent threatened on the one hand by warring dynasties and their Dominants, and on the other by a spreading Blight that renders the earth unlivable. As in many Final Fantasies, this world's apocalypse is entangled with a goofy rendition of systematic injustice. People able to cast magic without using crystals are objects of fear and envy: they're branded at birth as Bearers, and treated as slaves. Also as in many Final Fantasies, there's a larger, metaphysical menace waiting in the wings.\r\n\r\nIt falls to grim and musclebound Clive - voiced by Ben Starr off Survivor, channelling Christian Bale's Batman - to make sense of the madness, one fetchquest at a time. After a generous prologue and some tragic twists, you set up shop in the middle of the world, sallying forth from a hub hideaway with crafting facilities and shops to separately loading regions. These consist of elegantly bustling settlements and moderately open, collectible-dotted plains, linked by lush paths and canyons, where you'll chat to people for quests that almost always see you ambling to a waypoint and fighting something.\r\n\r\nWhile he has ample stage presence, Clive is, to some extent, the Gordon Freeman-esque straight foil to a Christmas pantomime's worth of charmingly written and acted merchants, peasants, nobles and assorted randos, with English language localisation and voice-acting drawn from all across the British Isles. His role in the drama is to clobber things very hard so that plot can happen. But Final Fantasy 16 is also about making sense of him, not just of his anguished family backstory - which culminates during the first act with the literal button prompt \"accept the truth\" - but also of his status as another Chosen One protagonist, and of how this world exists simply to empower him.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to say more without spoiling things, but Final Fantasy 16 is both the classic RPG tale in which you range around amping up your own legend so as to thwart Armageddon, and a story about how that concentration of agency isolates and alienates you, becoming a commodity that can be wrested out of your hands, much like the Mothercrystals over which Valisthea's nobles spill so much blood. At the (literal) end of the day, nobody can face the apocalypse alone, and those who think they can should be viewed with suspicion.\r\n\r\nThis theme echoes in the characterisation of the other Dominants and the realm's rulers, which takes heavy inspiration from the wanton backstabbing and ambient misogyny of Game of Thrones.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41fab223-d3c1-4790-a6a3-34fe82a67b7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "41fab223-d3c1-4790-a6a3-34fe82a67b7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "beae1d06-8dab-4465-89c9-0cb76b7b94df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "219c59db307b75c91c3d7005c58a91c13eef0b9808b62dd077fb238fc6de16fc"}, "3": {"node_id": "6502d8a9-b700-4e05-8933-7bc41679d133", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5224beeb7ced057648a5f9f63e0d07f12a90c54570fe3d3151f376e2d53ff177"}}, "hash": "963b4a49e8346c96a2fc8c6d056e767f1b17f6487cafc4bdc9143d6e9fdedae7", "text": "They're a pack of emotionally damaged, overgrown children who spend their days fucking each other, fucking with each other, and fucking over their subjects against the backdrop of a calamity that requires a united front. The desire to both tell and critique the classic hero story comes across, too, in the game's trading of the traditional Final Fantasy party for a single-character action format, with Clive absorbing magical abilities from key people he meets or defeats, even as the plot gives this process of absorption a sinister dimension.\r\n\r\nOther major characters do join you in battle - regulars include Jill, a tepid love interest gamely voiced by Susannah Fielding, and Cid, a twinkly rogue played by Game of Thrones star Ralph Ineson, who is sort of FFXII's Balthier except from Leeds. But save for your magic wolf, Torgal, who can be ordered to launch enemies and cast last-resort micro-heals with the D-pad, they're under AI control and largely serve only to distract or mop up any foes you're not targeting.\r\n\r\nFinal Fantasy 16's combat is a change of gear even from other action-oriented Final Fantasies like FF13 and FF15. It's essentially a more forgiving Devil May Cry, carried out in the same environments as exploration. Clive starts with basic sword swipes, a dodge, a counterattack and a few fire-based special moves, but gradually expands his arsenal with suites of four elemental abilities. You can equip up to three of these suites at once, switching between them with left trigger. There's not much in the way of melee combos, but there's a lot of variety in terms of special abilities, and you can eventually plug individual moves into different suites by spending extra XP to \"master\" them.\r\n\r\nOne, thunder-themed set lets you paint targets with electric orbs that detonate and chain together when struck. Another suite trades your default weapon for a blade of darkness which can be charged up by performing attacks to unleash a flurry of telekinetic strikes. Some suites are about crushing counterblows amplified by precision parries, others leave an ice crystal behind when you dodge, freezing anybody it touches. Some suites specialise in aerial warfare, others are about artillery bombardments and damage-over-time. You also unlock a new version of Final Fantasy staple Limit Break - a rage mode that heals you while amplifying your strength and speed.\r\n\r\nThere's room for a fair bit of theorycrafting, especially in New Game+ which introduces new and tougher enemy arrangements per area. You can equip and stack gear items to, for example, reduce cooldowns and amplify certain spells. But FF16 is also carefully designed to be approachable, with several checkpoints per bossfight, and items that automate actions like charging up projectiles. Clive doesn't have many direct healing skills beyond potions, but the game restocks the latter for free when you die. There's also a Stagger system which serves as a pacing device during longer, more overwhelming brawls. Similar to FF13, each major enemy has a bar that fills with damage and incapacitates them when full, granting you a few seconds to wail away without interruption. It creates welcome lulls while also encouraging you to hold a few special moves in reserve for these cathartic beatdowns.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with all this is that little word back there, \"gradually\". Where many hack-and-slash games can be polished off in 10 hours, FF16 stretches well beyond 30, even if you ignore the bulk of the sidequests, and it takes a while to get at the combat system's intricacies. The game teems with playtime-padding scraps against blameless wildlife and generic soldiers. While there's occasionally a supporting mage to spice things up, these foes are really just undergrowth to hack back enroute to the parts of the game that matter. You'll notice that they seldom bother to attack, preferring to circle about waiting for Clive to button-spam them out of their misery. The combat's saving grace here is its well-implemented autolock, which lets you lunge from body to body without paying attention.\r\n\r\nThe pervasive tedium is, however, offset by the scale and extravagance of the chapter-ending bossfights, which throw you up against a hair-raising assortment of laser dragons, war golems, galloping death knights and comet-summoning Behemoths. The best compare to bullet hell shooters in having you dance a path between beams and puddles of energy. And then there are the full-blooded, Power Ranger transformations and nuclear quick-time events that occur when fighting Dominants, which jettison the Devil May Cry comparisons and punt FF16 into the neighbourhood of Asura's Wrath.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6502d8a9-b700-4e05-8933-7bc41679d133": {"__data__": {"id_": "6502d8a9-b700-4e05-8933-7bc41679d133", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "41fab223-d3c1-4790-a6a3-34fe82a67b7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "963b4a49e8346c96a2fc8c6d056e767f1b17f6487cafc4bdc9143d6e9fdedae7"}, "3": {"node_id": "36eedcd2-9316-4a3f-ba02-bb79e9700361", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e49e31b1a375ff388341c5408293e272bc480976d9f739183e2ddaa9352ffc0c"}}, "hash": "5224beeb7ced057648a5f9f63e0d07f12a90c54570fe3d3151f376e2d53ff177", "text": "Some of these mega dust-ups unfold deep underground, others in orbit, and while it's occasionally impossible to see anything for damage numerals and blast clouds, they're also a shade more forgiving than the bosses you face on terra firma. The idea is to showboat and enjoy the fireworks.\r\n\r\nThe quest design also has its ups and downs. The plot-centric missions are engrossing enough, though FF16 does sag into \"visit the next themed dungeon to bosh the next big fish\" territory after a promising first act, finding its feet belatedly in the closing 10 hours, once certain character stories have panned out and the ultimate villain of the piece has been exposed. I particularly relished investigating the spooky barren continent of Ash - a blend of Mordor and Boletaria from Demon's Souls.\r\n\r\nThere are a few enjoyable sidequests, too, which give you a chance to shoot the breeze with other key characters and flesh out personality dynamics hinted at in cutscenes. But the majority of these secondary activities are desperately boring, a chorus of complaints about obscure cooking ingredients, missing people and item deliveries which lead to yet more filler battles, with minimal narrative structure and few surprises. Sometimes all you have to do is walk across a courtyard to talk to somebody else, and you can practically smell the smoke pouring out of the writing team's ears as they struggle to cultivate some intrigue.\r\n\r\nThese errands do a fair job of fleshing out Valisthea's society, admittedly - every character, from the garrulous wineseller in one bazaar to the dying man you discover in one forgotten canyon, adds another, glinting thread to the world's tapestry. You'll chat to botanists about types of soil, oversee baroque construction projects, and trade thoughts with blacksmiths about the art of tanning leather. But it's a lot of repetitive legwork in return for morsels of anthropological data that could easily serve as loading screen marginalia.\r\n\r\nFF16's desire to worldbuild often gets the better of it, I think. Sidequest titbits aside, there's an embarrassment of systems to explicate the backstory - an \"Active Time Lore\" display with nested index cards, a perfectly mad piechart of cast relationships with a timeline of alliances and betrayals, and a character whose sole purpose is to deliver wanky Powerpoints on wider events. It's all grandiose rather than helpful and thankfully, you can mostly ignore it. The same can't quite be said of all those sidequests, which confer useful items, crafting materials and XP, and besides which, this is an RPG - sidequests are supposed to be the secret main attraction, right?\r\nSubtitles. Visual alerts (adjustable size and opacity): an on-screen waveform that provides a visual representation of in-game sounds and music. Choice of Action or Story Focused mode with easier combat \u2013 no effect on story content and can be changed after starting game. In-game items that automate certain actions, such as holding a button to charge spells.\r\nThe worst quests have a corrosive effect on the game's locations, which are spectacular at first but don't really benefit from being revisited. FF16 opts for a \"clean\" high fantasy ambience that sternly rebuffs the sci-fi eccentricity of the last few FFs (the official marketing line, \"the legacy of the crystals has shaped our history for long enough\", is a poke in the eye for the seven-game Fabula Nova Crystallis subfranchise). This is a no-nonsense blend of magic and masonry with just a pinch of the otherworldly in the shape of buried ruins with fancy, disassembling doors - no mechs, no transforming swords, no violently clashing genre aesthetics, thank you kindly. It's undeniably sumptuous, but it can feel a bit dry. Some locations are mesmerising, but many consist of enervating swathes of greenery or dirt, and there's an austerity to the setpiece buildings that disappoints next to, say, FF9's Lindblum, let alone FF7's Midgar.\r\n\r\nThe world is also conspicuous for its ethnic homogeneity, which producer Naoki Yoshida has explained as a reflection of the \"geographical, technological, and geopolitical constraints\" of medieval Europe. Leaving aside the fact that there were Black and brown people in medieval Europe, this justification rings hollow given that several locations take open inspiration from north Africa and the Middle East, with towns that, for example, riff on Islamic architectural traditions and attire, but are predominantly or exclusively populated by anglophone white people (I hedge, here, simply because I haven't been around and talked to everybody).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36eedcd2-9316-4a3f-ba02-bb79e9700361": {"__data__": {"id_": "36eedcd2-9316-4a3f-ba02-bb79e9700361", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "6502d8a9-b700-4e05-8933-7bc41679d133", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5224beeb7ced057648a5f9f63e0d07f12a90c54570fe3d3151f376e2d53ff177"}, "3": {"node_id": "5686484e-5d80-4e69-9e2b-d6bfaeb80418", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0096dd7f5cc60b8549f27544da9027669fe944bfa5be1840e81190b1c31f3b1e"}}, "hash": "e49e31b1a375ff388341c5408293e272bc480976d9f739183e2ddaa9352ffc0c", "text": "I find the deletion of people of colour from these spaces more sinister than the racial stereotypes of older Final Fantasies, particularly in a game that wants to talk about overcoming structural injustice and bringing people together. That \"togetherness\" is worth fighting for, but it's characterised here by what it excludes.\r\n\r\nThat contradiction speaks to the oddly self-cancelling nature of the story as a whole. Again, FF16 is on some level a playable deconstruction of the traditional hero yarn - its plot painstakingly explores how the urge to fight everyone's battles for them may disintegrate into egotism and even callousness, bred of thinking the world is yours to save. But the game's insistence on playing out the hero fable regardless is having your cake and eating it - certainly, it doesn't take 50 hours to grasp this moral. And while Final Fantasy 16 is perhaps the state of the art for real-time Final Fantasy combat, its dreary sidequests and slight excess of worldbuilding leave me reluctant to fire up New Game+. All told, I still prefer the older Final Fantasies, which also trade in stories of heroes averting the apocalypse, but always place those heroes second to the party.\r\n\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nEdwin Evans-Thirlwell\n\n          Contributor\n        Edwin is a writer from London hailed by peers as \"terminally middle-class\" and \"experienced\".

There are two schools of thought regarding that term, with one stating that the phrase Japanese role-playing game is simply an indication of its point of origin, while others insist it\u2019s a distinct sub-genre that any developer, from anywhere in the world, can make. We\u2019ve always subscribed to the latter view and on that basis, Yoshida is right: this isn\u2019t a JRPG.We mean that neither as a positive or negative, especially as the more important question for fans will be whether this is a proper Final Fantasy game or not. It has the name, there are chocobo in it, a character called Cid, and an obsession with crystals and confusing nomenclature; plus, one of the key plot points revolves around giant monsters, called Eikons, which are inspired by classic Final Fantasy summons.The art design, especially for human characters, is more grounded than usual for the series, but the surface trappings of the mainline games are all present and correct. And yet the gameplay is almost completely unrecognisable as a Final Fantasy game. Aspects of the storytelling are more familiar, but they\u2019re presented in a way that will be totally alien to long-term fans. Which means people\u2019s reaction to the game are going to be very different depending on their history with the series.Games Inbox: What\u2019s the easiest way to get cheap video games?The decline of musical excellence in video games: a sonic regression - Reader\u2019s FeatureIt\u2019s seven years since Final Fantasy 15 (as usual there\u2019s no story connection between the two games) and according to Square Enix work began on the next game sometime in 2015. That would\u2019ve been right around season 5 of Game of Thrones, which is almost all you need to know about the major influences on Final Fantasy 16\u2019s story and presentation.From the locations to the bewildering array of regional British accents, including some voice actors from Game of Thrones itself, it\u2019s very obvious what Square Enix was going for here and, to some degree, it works. Final Fantasy 16 is more high fantasy than even George R. R. Martin\u2019s original novels, but judged by the norms of the franchise this is much more grounded and naturalistic than usual.As you may already know, the combat is not turn-based but early comparisons to God Of War aren\u2019t really accurate. Knowing that combat director Ryota Suzuki also worked on Devil May Cry gives a much better idea of what to expect, and while it\u2019s never as purposefully absurd, or difficult, as Capcom\u2019s games each encounter is just as fast-paced and still graded according to how stylishly you fight.Magic revolves around the Eikons, with each one representing a different elemental ability, so there\u2019s a fire one, an ice one, an electricity one, and so on. A small number of in-game characters are able to wield their power and also use familiar Final Fantasy spells under a slightly different pretence, including fireballs and ice attacks. Others are peculiar to Final Fantasy 16, including a bullet time effect and the ability to suddenly yank enemies towards you.Normally, people are supposed to stick to just one Eikon but protagonist Clive gradually gains access to more through the course of the game, opening up a huge range of unlockable abilities that keeps combat interesting throughout.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4213f02a-b41a-46aa-8f10-e84fc5100e55": {"__data__": {"id_": "4213f02a-b41a-46aa-8f10-e84fc5100e55", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "5686484e-5d80-4e69-9e2b-d6bfaeb80418", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0096dd7f5cc60b8549f27544da9027669fe944bfa5be1840e81190b1c31f3b1e"}, "3": {"node_id": "608102d4-25de-4a94-bce1-d61534494b06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "56eb2aa3c84601081a113f93ce1d721e18c2ad9c9f60ffc160fa51b2a3567db3"}}, "hash": "ad0accf7c8c21743109fc315b1bfceaca9c2a36193622aa3cfce7568593c2f32", "text": "And that\u2019s before you factor in the ability to transform into the Eikon itself, which results in several entertainingly bombastic Godzilla style boss fights \u2013 including some of the best use of quick time events we\u2019ve seen in a long time.The combat might have no connection to Final Fantasy mechanically, but the roots of the series can be seen throughout and we consider the foray into real-time action to be entirely successful.Other elements of the game are far less interesting though, with the side quests in particular feeling like something out of a bad PlayStation 2 game. If Final Fantasy 16 had a sense of humour you\u2019d almost think they were parodies of old school fetch quests and yet there\u2019s absolutely no trace of irony in how many times the game has you go from point A to point B to kill something, collect something, or simply just talk to someone.However, arguably the biggest problem is the storytelling, which is horribly convoluted \u2013 again almost to the point of parody \u2013 and relentlessly grimdark. The latter is obviously a result of trying to copy Game of Thrones, but the show was frequently very funny and Final Fantasy 16 never really is (well, calling your main hero Clive is pretty amusing but we don\u2019t think that counts).Everything is so overcomplicated and long-winded it\u2019s no wonder the game\u2019s own developers became confused as to what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s epic and (melo)dramatic, while at the same time being boring and filled with unnecessary bloat.It\u2019s also weird and uncomfortable (given how the game\u2019s cast is solely white European, despite many of the villages clearly being based on African and Middle Eastern architecture) how much of the early plot revolves around slavery, and Clive\u2019s incredibly slow realisation that maybe it might be a bad idea.Except for the combat, everything happens slowly in Final Fantasy 16 and it\u2019s hugely frustrating. That and how keen the game is to make the politics of the world as incomprehensible as possible \u2013 before just giving up halfway through and having you fight a generic world-ending threat.By its end, the game is reusing plot points from multiple older Final Fantasy games and the whole idea of being something new and different gets lost in a muddle of poor storytelling and an overlong running time. Even that might have been saved if the character work was better but while Clive is a reasonably likeable protagonist, and there are some interestingly odd side characters, they\u2019re not nearly enough to balance the books.Final Fantasy 16 would\u2019ve been infinitely better if it was half the length and had a much more streamlined story, in terms of both its basic outline and the way it\u2019s conveyed. We enjoyed it more than Final Fantasy 15 but purely because of the combat. In the end, our biggest takeaway was that we wish Ryota Suzuki would be given his own title \u2013 one that didn\u2019t have the unwanted baggage of trying to be three different games at once.In Short: An excellent battle system shackled to a dispiritingly dull and long-winded fantasy adventure, that takes an inordinate amount of time to say nothing of value.Pros: The combat is excellent and should\u2019ve been the sole focus of the game. The magic system and boss battles are great too, with very deep and versatile customisation.Cons: Everything except the combat is convoluted, boring, and/or confusing \u2013 especially the plot.

Find out more about our reviews policy.Past the pure medieval fantasy, Final Fantasy 16 recaptures a more precious magic from the series' earlier history \u2013 a freeness to reinvent so that you might create something to better capture the moment. Fewer series lend themselves better to that idea than Final Fantasy. Save for props and crystal motifs providing subtle-yet-recognisable continuity, each new installment freely introduces worlds filled with fresh ideas and a new cast of characters.\u00a0Release date: June 22, 2023\nPlatform: PS5\nDeveloper: In-house\nPublisher: Square EnixThe series began through creator Hironobu Sakaguchi's desire to create an RPG akin to seminal fantasy classics such as Ultima and Wizardry, with Dungeons and Dragons then inspiring the idea to offer main characters that you can imagine the backstories for. The medieval set dressing and ambiguous protagonists defining the earlier games gradually gave way, with the subtler steampunk aesthetics and more distinctive cast of Final Fantasy 6 foreshadowing the series' biggest shake-up yet. Final Fantasy 7 doubled down on what FF6 put before it, making the generational leap to the PlayStation with an ambiguously futuristic dystopia filled by Square Enix's most-beloved party of misfits.\u00a0With success, however, comes weight. Each Final Fantasy game means something to someone, so pressure builds to replicate what people love, turning past design decisions into something more akin to rules over what Final Fantasy should be. Rules that Final Fantasy 16 seeks to break.\u00a0Final Fantasy 16 is a tale of rebelling against the status quo so that you might \"live how you choose.\" Gone is the machinery born of magic that's been prominent since Final Fantasy 6, and in its place is a more concentrated medieval fantasy reminiscent of where the series first began. While the framing of this adventure may feel like a bit of a throwback, the action is anything but.\u00a0Hack-and-slash action akin to combat director Ryota Suzuki's time on Devil May Cry replaces the turn-based duels that Final Fantasy has stuck with for over 35 years. How to modernize the beloved battle system has long been a question that developer Square Enix has sought to answer, one which Final Fantasy 16 simply forgoes. It may be unthinkable to ditch something that's seen by many as so intrinsic to the spirit of the series, though it was likely also unthinkable at one point for Square to ditch a medieval setting for sci-fi dystopia, or make the transition from 2D to 3D. Like the series' seventh entry, Final Fantasy 16 gets away with such sweeping changes to tradition by going all-in on the shift.You play as Clive Rosfield, a noble not born a child of fate but rather their older brother. Each kingdom forms around a grand crystal that fuels their way of life, protected by a summon \u2013 called Eikons here \u2013 controlled by their dominant who is ever-present on the battlefield as a symbol to their people. Clive's brother Joshua inherits the eikon of the Phoenix over him, so Clive means to act as his shield \u2013 shouldering the lofty responsibility of protecting them from danger.The earlier portions of Final Fantasy 16 are about getting to grips with your moveset so you may do just that. Clive can dodge around foes and whittle down their stamina until they're vulnerable to greater damage. A sense of flair comes from the blessing of the Phoenix, which grants a fiery gap closer and grander moves.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "757b44fe-2896-40b0-bd3b-fa2690253128": {"__data__": {"id_": "757b44fe-2896-40b0-bd3b-fa2690253128", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "608102d4-25de-4a94-bce1-d61534494b06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "56eb2aa3c84601081a113f93ce1d721e18c2ad9c9f60ffc160fa51b2a3567db3"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5456cfc-7c91-4d5c-a1a3-7116a064fa80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ad7fdde898e047494fcfba65951a07c45455a71506f1d0d2b48d6de063b3354"}}, "hash": "f40e3fe0f6600f612d81fed748e852b2ceaf62598019f916ac161206663dcba3", "text": "As Final Fantasy 16 progresses, you obtain fractions of other Eikon's power that add new ideas to how you might take an enemy down. Using the Phoenix's blessing to close in on a foe and knock them into the air before freely swapping to Garuda's power to pull them back down to earth proved an early favorite during my time with the game.\u00a0Final Fantasy 16's story and tone succeed in supporting the spectacle on show. Set-piece battles between eikons \u2013 where you're able to take direct control of some of Final Fantasy's most famous summons \u2013 are one of the many new additions to FF16, although they can be a slow burn. \u00a0New abilities are learnt throughout the game to make it more interesting, though the biggest benefit they receive is a sense of drama the story builds. Be it Clive\u2019s shot at redemption or the pummeling of a foe who had it commin\u2019, each goliath battle is memorable.Devil May Cry set a high bar for this style of combat, where each enemy is an opportunity for self-expression and the execution of stylish combos, although Square Enix does come perilously close to reaching it. Each Eikon succeeds in offering a distinctive playstyle, and eventually learning a Devil Trigger-style Limit Break adds some further flair to proceedings as you chip away at a foe's stamina bar that little bit quicker. Still, as great as the action combat can feel in Final Fantasy 16, it could all flow together just a little bit better.\u00a0What does win out is the combat's approachability. The design decision to make Final Fantasy 16 an action-RPG will likely open the door to those with a passing interest in the series. However, accessories which can be equipped throughout ensure that every player will have the opportunity to feel eikonic. One guarantees that dodges will always land, while another allows intricate combos to be pulled off at the press of one button. If you fancy a greater challenge, more convenient accessories expand the dodge window without ensuring you'll nail it instantly or cast a healing potion when health gets low.\u00a0The visual design of certain moves, however, can make seeing the screen in combat, cutscenes, and action sequences challenging. One of Garuda\u2019s abilities whips foes into a tornado you can\u2019t see through, leading to a lull in combat as you fire magic into it in hopes of hitting a target. The visuals of set-piece abilities clouding vision also extend to the cinematic breaks in fights. A fight against Bahamut features a Gundam-like laser show, whereas sparks fly in a fight with Titan not unlike Dragon Ball. The visual information overload serves the spectacle Final Fantasy 16 seeks to create, though the cost to some might be discomfort.If Final Fantasy 16's combat is what breaks new ground for the series, it's the story that shows an endearing fondness for its roots. The world of Valisthea returns to medieval set dressing reminiscent of earlier series entries, albeit imbued with the developer's love of other works like Game of Thrones. Empires and Kingdoms collide in bloody conflict while those in power gather behind the slaughter to forge uneasy alliances and get into bed with whoever might make that happen.Plenty has been made of Final Fantasy 16 wearing its heart on its sleeve regarding its inspiration, although there's plenty to set this adventure apart from those we witnessed in Westeros. While both works feature an otherworldly evil beyond the scope of conflict, Game of Thrones is a battle of succession whereas Final Fantasy 16 is one to replenish dwindling resources. Despite sharing a similar medieval setting, the worlds of Valisthea and Westeros feel different enough in the places where it truly matters.\"There's plenty to set this adventure apart from those we witnessed in Westeros\"The more thought-provoking parallels are with our own world. Strip away the symbolism of the crystals, and you see a realm overly reliant on the resources draining its world of life. The common folk are too impoverished to do anything but rely on those means, and the rich simply don't care as long as their power and wealth are maintained. The themes of environmentalism and class struggle make Valisthea \u00a0more recognisable, save for the giant yellow birds running around. While the odd feature momentarily reminds me of Game of Thrones \u2013 like the world map \u2013 I spent more time reflecting on the issues we face ourselves.Valisthea is no stranger to war, though the conflict that sparks the main narrative is Clive's failure to fulfill his duty to his brother in the wake of their homeland's betrayal. The best Final Fantasy games offer protagonists who are both easy to root for and effortlessly badass, and we have that here with Clive. His brooding demeanor and love of the f-word will likely spark comparisons to The Witcher's Geralt of Rivia, though Clive's ambitions and struggles are his own.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5456cfc-7c91-4d5c-a1a3-7116a064fa80": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5456cfc-7c91-4d5c-a1a3-7116a064fa80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "757b44fe-2896-40b0-bd3b-fa2690253128", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f40e3fe0f6600f612d81fed748e852b2ceaf62598019f916ac161206663dcba3"}, "3": {"node_id": "78152ca0-0624-4c83-b2f1-20a998023efa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d555c8fdbfe91921fe11edc2fe4699c91ff0b89009dd772b082baec1dbc84bc2"}}, "hash": "4ad7fdde898e047494fcfba65951a07c45455a71506f1d0d2b48d6de063b3354", "text": "Clarity over his brother's demise is at the forefront of his mind, though seeing how the world looks down on and treats people like him who can wield magic without a crystal moves him to join a cause seeking to free them. Naturally, it leads to something larger.\u00a0Choice bits of dialogue stray to the side of cheesy at times, but not without maintaining an endearing quality present all throughout Final Fantasy 16. There's greater work for approachability here, too. The central hub area you return to throughout the game is inhabited by two characters dedicated to recapping and explaining the world's lore. They're not needed to understand what's going on, necessarily, although they do provide a neat resource for players who may have been put off by Final Fantasy's narrative complexity in the past or those who tend to consume these sprawling RPGs over longer stretches of time.Final Fantasy 16 is similar in its structure to Final Fantasy 15, albeit one that continually builds. You start with the relevant stretch of Clive's teens that influence where he is in the present day, a 20-something mercenary trying to reckon with his past. It's a focused stretch of gameplay mainly intended to show you the ropes of gameplay and explain how we got here narratively. It's not unlike FF15, which saw protagonist Noctis face the betrayal of his own kingdom.\u00a0Once we get back to the present day, things open up with a larger second act. Final Fantasy 16 adapts a semi-open world approach, quite a departure from FF15's wholly explorable map. You are, however, free to wander around and aid the locals through sidequests. While Noctis was free to pitch his camp wherever he pleases, Clive has a home base that acts as a central hub to return to \u2013 somewhere you can stock up on potions, train, or improve your weapons.\u00a0And while Final Fantasy 15's shifts direction in its third act, Final Fantasy 16 fully opens up. The former goes linear as we see the story through to its end, whereas the latter introduces expands your central hub and offers more to do out in the semi-open world. You can visit characters dedicated to expanding Valisthea's history or recapping the story, or seek great challenge out in the wilds through beast hunts.\u00a0Final Fantasy 16's visual performance also greatly enhances the sense of spectacle. While Square Enix has released a day-one patch to fix some of the framerate issues seen in the demo, everything is still incredibly smooth. It allows for gods to knock lumps out of each other in cinematic cutscenes, all while people scurry about their feat as they engage in combat. Final Fantasy 16 has been afforded the development time to ensure what comes out is smooth and complete, unlike what met Final Fantasy 15 on release.\u00a0While FF15 shifts away from the strengths of its map in the final act, Final Fantasy 16 expands upon it. Both games tacke the first two parts of their structure in a similar way by introducing the story and combat before expanding out to a world more free to exploration. By building out on what Final Fantasy 16 introduces in its second act, though, we get something that flows to its conclusion of its story more comfortably.\u00a0Final Fantasy 16 does away with come classical RPG elements, the ones it retains build the world the story tells you about. Doing sidequests allows you to experience Valisthea's citizens' disdain for Bearers, and the fleeting moments of kindness that suggest something better for them is out there.The rewards for doing sidequests are more narrative until the mid-section of the game. You always earn crafting materials to strengthen your sword and armor, though only in Clive's later years can you cash in the reputation acquired for more valuable items and accessories. The same can be said of the open world in general. Sidequests give you plenty of people to meet early, with beast hunts offering greater prey and finer rewards for crafting later.Not only does Final Fantasy 16 bring new ideas to the series, then, it implements them with plenty of polish in a way that makes sense in the world built. More action-focused gameplay sits more comfortably on either side of the button-press sequences of each grand fight, extending the spectacle on show in each cutscene to the gameplay itself. Ideas new to Final Fantasy here aren't new to gaming in general, though few could execute them as cleanly as Square Enix has here.\u00a0Despite the time and polish, Final Fantasy 16 remains a gamble. The medieval fantasy is sure to be recognisable to long-term fans keen to see the series return to its roots, though a stripping of RPG elements goes against what plenty desire.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78152ca0-0624-4c83-b2f1-20a998023efa": {"__data__": {"id_": "78152ca0-0624-4c83-b2f1-20a998023efa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5456cfc-7c91-4d5c-a1a3-7116a064fa80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4ad7fdde898e047494fcfba65951a07c45455a71506f1d0d2b48d6de063b3354"}, "3": {"node_id": "19dffe5e-22ec-4fb2-8906-9720f32dba9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc796aa02654cd3804e885121e27791b7219317cc821b56d5cf4f6f0687492d8"}}, "hash": "d555c8fdbfe91921fe11edc2fe4699c91ff0b89009dd772b082baec1dbc84bc2", "text": "You get swifter, more action-focused gameplay that makes the series more approachable to those who haven't played, though whether they do is far from certain.It's the kind of gamble that Final Fantasy has happily made in the past so that the series may reinvent itself to execute the type of story its creatives want to tell.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nGame Informer, Final Fantasy XVI is bombastic, indulgent, and extreme, breaking far beyond the limits of what I thought an action-oriented Final Fantasy could pull off. It represents a pivotal shift for the series, ditching any semblance of turn-based move selection, active-time battles, or anything else in its history in favor of a fast-paced, extravagant, combo-heavy combat system that continued to grow more robust throughout my 60-plus hour journey.\u00a0There\u2019s a linear action game in FFXVI, and it\u2019s the highlight of the experience. But standard RPG tropes, mechanics, and the game's more open nature outside of the story-based dungeon quests slow an otherwise explosive story about gods, Eikons, crystals, and the meaning of free will. Still, Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s highs are easily some of the highest in the series and even action games.\u00a0\u201cThe legacy of the crystals has shaped our history for long enough,\u201d reads the tagline of FFXVI. It's a theme you\u2019ll see talked about and around throughout the game. Narratively, protagonist Clive Rosfield and his gang of outlaws, which includes Cid, Jill, and many others that make up the excellent cast, are revolutionaries. In more ways than one, they set out to topple pillars of Valisthean society that have only strengthened throughout history, looking to reshape life on the continent.\u00a0The story begins as a revenge tale against the backdrop of slavery; in Valisthea, Bearers, or people that can use magic, are enslaved, traded, and sold to whomever and wherever they\u2019re needed. FFXVI fails to say anything new or remarkable on this front; a miss made all the more glaring given the main cast of FFXVI features few people of color. Inspired by medieval Europe, a majority-white cast commenting on and fighting against slavery and the systems that uphold it, with little insight or representation from the types of real-world people often affected by slavery, is the biggest miss of FFXVI.\u00a0The story eventually drops that discussion to focus on other, more general pillars of Valisthean life that must be toppled. And it\u2019s here that the story shines. Though sometimes a little too close to its Game of Thrones inspiration to feel original, the voice cast behind these characters commits to every beat nonetheless, and it works. Final Fantasy fans and enthusiasts of series like Kingdom Hearts, who love a dose of cheesy love in their stories (both romantic and platonic), will enjoy how FFXVI plays out.\u00a0FFXVI\u2019s story is strengthened by a visual style that, at times, is gorgeous, although there are areas where I am less than impressed, even disappointed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19dffe5e-22ec-4fb2-8906-9720f32dba9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "19dffe5e-22ec-4fb2-8906-9720f32dba9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "78152ca0-0624-4c83-b2f1-20a998023efa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d555c8fdbfe91921fe11edc2fe4699c91ff0b89009dd772b082baec1dbc84bc2"}, "3": {"node_id": "d496bf19-09fb-47e5-8738-666ea7602096", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d892980cbc31d15e4bed508423b740cc2b5a748ab4ee8548d627d1d1e853647d"}}, "hash": "bc796aa02654cd3804e885121e27791b7219317cc821b56d5cf4f6f0687492d8", "text": "NPC models, especially those of non-main characters, are often plastic and stand in stark contrast to the main cast.

However, it\u2019s sometimes hard to see through it all to understand what\u2019s happening.\u00a0The open-field areas are the least impressive. They\u2019re large but mostly unmemorable empty spaces, save for an occasional side quest, random treasure, or horde of enemies. Their emptiness speaks to my largest issue with FFXVI \u2013 it\u2019s an excellent action game, but the same can\u2019t be said for it as an RPG. There are dozens of crafting materials, and I can\u2019t tell you one because crafting is less of a system in FFXVI and more of a word. There aren\u2019t weapons that work better with this type of build or that \u2013 there\u2019s only the strongest weapon, and it\u2019s obvious it\u2019s the one you should craft. And save for some endgame weapons, you\u2019ll always have the materials needed if you complete story missions and the occasional side quest. The same goes for other pieces of gear.It\u2019s the Eikonic powers where FFXVI\u2019s RPG mechanics come into play. As Clive gains the powers of more Eikons throughout the story, he gains access to new abilities, allowing you to rework your build. I especially fell in love with my Phoenix-Garuda-Bahamut combo. Additional accessories strengthened this, such as one that reduced the cooldown on my heavy-hitting Phoenix attack by 12 seconds. But outside of these abilities and accessories, FFXVI is disappointingly linear for an RPG.\u00a0Players who reach the credits will likely have access to the majority of the same weapons, accessories, and skills. It\u2019s how they\u2019re mixed and matched where playstyle diversity appears.\u00a0Side quests are almost always some variance of fetch quests. Talk to this person, go here, attack some enemies, and return for your reward. And while not always the case, many of them feature a surprising amount of dialogue and detail, and it\u2019s usually a great read. Creative Business Unit III adds a quality-of-life feature I\u2019d like to see in every RPG \u2013 side quests with a plus sign on the marker means completing it will reward you with something beyond gil or resources. This marker is how I knew to complete side quests that eventually rewarded me with increased potion inventory, potion potency, and even a rideable Chocobo.\u00a0Plus, many of these side quests build on each other, and as these stories progress, I like how they give life to the surrounding world. This was an especially welcome feeling because Clive is engaged in war, and the narrative of FFXVI takes place over decades. Seeing how the world outside of Clive\u2019s mission changes visually and narratively over time adds extra gravity to the actions I take.\u00a0However, the pace and content of these side quests, and really everything that happened outside of main story quests, simply don\u2019t compare to what the main missions are doing, and they feel significantly slower and less exciting as a result. I enjoy collecting new songs to play in my Hideaway\u2019s orchestration jukebox and stopping in with loresman Harpocrates to learn new things about Valisthea, but these side activities often felt more like doing my due diligence than something I actually wanted to do.\u00a0Perhaps that\u2019s the point. Clive and the gang need downtime after what they accomplish in story missions \u2013 mind you, missions that constantly left me in awe, goosebumps covering my arms \u2013\u00a0but deserved downtime for the characters doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s welcome downtime for me. It\u2019s less that everything happening outside of the main story is rote, but rather, what Creative Business Unit III does in those story missions is so great that I constantly found myself rushing as best I could to the next one.\u00a0I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that there was a moment in FFXVI, a boss fight that lasted what felt like an hour, I\u2019d call my favorite moment in Final Fantasy, and even more than that, all of gaming. It\u2019s unforgettable and demonstrates Creative Business Unit III's confidence and command over the brand. That this moment is nearly topped by another later in the game speaks to the extreme highs of FFXVI, which accentuate the otherwise fine and predictably bloaty lows of a Final Fantasy RPG.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d496bf19-09fb-47e5-8738-666ea7602096": {"__data__": {"id_": "d496bf19-09fb-47e5-8738-666ea7602096", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "19dffe5e-22ec-4fb2-8906-9720f32dba9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc796aa02654cd3804e885121e27791b7219317cc821b56d5cf4f6f0687492d8"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a719b4c-b4b7-41e3-9c05-68ab87921ff4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e370316c80205e4014d520f03c7d05a5462354a8c653278569cfbcc4bddd7f0d"}}, "hash": "d892980cbc31d15e4bed508423b740cc2b5a748ab4ee8548d627d1d1e853647d", "text": "These peaks stretch as high as they do for a couple of reasons. Creative Business Unit III has created my favorite action combat system to date. It\u2019s fast and easy to understand on its surface. But it has a lot of depth, and how far you want to go with it will depend on how willing you are to engage with its various systems. Adding in Eikonic abilities only heightens the action, and I found go-to ability combos I relied on to stagger and ultimately defeat even the toughest of enemies. Controlling the Ifrit Eikon during setpiece moments wasn\u2019t as varied as I would have liked from a gameplay perspective, but the spectacle surrounding these moments makes up for it and then some.\u00a0Those familiar with FFXIV will find this unsurprising, but composer Masayoshi Soken\u2019s FFXVI score nearly outshines every element of the game. And I don\u2019t say that to dampen expectations about playing the game and what\u2019s in store; I say that to raise your expectations of Soken\u2019s score, which features new personal favorites in the expansive Final Fantasy catalog. Wavering between soft piano keys and robust chorus-backed epics that envelop entire scenes, Soken masterfully demonstrates why he\u2019s a fan-favorite Final Fantasy composer multiple times throughout FFXVI\u2019s runtime.\u00a0With more than 65 hours of FFXVI behind me, I still have a lot to do beyond the story, and I\u2019m glad my time with Creative Business Unit III\u2019s latest isn\u2019t at its end yet. FFXVI has some of my favorite moments in modern Final Fantasy, but its lows threaten the pace at which they arrive. I wish FFXVI\u2019s various elements were intertwined more seamlessly. Still, when I look back at my time with Clive, his friends, his enemies, and Valisthea, it\u2019s those highs that I vividly remember. FFXVI is very different from its predecessors, but in many ways, very familiar; And it\u2019s still a Final Fantasy, through and through, reminding me why I love this series so much.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer. All Rights Reserved.\nGameSpot, FFXVI is a bold shift in both gameplay and narrative, yet captures the Final Fantasy magic in stunning fashion, earning a place within the pantheon of incredible entries in the beloved franchise.By \n    Michael Higham\n   on June 21, 2023 at 7:00AM PDTUpon first impression, Final Fantasy XVI struck me with its darker and more violent tone than anything in the series' past. It's not just in the graphic depictions of bloody battles or godlike beings crushing each other to a pulp, but also in the explicit narrative threads about persecution and enslavement. It delves into the death and destruction that follows in the wake of all the political drama and supernatural standoffs. The brutality inflicted upon its victims is laid bare at nearly every turn, sometimes to the point of embellishment, to strike the nerves it wants to hit. But there's a thematic coherence to it all that melds what happens to the people at the ground level with the fantastical elements that steer their destinies. And within that harsh exterior, glossed with magic and aether, is a gripping story about characters clinging to their humanity, the bonds that give them strength, and the lengths they'll go to make the world a better place--all told in a way that only Final Fantasy can.Final Fantasy has always been about reinvention and FFXVI perhaps marks the series' most drastic shift yet. The combat system veers much closer to a Devil May Cry than Final Fantasy XV or VII Remake, and is a shining example of what an action-RPG can be. Eikon battles initially seem to be just explosive set-pieces but grow into meaningful moments that are as narratively driven as they are utterly impressive spectacles. Through the awe-inspiring battles and emotional cutscenes, I found myself repeatedly asking in disbelief, \"Did this game just do this?\" as the soundtrack's beautiful melodies were seared into my memory. However, those peaks are also met with dated design conventions that stick out like sore thumbs, making for some noticeable lulls in the 50-plus hours I spent with the game. Still, I\u2019ll always remember FFXVI for its powerful and stunning moments, for those are the reasons it stands among the storied franchise's best.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a719b4c-b4b7-41e3-9c05-68ab87921ff4": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a719b4c-b4b7-41e3-9c05-68ab87921ff4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "d496bf19-09fb-47e5-8738-666ea7602096", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d892980cbc31d15e4bed508423b740cc2b5a748ab4ee8548d627d1d1e853647d"}, "3": {"node_id": "328ec23f-bbb7-4218-a634-2f2f7eef6b2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "711457b9f58c709a65c4a4f96b23de1166185f7c391423f9108887012df4bb39"}}, "hash": "e370316c80205e4014d520f03c7d05a5462354a8c653278569cfbcc4bddd7f0d", "text": "Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Final Fantasy 16 Video ReviewFFXVI is very much about the growth of Clive and the people around him, but story's initial emphasis on the nations and political structures of Valisthea set the stage for everything that follows. Valisthea is a world plagued by environmental decay and war is fueled by the hunger for resources, which in this case, are the crystals. Because they are a catch-all magical resource, those with the inherent ability to wield magic are abused, subjugated, and treated as property; tools to be used and sacrificed in service of their supposed superiors. Thus, liberation and revolution are the narrative throughlines, and FFXVI heavily leans into these themes, using them as a strong foundation to build every facet of the story and its characters.FFXVI mostly navigates these themes with a deft hand. Its writing often demonstrates an understanding of the complex dynamics that come with the territory, and it shines by empowering characters, letting them and their experiences be the focal points in sharp cutscenes and dialogue. As heinous as the darkest moments may be, they're also crucial to each character's understanding of the hostile world they exist in. It's encouraging to see the game plainly say what needs to be said, though at times that deft hand turns heavy, laying it on a little too thick or overlooking a bit of nuance that could've gone a long way in properly unpacking a theme or perspective. On rare occasions, I found a few minor story events that undermined the rather clear messages the game tries to send. But as a core motivation for the cast, and me as the player, to take action remains convincing throughout, and this results in some great narrative payoffs.Clive and his brother Joshua are caught up in all this because they belong to a royal family that inherits the power of Phoenix, one of the Eikons that shake up the power balance within Valisthea. Tragedy strikes their family early on, setting the story in motion and establishing just how important Dominants--the select few who can tap and transform into Eikons--are as weapons of mass destruction. It seems like a blessing, but it's very much a curse, and the earth-shaking power they wield comes with clear consequences. This blending of political drama, social injustice, and the fantastical tropes of Final Fantasy gives the story room to have the mythical bombast expected of the series but also make it meaningful. The Eikons are a great reimagining of Final Fantasy's summons, and they're smartly contextualized within the story--so for as bonkers and over-the-top as Eikons can be, FFXVI's story always finds itself landing on solid ground.Embedded in the themes of rebellion and the displays of godlike power are strong personal stories of revenge and redemption. The burden of sins, things they've done that they're not wholly responsible for, weigh heavy on the main cast's shoulders. I've grown quite tired of the old trope that seeking revenge is an empty endeavor that makes you as bad as your oppressors, so it's invigorating to have a story put its foot down and give characters the satisfaction of killing their masters to set themselves free, presented without caveat. Nevertheless, atonement is yet another important lens through which you see characters develop and go through the process of re-distinguishing what's right and wrong. Sometimes this means forgoing their privileges, making immeasurable sacrifices, or defying their supposed fate.For all its dark turns, FFXVI is very much a story about love and the various forms it can take. It's a beautiful, honest tale of brotherhood; there's a familial love that I sometimes find hard to relate to, but in this regard, FFXVI cuts sharper than any story I've experienced in recent memory. There are also a few romantic plot lines that flow naturally into what motivates particular characters, and deep friendships that form through shared experiences. And good boy Torgal is the loyal dog who fights with Clive every step of the way. It wouldn't be a Final Fantasy without the power of human bonds manifesting as the strength to carry on and giving its characters a world worth fighting for.These more granular themes work so well because whether it's Clive, Joshua, Cid, Jill or any of the other key characters, their personalities are driven by inspired voice performances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "328ec23f-bbb7-4218-a634-2f2f7eef6b2f": {"__data__": {"id_": "328ec23f-bbb7-4218-a634-2f2f7eef6b2f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a719b4c-b4b7-41e3-9c05-68ab87921ff4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e370316c80205e4014d520f03c7d05a5462354a8c653278569cfbcc4bddd7f0d"}, "3": {"node_id": "632aac11-0260-4e81-b7c6-69d2a3df862e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "982f88c8ca49ff755d0a12324b87f879a8422bd23dcdb2cca20f32cb461dea6c"}}, "hash": "711457b9f58c709a65c4a4f96b23de1166185f7c391423f9108887012df4bb39", "text": "Clive is often the gruff guy who doesn't have much to be happy about, but this makes the moments he breaks out of his shell all the more impactful. When he screams and cries in desperation, it's the sound of someone truly in pain and you feel it in your bones, and when he cracks a smile or lets loose, it's a moment to rejoice. It certainly makes him one of the realest protagonists in the Final Fantasy pantheon. Cid shakes the room with the sheer bass in his voice, and his smooth charisma and sharp wits steal every scene. He's the kind of person that can make even the most aimless people believe in a cause, and the most stone-hearted people bare their souls. A believable human quality draws you toward Jill, so when she pours her heart out or has blood in her eyes, you know she means it. And when each of them rises to the occasion in their most critical moments, you can damn well hear it in their delivery.FFXVI goes for some big swings, and hits when it matters most. It's a tightly woven and focused story told without sacrificing the magic that makes Final Fantasy special. It takes a while to see it come together, and stumbles into a few disappointing tropes along the way. But at its peak, whether it be the sheer thrill of the action or the raw emotional honesty--and sometimes the harmony between the two--FFXVI goes so hard that I could feel it in my heart.A significant part of what had me so invested in FFXVI is the stylish-action combat since it's so tightly tied to the game's identity. While you only control Clive throughout the game, his roster of Eikon abilities build up alongside story events, and the framing of his greatest battles works so well because he controls like a nimble, masterful swordsman with a slew of badass powers he can whip out and string together at any moment.FFXVI loosely retains the design principles of an RPG, with skill trees, a leveling system, upgradable gear, and stats that create a sense of progression. But when you're in combat, your handling of Clive's technical capabilities and Eikon powers are what'll win the battle. You can equip three Eikons and swap between them on the fly in battle--each has two powers on cooldown and a unique utility move that you can execute at any time. Customizing and mapping out your Eikon abilities is key; to be approached as if you're creating loadouts or team compositions in other games. And because these abilities all have properties such as launching, midair execution, charge-ups, or area-of-effect damage, you can get creative with some sweet combos.For example, I often used a bread-and-butter rotation starting with Phoenix's Rising Flames then going into Garuda's Wicked Wheel, launching myself midair before smashing down with Titan's Upheaval and finishing off with a full-powered Windup before mixing in the standard sword-slashing combo. If you just want cool-looking abilities that do tons of damage, you can get away with that, too. But the more you inspect the nuances of how certain abilities can be strung together, the more you'll see the ways you can execute deliberate attack rotations.Brilliantly designed boss battles bring out the best in the stylish-action combat. Typically, you work to bring down their stagger meter then hit them with all you've got, carefully planning your attack sequence to make the most of the damage multiplier that goes into effect in a staggered state, similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake. But these bosses also challenge your skills in dodging, positioning, reading incoming attacks, and reacting with precision and swiftness. As someone who has a couple thousand hours in Final Fantasy XIV and regularly does savage raids, I can clearly see how the MMORPG's boss mechanics have influenced FFXVI. It's one of the development team's many strengths and I'm thrilled to see those design philosophies cross over to enrich the experience.Because the accumulation of Eikon abilities is beholden to story progress, it takes time for the deeper gameplay elements to open up. While it strengthens the narrative coherence with the gameplay, it creates somewhat odd pacing in the first half of the game, and it's a bit disappointing because later Eikon abilities offer some fascinating possibilities and add layers of depth.FFXVI isn't a particularly difficult game, but sometimes you'll run into DPS checks or encounter enemy attacks that do significant damage in one hit, which you can sometimes brute force your way through by popping potions. There is challenge in the purely gameplay-focused Arcade Mode--which ranks you like a Devil May Cry game--and the New Game+ Ultimania difficulty, which cranks the challenge to near-impossible heights, for those who want it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "632aac11-0260-4e81-b7c6-69d2a3df862e": {"__data__": {"id_": "632aac11-0260-4e81-b7c6-69d2a3df862e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "328ec23f-bbb7-4218-a634-2f2f7eef6b2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "711457b9f58c709a65c4a4f96b23de1166185f7c391423f9108887012df4bb39"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c07095c-6a74-4769-98f3-1fdf1e72a6cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "19c64a319bd5afac9dbda781df1a590f836fe0434773c33597967a470e46af84"}}, "hash": "982f88c8ca49ff755d0a12324b87f879a8422bd23dcdb2cca20f32cb461dea6c", "text": "Other than sheer enjoyment of besting the game's toughest battles, engaging with these modes is mostly for leaderboard bragging rights. On the flipside, there are accessories that act as gameplay assists that can help those who may struggle with various aspects of the combat system--options such as auto-combos or more lenient dodge timing don't completely automate the experience, though there are accessories that can do that for you. However you choose to play, it's certainly satisfying to best the most imposing monsters while receiving hardly a scratch with every Eikon ability exhausted.FFXVI isn't a complex game either, as its structure is pretty straightforward. You have a home base called The Hideaway and sparsely populated hub areas for each region that gradually open up as you make progress and sidequests populate these areas to flesh out the world. Once you get access to the Hunt Board, you'll find optional boss fights within these regions that reward you with a satisfying challenge, a bunch of XP, and materials for better gear. But the main quest is primarily driven by distinct combat-focused scenarios akin to a linear dungeon where mobs of enemies are interspersed with a handful of boss fights. Not only do these contain some of the best story moments and cinematics, it's where gameplay finds its groove, hitting an enjoyable cadence of spectacular fights.Sidequests are, unfortunately, one of FFXVI's weaker parts. Having done all of them, I feel they're still worth doing for the way they humanize the people of Valisthea. I would go as far to say that a handful of them are critical for getting the full picture of key characters and their relationships. But outside of those few important ones that reward you with heartfelt scenes, they're mostly comprised of stilted dialogue sequences with objectives that rarely make the most of the game's strengths. It's where the writing occasionally falls flat, too, so the contrast in quality is stark when the main quest has best-in-class storytelling.Where FFXVI flexes the hardest, though, is in the Eikon-versus-Eikon battles: pivotal moments where fully transformed Dominants put everything on the line and fight with everything they got. There aren't many of these boss fights, but the ones from around the halfway point up until the end make for some of the wildest, most impressive spectacles seen in video games. New powers specific to these battles open up as the game goes on, too, so it's not all quick time events or glorified button mashing. And even when they do rely on QTEs, you get a ridiculous display of strength that would make Asura's Wrath proud. I'm not easily wooed by fancy cinematics or super-high visual fidelity, but FFXVI is one case where that technical prowess accentuates the grand scale of these genuinely surprising, astonishing moments.Whether it's in heated battles, emotional cutscenes, or brief treks across Valisthea, it wouldn't be a Final Fantasy game without an evocative soundtrack to match. Composer Masayoshi Soken and his team are a significant part of what makes FFXIV a special MMORPG experience, and their work on FFXVI further proves that the series' music is in good hands. Reverberating piano pieces instill a tranquil and wistful vibe set against the vast landscapes, much like overworld themes heard in FFXIV. The commanding orchestras and choirs bring an undeniable weight to crucial battles. But, as Soken often does, he breaks from thematic conventions to add electronic tunes and heavy guitars that somehow fit right in. Even the normal boss theme had me sitting up straight, shoulders squared, humming along as I whooped on my foes with confidence. And the identifiable melodies that become powerful leitmotifs capture feelings that are tough to put into words: beautiful expressions of the complex emotions that the characters, and me as the player, feel in particular moments. Music is integral to the storytelling in Final Fantasy and FFXVI is a masterful execution of this pillar of the series' tradition.When I hear the new renditions of the Crystal Prelude and the original Final Fantasy theme, I look back at the franchise's rich history and realize just how much of an impact it's made on me and countless others. There are eras of my life that have been defined by Final Fantasy games and my connection to them. Having seen FFXVI all the way through, I'm happy to include it alongside some of my all-time favorites in the series. It's heartening to see that this bold approach to both story and gameplay is now part of that legacy, expanding the definition of what a mainline entry could be. It may fall short in some respects, but it should be celebrated for its most stunning moments and the characters who embody them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c07095c-6a74-4769-98f3-1fdf1e72a6cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c07095c-6a74-4769-98f3-1fdf1e72a6cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "632aac11-0260-4e81-b7c6-69d2a3df862e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "982f88c8ca49ff755d0a12324b87f879a8422bd23dcdb2cca20f32cb461dea6c"}, "3": {"node_id": "81f8c092-688d-4488-8867-fad483a2617f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "95c71aded79ee1b87e2073b14fe141b4440200d3ce58e8684a2b5aadf4228307"}}, "hash": "19c64a319bd5afac9dbda781df1a590f836fe0434773c33597967a470e46af84", "text": "FFXVI succeeds and earns its place within the Final Fantasy pantheon as one of the great entries, and does so on its own terms.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:Excellent action wrapped in an awful storyAfter 16 mainline installments, it\u2019s hard to say that any one thing defines the Final Fantasy series.

Final Fantasy 16\u2019s story is sweeping and plenty melodramatic, but it\u2019s also boring and tedious, leaving me feeling like the game was wasting my time. What a shame that this is the story that accompanies the compelling combat design and encounters that I couldn\u2019t get enough of.Final Fantasy 16 is a fast-paced action game that begs to be played over and over again. You play as the main character Clive Rosfield, once a prince of a duchy and now an enslaved soldier, and you puppet this man from combat encounter to combat encounter between scripted scenes that drive the story forward and excursions to check out the side quests.  Ryota Suzuki, the combat director for Final Fantasy 16, also worked on Dragon\u2019s Dogma and Devil May Cry, and it shows \u2014 not only in the game\u2019s electric combat, but also in the ability to replay every stage in pursuit of a higher grade.Rather than summoning characters like Garuda or Shiva to fight for him, Clive is imbued with the elemental power of these Eikons. Eikons are the physical embodiment of the elemental powers of super-special magic users called Dominants (yes, they are all called Dominants all the time, and no, it never stops being funny). In the fiction of the world, only Dominants can summon the powers of or transform into Eikons, and there can only be one Eikon per element at a time. Each unlocked Eikon gives you a new set of elemental powers to mix and match. You start off with the Blessing of the Phoenix, which lets you close the distance with an enemy instantly, as well as two other abilities, one that sets nearby enemies on fire and another that delivers a flaming kick to one enemy. These abilities are useful in combat not only to whittle down enemies\u2019 health, but also to cause them to stagger, allowing you to whale on them while they\u2019re temporarily incapacitated. These maneuvers are gorgeously animated, too, incentivizing you to use them as much as possible.The abilities bound to each Eikon are as varied as they are versatile; Garuda pulls enemies closer to you, while Ramuh gives you the ability to slow down time and target multiple enemies with a powerful bolt of lightning. Many unlockable abilities change the overall flow of combat. Will o\u2019 the Wisps summons balls of fire that encircle Clive, continuously hitting any enemy that comes in range. Whirlwind, which you gain after unlocking Garuda, lifts several enemies into the air before slamming them into the ground. By the end of the game, you can fine-tune your ability loadout to make a veritable killing machine without equal. At the outset, I was a little anxious that the amount of customization would prove unwieldy \u2014 but by the time the credits rolled, my newfound power felt like second nature.I approached each fight in Final Fantasy 16 with the hunger of an unfed animal. No matter how much I disliked other aspects of the game, every single combat encounter rejuvenated me. Sometimes, when traversing the few open areas of the game\u2019s map, I felt cheated if I beat wandering mobs of low-level enemies too quickly. I needed more: to see Clive leap and lunge from enemy to enemy, to hurl them up in the air, to drive my sword through them, to electrocute them, to set them on fire, to switch between these elements so quickly that the screen illuminated my surroundings with all the colors of elemental magic.It\u2019s fun even just fucking around, seeing what\u2019s possible and how your combat abilities play off of one another.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81f8c092-688d-4488-8867-fad483a2617f": {"__data__": {"id_": "81f8c092-688d-4488-8867-fad483a2617f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c07095c-6a74-4769-98f3-1fdf1e72a6cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "19c64a319bd5afac9dbda781df1a590f836fe0434773c33597967a470e46af84"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b0dd273-5d66-4590-9232-04238d1c8d5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "928e982fa43036029d414565bfcfa39f25b7c966c4e7ba23a475d93579d89fae"}}, "hash": "95c71aded79ee1b87e2073b14fe141b4440200d3ce58e8684a2b5aadf4228307", "text": "Once, while fighting a dragon, I summoned a ball of lightning that I could wallop with my sword to create even more chains of lightning. The dragon opened its mouth to breathe fire, and, low on health, I dodged out of the way, even if I desperately needed to kill this damn dragon before it killed me. I was in luck; the fire hit my lightning orb, activating its chain lightning and killing the dragon all the same. I shouted out loud in my empty apartment.My favorite Final Fantasy games give me something I haven\u2019t seen before, and Final Fantasy 16 is awash in moments of dazzling spectacle. The boss fights in Final Fantasy 16 are a kind of theme park ride: I fought a colossal Eikon on top of a mountain, stabbing its palm as it swiped at me. I transformed into Ifrit, an Eikon that looks like a demon consumed by flame, and turned my flaming fists on the technology of a long-lost precursor race. I fought a dragon and was launched into space, punching my enemy until it was dead, before falling back through the atmosphere. Even the quick-time events \u2014 an aesthetically pleasing but silly addition to most games\u2019 boss fights \u2014 add to the thrills. These set-pieces made me feel downright powerful, providing moments of catharsis even in the midst of combat.If every part of Final Fantasy 16 was as good as its boss fights, this would be one of the greatest games of all time. But the scripted story is, frankly, boring. It isn\u2019t that the characters are unlikable \u2014 I grew to like Clive through his romance with Jill, and found Cid to be a welcome reprieve from a bleak and unforgiving narrative. A lot of the banter during missions also made the characters feel more whole. The world of Valisthea that these characters inhabit is the real issue, as is the narrative\u2019s propensity to hurtle the characters from traumatic event to traumatic event with little rhyme or reason.Final Fantasy 16\u2019s plot is one of the more rote medieval fantasy tales this side of 1960. Although it takes clear and obvious inspiration from Game of Thrones, based on George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire series, it takes all the fantasy tropes that Martin was commenting on and plays them totally straight. The result is a story largely about white Europeans discovering that slavery is wrong for the very first time in their lives.As far as I can tell, every nation of Valisthea depends on slavery to make its economy function. Magic users, known as Bearers, are tested and enslaved at birth and given a face tattoo so that everyone can always identify them. They are worked cruelly until they die, are bought and sold, and aren\u2019t considered human beings by non-users of magic. Cid recruits Clive with the noble goal of freeing the slaves, but this comes with the tedium of you, the player, having to watch Clive come to the realization that slavery is wrong. It\u2019s a little uncomfortable to play as a guy who only realized it is wrong to own a human being about five minutes ago, even if the game goes to great lengths to show you that he was always nice to the slaves.This slavery subplot doesn\u2019t ever make a lot of sense, even though explaining the ins and outs of this system of slavery takes up the bulk of the game\u2019s first dozen hours. But never fear: This extremely uncomfortable and poorly handled subplot abruptly disappears in favor of an end-of-the-world-level threat. The political situation of the nations of Valisthea ceases to have any consequence. Despite how long it takes to set up the lore surrounding the magic system in the game\u2019s many cutscenes, Final Fantasy 16 isn\u2019t very interested in the politics of slavery or in enslaved peoples, nor does it seem interested in its story in general. Disappointingly, some of the finer plot details are relegated to the in-game wiki; the emperor of the French-flavored nation of Sanbrecque keeps menacing another with a very specific flower, and you only ever learn that that flower is the literal symbol of the nation of Sanbrecque if you read a text entry in an optional feature. That such a potent piece of symbolism and character motivation is consigned to an optional menu is a testament to the game\u2019s priorities; the action is the focus, the story a distant second.Worst of all, the plot is diametrically opposed to the gameplay: wooden where the gameplay is vibrant, rote where the gameplay is inventive. During some cutscenes I found myself falling asleep, the characters\u2019 lines just sliding off my brain like water off a duck\u2019s back.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b0dd273-5d66-4590-9232-04238d1c8d5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b0dd273-5d66-4590-9232-04238d1c8d5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "81f8c092-688d-4488-8867-fad483a2617f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "95c71aded79ee1b87e2073b14fe141b4440200d3ce58e8684a2b5aadf4228307"}, "3": {"node_id": "acfa7a9c-bc0b-45f1-8f4c-bc80901d47d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b166d592dea705ec5b32d82299462a739392b56125a1db355b88bf994275e41"}}, "hash": "928e982fa43036029d414565bfcfa39f25b7c966c4e7ba23a475d93579d89fae", "text": "This isn\u2019t to denigrate the voice actors, who are all doing their best with some very tired material. Ben Starr\u2019s performance as Clive is a particular standout, as is Ralph Ineson  of Game of Thrones fame. It\u2019s just that I have seen this exact story before, almost beat for beat \u2014 not just in novels, but in movies, songs, video games, and even other Final Fantasy games. In fact, Final Fantasy 16 reproduces some of the same plot beats from Final Fantasy 14, for which FF16 producer Naoki Yoshida serves as director. As the credits rolled, I threw my hands up in the air, totally unmoved by a resolution I didn\u2019t feel like Final Fantasy 16 had earned. Then, after a few minutes and some hand stretches, I restarted with new game plus. I selected the highest difficulty. I skipped every single cutscene, diving into the action instead, using my very specifically designed set of Eikonic powers to murderize mobs and bosses alike, and thought to myself, Why had this game felt like such a chore just a minute ago? Then I let a cutscene play out, felt my eyelids grow heavier, my exhaustion finally mounting, until I nodded off on the couch. Final Fantasy 16 will be released on June 22 on PlayStation 5.

Final Fantasy XVI feels just as sprawling and even more immersive than your average \u201copen world\u201d thanks to dynamic environments and a large number of side quests delving into the people of Valisthea. But best of all, the care and attention to detail captures that special something that defines Final Fantasy.It confidently wields subtle gestures to flesh out how broken people manage in a dark world where magic\u2019s influence is both a blessing and a curse. Whether it\u2019s the tender caress of a lover or a playful jab at a brother\u2019s chest, intimate moments even out the blistering and occasionally bombastic pace of the main story.A corrupting Blight plagues the once resplendent world of Valisthea, pushing six nations toward war over the massive Crystals the people rely on as a source of magical energy. You play as Clive Rosfield, the eldest son to the Duke of Rosaria, sworn to serve as his brother Joshua\u2019s protector. Joshua, like a handful of other individuals in this world, is a Dominant who serves as the host for the Eikon Phoenix, an otherworldly being of unimaginable power. For the more feeble Joshua to be the host of Phoenix is an unpleasant complication for pretty much everyone involved. His mother despises Clive for this twist of fate with her Malfoy-esque commitment to blood purity.At least Clive gets a cute dog named Torgal. And his father\u2019s love. A tragic event puts Clive on a path of vengeance as he aims to free humanity from the quarrelsome legacy of the crystals, and we follow his journey across three different time periods as he fights and channels the power of the world\u2019s Eikons.Like the best Final Fantasies, XVI explores how trauma shapes heroism and what it takes to persevere against impossible odds. This is a dark, mature story.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acfa7a9c-bc0b-45f1-8f4c-bc80901d47d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "acfa7a9c-bc0b-45f1-8f4c-bc80901d47d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "2b0dd273-5d66-4590-9232-04238d1c8d5d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "928e982fa43036029d414565bfcfa39f25b7c966c4e7ba23a475d93579d89fae"}, "3": {"node_id": "aebd79be-5ecd-4b14-b17f-8c79a60c02ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5396d3e587a961cbacf73e2928646975ca9f3e1c0347889744f2d93f27236e88"}}, "hash": "9b166d592dea705ec5b32d82299462a739392b56125a1db355b88bf994275e41", "text": "This is a dark, mature story. But that just means the light shines that much brighter when good people fight for what\u2019s right.Final Fantasy XVI may seem like it\u2019s cosplaying as Game of Thrones, but it\u2019s far more inventive than iterative in that regard. Producer Naoki Yoshida previously confessed that the game\u2019s initial core development team watched the entire HBO series so they might capture the more Western \u201cfeel\u201d of Westeros. This largely consists of things like overt parallels between the Rosfields and the Starks, and how much the Clive-Torgal dynamic resembles that between Jon Snow and Ghost. There\u2019s even a guy so much like Hodor that it inches towards cringe.Your concerns that this may be just an empty imitation of that saga, however, will quickly fall away.FFXVI treats GoT with reverence and skepticism in equal measure. For every detail that seems to pay rote tribute to the series, there\u2019s a way in which this game goes in a thematically different direction, its narrative focus on humanity and tenderness ultimately functioning as a kind of critique of Game of Thrones\u2019 nihilism.Forget the pointless incest and torture porn. FFXVI  tells a far more meaningful, refined, and unequivocally better story that\u2019s bursting with heart. Everything we love about Game of Thrones\u2014the political scheming, epic conflicts, thrilling combat, and mature tone\u2014is here. But while Westeros is a miserable place for miserable people where there\u2019s very little magic, Crystals and Dominants mean Valisthea is dripping in the stuff. It\u2019s a sick and dangerous place full of people desperate to heal and free themselves from the corrupt powers controlling everything. To do that, characters take a Ted Lasso approach to earnest intimacy. They don\u2019t always fight to save the world. They fight to save their loved ones. For all her talk about \u201cbreaking the wheel,\u201d Daenerys Targaryen did no such thing. Clive, however, is on a much more satisfying journey to destroy the status quo established for generations by the crystals.Imagine if a handful of individuals inherited the power of a god. How would that define entire nations and families? How might the political schemers of the world manipulate such beings for their own gain? How many Dominants would wield their power as a tyrant? And that\u2019s to say nothing of the Bearers, people randomly born with low-level magic powers that society treats as slaves. They\u2019re labeled as \u201cBranded\u201d at a young age due to forced, poisonous face tattoos. Then they spend a lifetime draining their own life force using magic to keep fires roaring for the privileged only for their entire body to crystallize.Final Fantasy XVI devotes a lot of time to the plight of the Bearers, perhaps because Clive himself bears the Brand. They\u2019ve been subjugated for so many generations that cruelty against them is ingrained in all of the Valisthean cultures. Most are enslaved and treated as second-class citizens, and plenty of religious zealots see them as a sin against nature that need to be purged. Magic is at the root of all cruelty, and Bearers suffer from it the most. Bearers are people unlucky enough to have been randomly born with magic, and because just about everyone in this game\u2019s world is white, most Bearers are, too. The way the Bearers serve as a kind of commentary on real-world systems of oppression is obvious, but at the same time, the overwhelming whiteness of the game\u2019s world does make it feel somewhat detached from any such real-world concerns.Valisthea has relied on the Crystals, Dominants, and Bearers for so long that magic feels like the only real currency in this post-capitalist dystopia. Trauma lurks around every corner, but rather than despair, FFXVI explores how people persevere and heal in spite of it all. As in so many Final Fantasy games, these terrestrial concerns eventually give way to more cosmic conflicts, and the grand scale of XVI\u2019s mythos is one of the most interesting in franchise history. Even the most diehard fans who\u2019ve seen every FFXVI trailer will have no idea what\u2019s coming.Clive\u2019s quest leads him into the orbit of Cid the Outlaw, FF16\u2019s resident charming rogue with a heart of gold. Actor Ralph Ineson\u2019s performance as Cid is an all-timer, making Cid\u2019s lofty ideals and roguish charm feel rooted in a lifetime of lived experience.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aebd79be-5ecd-4b14-b17f-8c79a60c02ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "aebd79be-5ecd-4b14-b17f-8c79a60c02ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "acfa7a9c-bc0b-45f1-8f4c-bc80901d47d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b166d592dea705ec5b32d82299462a739392b56125a1db355b88bf994275e41"}, "3": {"node_id": "2b377ace-68b5-4f71-b6b7-3a6bcc618312", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "352a0fa5d099a5d2a35f54395fab45c86b0b8b2b5df5b39d769bfa5832e73ce0"}}, "hash": "5396d3e587a961cbacf73e2928646975ca9f3e1c0347889744f2d93f27236e88", "text": "He never wastes the opportunity to light up another far too-long cigarette using magic, nor does he ever refrain from delivering bits of wisdom with his gruff and gravely accent, thick with years of regret. He\u2019s the beating heart of this story from start to finish, and Ineson\u2019s Cid is an absolute scene-stealer who\u2019ll go down in history as one of the best Final Fantasy characters ever.But there really isn\u2019t a weak link in the cast. Lead Ben Starr is pitch perfect as Clive, capturing a straightforward and earnest gravitas that somehow makes for a likable edgelord.If there\u2019s a fault to be had, it\u2019s in Valisthea\u2019s lack of diversity. Producer Naoki Yoshida told IGN in November 2022 that the design concept always focused on the \u201chistorical, cultural, political, and anthropological standards\u201d of medieval Europe. In other words, these cultures are mostly different variations on familiar-looking white medieval patriarchies like Transylvania or England and represent only a small corner of this world. The game\u2019s Dhalmekian Republic, admittedly, is coded as Middle-Eastern. Yet the Dhalmekian Dominant of Titan, Hugo Kupka, appears Caucasian. The core cast therefore becomes overwhelmingly homogenous.A more meaningful approach to diversity does not seem too outlandish in a world where a little blonde boy can transform into a giant bird made of fire.Final Fantasy XVI marks a radical departure from the series\u2019 traditional game mechanics, but its heavy emphasis on action feels like a natural evolution that\u2019s been a long time coming. Everything since Final Fantasy X has inched away from the turn-based strategic combat of the classic games, and XVI takes a risky leap that absolutely delivers\u2014especially if you\u2019ve ever dreamt of sucker-punching a Chocobo in the stomach.Combat feels like a smattering of Final Fantasy VII Remake, Kingdom Hearts, and the Nier games in equal measure but with a faster pace, but there\u2019s also a lot of DNA borrowed from The Witcher and classic God of War games. In practice, this means that you wield Clive\u2019s greatsword in combat, dodging and parrying enemy attacks, unleashing powerful Eikonic abilities with cooldown timers, and occasionally transform into a colossal, hugely powerful Eikon. FF7 Remake\u2019s \u201cStagger\u201d combat mechanic plays a huge role here as well, encouraging you to go all out during a narrow window where you deal bonus damage.Timed dodges and parries are just the start of the wide variety of abilities at Clive\u2019s disposal. Modest skill trees allow Clive to unlock only a few abilities for each Eikon, and he can equip up to six total from the different trees, all mapped to the same button combos. Hold R2 and press triangle, and you might sweep a Phoenix wing upwards in a wicked uppercut. Final Fantasy\u2019s classic Limit Break mechanic\u2014a powerful attack charged by taking and dealing damage\u2014 appears in XVI as Clive powering up to a \u201cSemi-Prime\u201d state which is functionally identical to Kratos\u2019 Rage, both in its fiery aesthetics and in its capacity to replenish health.As Clive shuffles between the magical powers of the various Eikons he\u2019s channeled, he\u2019ll occasionally scream out their name in the heat of battle. \u201cGarudaaa!?\u201d he cries out in a fit of desperate panic as he summons the air harpy\u2019s massive claws to rip away at enemies. It seems like the tone is ever so slightly different depending on how the battle is going, which is a welcome level of detail that makes things feel that much more believable.Combat in Final Fantasy XVI has a fierce, blistering energy that makes it hard to put down. Epic little flourishes like Clive calling out to specific Eikons only enhances the simpler, more rhythmic flow of battle. Because there are no element type advantages at play and a wide variety of abilities at your disposal, XVI caters to many different playstyles.The item economy, however, feels a bit undercooked at times. Most of the loot you collect around the overworld and from battles consists of ubiquitous items like a stone called Wyrrite or your run-of-the-mill Sharp Fang. They\u2019re used to craft and upgrade gear, but it all feels very standard and obligatory, crafting for the sake of crafting, and eventually lugging around thousands of Bloody Hides starts to feel a bit silly.Over the course of the 70 or so hours it takes to beat the game, Final Fantasy XVI tells an episodic story about the roles played by Valisthea\u2019s various Eikons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b377ace-68b5-4f71-b6b7-3a6bcc618312": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b377ace-68b5-4f71-b6b7-3a6bcc618312", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "aebd79be-5ecd-4b14-b17f-8c79a60c02ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5396d3e587a961cbacf73e2928646975ca9f3e1c0347889744f2d93f27236e88"}, "3": {"node_id": "2c093210-82c6-4312-87e1-a25b23e02c87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "17a99513badd079a23e4f0e8f2f6f94d0768bd0dd59c8bf3d8953ee1768d91e2"}}, "hash": "352a0fa5d099a5d2a35f54395fab45c86b0b8b2b5df5b39d769bfa5832e73ce0", "text": "There\u2019s a formula at play: Explore a new region of Valisthea, encounter a local kingpin, make them your lifelong friend, and run a bunch of errands for them before you go fight a god.

As Ifrit, Clive can hurl fireballs like Goku shooting a kamehameha, but the beast is as fast as he is strong, climbing entire mountains to reach his more mobile enemies. And because each Eikon is the warden of a different element, these encounters present vastly different challenges. Titan, for instance, absolutely towers over you and he can control the very earth, so facing him is quite unlike confronting the others, each spectacular in their own way. No two battles between Eikons are the same, but each one could very easily destroy an entire city if it happened in the wrong place.Beyond these more worldly concerns is a more cosmic conflict lurking behind the scenes, one that contemplates the meaning of existence by delving into the abstract and metaphysical. What are we without free will and consciousness? Does free will enslave us to desire and pain? How important is it to pursue our dreams? In asking these big questions, Final Fantasy XVI ultimately manages to say something genuinely insightful about identity, connection, and embracing the vast mystery of existence while celebrating the power of the human heart. I can\u2019t help but wonder how much of an influence Neon Genesis Evangelion was here.For all it invests in big-scale brawls between Dominants, the game also leans into quieter human connections. Many of the side quests are almost too simple: Go to this place marked on the map, listen to somebody talk, kill some bandits, get a bunch of bloody hides as a reward.

Final Fantasy 16 bears the weight of expectation, a burden that comes with the territory of its iconic name. Each loosely associated entry redefines what it means to be a Final Fantasy, and every fan has a checklist of what aspects of the series need to come together to make the perfect experience. So, can it live up to the titans that came before it while carving out a distinct identity of its own?Final Fantasy 16 centers around Clive Rosfield, the son of the Archduke of Rosaria. Rosaria is one of six nations in the land of Valisthea competing for control of the powerful Mothercrystals, shards of which grant humanity the ability to use magic. At the beginning of the game, The Archduke is preparing to lead the nation into battle to retake one of the Mothercrystals from their rivals, the Iron Kingdom.Before the Archduke can lead his armies against the Iron Kingdom, they march to Phoenix Gate to obtain the traditional blessing of the Phoenix. The Phoenix is an Eikon, of which the Archduke\u2019s youngest son, Joshua, is the Dominant. Dominants can call on the power of Eikons to perform incredible magical acts and can even take on their form. However, when night falls, a betrayal allows agents of another rival nation, the Holy Empire of Sanbreque, to enter Phoenix Gate and Slaughter the garrison.Amidst the chaos, the Archduke is assassinated, and Joshua\u2019s power as Dominant of the Phoenix comes into full bloom. He takes on the form of the powerful bird, but as Clive looks on, the second fire Eikon attacks and seemingly kills him. In the aftermath, Joshua is believed dead, and Clive is captured and forced to join Sanbreque\u2019s army as a Bearer.When the game picks up 12 years later, Clive is bitter and angry after over a decade of fighting as a slave of Sanbreque. The only thing motivating him to stay alive is the hope he\u2019ll get to take revenge for his brother\u2019s death. His chance comes to escape captivity, and he begins his hunt to find Ifrit\u2019s Dominant and avenge his brother.The above just scratches the surface of Final Fantasy 16\u2019s lore. The world-building here is akin to that seen in Game of Thrones, and you get information thrown at you in large doses. Unfortunately, especially in the early game, the lore can be confusing.For example, Clive is branded on the cheek, which marks him as a Bearer. However, the game doesn\u2019t even get into the particulars of what that means for a while. You get the gist that it indicates he was enslaved, but it\u2019s not obvious what a Bearer\u2019s role in Valisthean society is until later in the game.Much of the game\u2019s story concerns the treatment of Bearers. Most humans in Valisthea cannot innately cast magic. That\u2019s the reason the Mothercrystals and their shards are so valuable. However, some of humanity is born with the ability to use magic without crystals. These individuals are marked with a brand from birth and enslaved as Bearers. Some nations, such as Rosaria, treat their Bearers with a modicum of dignity. In others, like Sanbreque, Bearers are respected less than animals.\u00a0Fortunately, the Active Lore System allows you to reference story elements at any time, even during cutscenes. Hold the touchpad, and a screen will appear with pertinent topics. I hope this becomes the norm in RPGs because it\u2019s incredibly useful. At some points in the game, there\u2019s so much going on that you\u2019ll finish a quest and then get 3-4 cutscenes telling you what happened elsewhere in the meantime.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d72651ee-b6d7-4e85-9c3f-85c2405d0c37": {"__data__": {"id_": "d72651ee-b6d7-4e85-9c3f-85c2405d0c37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "2c093210-82c6-4312-87e1-a25b23e02c87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "17a99513badd079a23e4f0e8f2f6f94d0768bd0dd59c8bf3d8953ee1768d91e2"}, "3": {"node_id": "c2b9cb14-aa79-45d8-a7ea-1ff707795fec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "63a406f01da892c6aee65202d8f34c9f94108b6410b08bd7cbbfe59592a246df"}}, "hash": "0f5358db33f5a6c5ef2e6bee441dc21809cc7a9d2ce66354eaba28f99e9ba49a", "text": "Being able to refresh your memory makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.I won\u2019t spoil anything, but the first third or so of the game drags a bit, but once the story gets swinging, I was hooked. The middle third of FF16 is excellent and is right up there with the best of the franchise, and then it falls apart. Unfortunately, Final Fantasy 16 suffers from the same issue we saw in some previous titles in the series.Those who played FF8 remember how jarring it was when the game took a right turn, and Ultimecia, who we hadn\u2019t heard of at all for the first half or so of the game, was the actual antagonist. That\u2019s kind of what happens here, but worse. In FF16, so much time is spent establishing the six nations, the social strata of Valisthea, and all the main cast\u2019s relationships, and then a lot of it goes out the window in the last third.However, while the main quest is generally excellent, with a hiccup here and there, the side quests are absolutely grueling. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re poorly written. Each of them highlights an NPC\u2019s story or drops some lore, but you\u2019ll find yourself doing the same things over and over. There\u2019s a handful of variations, but almost all of the 76 side quests boil down to this formula:The Final Fantasy series has some of the most iconic side quests in RPG history. Things like breeding Chocobos in FF7, collecting all the Triple Triad and Tetra Master cards in FF8 and FF9, and hunting down the optional summons in FFX, encouraged players to explore and provided hours of bonus content. Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing like that in FF16. You just check each time you complete a main quest to see if side quests have opened up. They\u2019re even marked on your map when they\u2019re available, so there\u2019s no organically running into them.Square Enix leaned into Western fantasy for FF16, and you can feel the Game of Thrones influence throughout. I don\u2019t mind the medieval setting as it returns to the series\u2019 roots. However, it\u2019s grim for a Final Fantasy game.While previous Final Fantasy main titles have dealt with heady topics, most entries in the franchise contain a certain levity. Even when the world is ending, you could go breed play minigames, enjoy a hand of cards, fight a superboss, or seek out ultimate weapons. FF16 is similar to FF13 in its linearity and generally lacks the exploration elements that fans love.Additionally, Final Fantasy games are typically fairly mild regarding violence, sex, and language. FF16 punches all that up considerably compared to previous entries. There\u2019s a ton of blood, violence, cursing, and sexual content, which further shows the influence of A Game of Thrones. It\u2019s all to appeal to a more adult audience, but I think it\u2019s going to end up aging poorly.Final Fantasy 7, for example, contains some mature themes, like environmentalism, and Aerith\u2019s death continues to rock the gaming landscape 25 years after its release. However, it\u2019s much more subdued, and the small amount of blood in the game is viewed from afar. It\u2019s a game for all ages, and I continue to get something new out of it each time I play it. FF16 sometimes lacks nuance, and I don\u2019t think time will look as favorably upon it.Combat is another area where Final Fantasy 16 is sure to be divisive. It moves even further back from its RPG roots than FFXV and FF7 Remake and opts for a more visceral experience. It\u2019s not quite as frenetic as Devil May Cry, but Clive\u2019s fighting skills are more akin to Dante\u2019s than Cloud\u2019s.The biggest change to combat is the elimination of the party system. You travel in a \u201cparty,\u201d but you no longer manage anyone\u2019s gear or abilities other than Clive. You have no control over anyone aside from him and, to a lesser extent, his dog Torgal. As a result, early on, fighting was fairly boring. In the game\u2019s opening hours, you only have access to your Phoenix skill tree. You can unlock and level up some of your moves at this point. However, since the game is stingy with the AP needed to do so, you\u2019re going to spend each fight using your two powerful attacks and then slapping foes around with your sword, waiting for cooldowns to end.Things get more lively once you get some new tools to play with.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2b9cb14-aa79-45d8-a7ea-1ff707795fec": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2b9cb14-aa79-45d8-a7ea-1ff707795fec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "d72651ee-b6d7-4e85-9c3f-85c2405d0c37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f5358db33f5a6c5ef2e6bee441dc21809cc7a9d2ce66354eaba28f99e9ba49a"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9a606c5-1f8a-41f6-a50e-efc308f826d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0559a2769361f333f975f1e4b1ea07c2b2fb406a4ce6a1ba09bf770d48ecff6d"}}, "hash": "63a406f01da892c6aee65202d8f34c9f94108b6410b08bd7cbbfe59592a246df", "text": "You\u2019ll eventually unlock the ability to equip up to three sets of Eikonic Abilities, which you can switch between at will during combat. At this point, you can start figuring out which abilities synergize with each other, and if you dedicate some time to learning the strengths and weaknesses of each set, Clive can become pretty much untouchable.While I ended up enjoying the combat, FF16 feels like a big step back. There are no status effects or elemental weaknesses in this game, so every fight boils down to hitting the enemy as hard as you can as fast as you can and using health items at the right time. Final Fantasy 7 Remake found a great balance between action and traditional RPG combat (and even let you adjust it to be turn-based), and I missed the flexibility and complexity of that system here.Final Fantasy 16 goes too far in trying to be the anti-Final Fantasy 15. For me, this series has always been about the journey, and FF16 makes a beeline for the destination from the very beginning. Valisthea is an intriguing world with rich lore, and the game\u2019s cast is great, from Clive down to the minor NPCs. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so confused by the devs not giving you more opportunities to take it all in. Sure, there are a ton of bombastic moments like the Eikon fights and shocking twists, but it\u2019s missing the quiet and silly moments that capture fans\u2019 adoration.\u00a0It\u2019s a great game, but it\u2019s a mid-tier Final Fantasy. There\u2019s a Moogle, Chocobos, and some summons, but if you replace those superficial references, you could slap another name on this game, and no one would be the wiser. Releasing it as a spin-off or a totally new franchise would have avoided some of the expectations and controversy around the title.\u00a0However, while Final Fantasy 16 may not appeal to all long-time fans due to its significant departure from typical franchise elements, there is still much to like in this title. It offers a fresh perspective, a richly drawn setting, and a captivating story that stands on its own. Its action-oriented fighting and darker themes are a departure but also highlight the series\u2019 willingness to branch out. Even if it seems different and isn\u2019t quite the Final Fantasy many of us grew up with, FF16 is still an exciting and enjoyable adventure. It serves as a reminder that the series isn\u2019t hesitant to grow and defy expectations, even if the outcome isn\u2019t unanimously praised.8Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

His childhood friend Jill, who happens to be the Dominant of Shiva; Cidolfus, or Cid, the Dominant of Ramuh; the cheerful and crafty scout Gav, rambunctious Mid, and various other characters who work together as part of Cid\u2019s organization, attempting to right the wrongs of the world. Clive starts out as a bit of lone wolf, on a quest to solve his own troubles. Soon after, he gets caught up in the larger issues at hand.And oh boy, are there some wrongs to be righted. Final Fantasy XVI goes for a dark fantasy setting that feels very, very Game of Thrones at times. Schemers plot and thwart each other. Armies fight and die for control of the Mothercrystals, massive crystalline structures thought to hold off the advance of the destructive Blight that\u2019s destroying the world of Valisthea. And yes, Final Fantasy says \u201cfuck\u201d now.Those born with magic are seen as lesser people, are branded as Bearers. They\u2019re bought, sold, and expended like a commodity, as their use of magic gradually drains the life force from their body until they\u2019re spent. Dominants are the most powerful of these, as users that have control of an Eikon, one of Final Fantasy\u2019s classic summons like Bahamut, Titan, or Shiva. Though, depending on where the Dominant resides, they may be treated as royalty, weapon, or just another Bearer to control.Square Enix tackles a lot of this headfirst, and how it lands can vary. Some early plot beats around Bearers and their struggles land well, while others don\u2019t. Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s highest plot points really, really hit, in the way a super-produced Final Fantasy cutscene can. Seeing giant Eikons clash against each other, the devastation they wreak, and the impressive scenes of battle are a sight to see.That\u2019s not to undersell the individual, more intimate performances though. Ben Starr holds it down as Clive, and Ralph Ineson\u2019s performance as Cidolfus (a.k.a. Cid) is particularly memorable. Special shout-outs to Stewart Clarke, who puts in great work as Bahamut\u2019s Dominant Dio Lesage too, as well as some others I can\u2019t spoil here. Suffice to say, the core English VA crew does a great job, and the impressive renderings of the characters add a lot to XVI\u2019s emotional highs.The supporting crew is solid too, but gets a little less to work with. It\u2019s an overall mild problem, but there were times where story beats or ideas would be set up and then immediately shuffled out of the main plot\u2019s path. Some characters feel like they flit in and out of the limelight, and I would\u2019ve liked to see them get a little more to do than stand on the sidelines of the big fights and plot beats.These story beats and side characters usually get more fleshed out in the side quests, which contain bits of expanded lore or more time with a specific character. Those rewards are good too, as the side quests themselves are often pretty mundane. Frequently, they would task me with a \u201cgo here, do thing, return\u201d structure that would feel a little too routine. Hunts, at least, are a bit more involved; these are special encounters, with unique enemies that you have to actually find and locate in the world using the description on the Hunt Board. It\u2019s a really engaging set-up, and makes good use of Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s zone-based world.It also highlights the combat of XVI, which I will just say is flat-out good. Easy comparisons can be made to other third-person character action games, ranging from God of War to Devil May Cry. But while it captures the spirit of those, it doesn\u2019t lose all of its RPG heart, either.Clive can have up to three Eikonic forms equipped at any time, which he can swap between like stances. He can also swing his sword and fire off bolts of magic, holding either down to charge it up, as well as dodge and take to the air. At any given time, there are a lot of options available to Clive.Each Eikon brings its own power and style to the fight. Phoenix, your first form, is a jack-of-all-trades.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca8c08aa-a0ad-4f58-ae29-7de00bc84ff7": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca8c08aa-a0ad-4f58-ae29-7de00bc84ff7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9a606c5-1f8a-41f6-a50e-efc308f826d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0559a2769361f333f975f1e4b1ea07c2b2fb406a4ce6a1ba09bf770d48ecff6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "54285f26-a0ec-4632-8819-9596be255b95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "233cd7d2c1468b52ec645e0d9ede156e30ee34194244fe8e314ca058161dce6a"}}, "hash": "bf47c249177cd17ce315c1c756db631dc298fba38746fa3a5ad976a97eaf112d", "text": "Phoenix, your first form, is a jack-of-all-trades. But swap to Garuda, and now you have Stagger-inducing swipes and a pull ability to bring enemies close. On Titan, you can armor through enemy attacks for big damage and counter foes with your massive bulwark. As Clive gains the power of various Eikons, his moveset keeps expanding, and each one adds a distinct and interesting new way to fight.Where the RPG seeps in is how the player gets to determine their playstyle. Abilities can be upgraded and eventually mastered, which frees them up from being attached to their respective Eikon. So if you master a Phoenix move, for example, you can equip it to your Shiva or Bahamut loadout. Endgame builds get really interesting, as you start to mix the Eikon forms and signature moves you want, like Phoenix\u2019s dash or Titan\u2019s counter, with the individual Eikon abilities you favor. A playstyle that feels like your own can start to emerge.My frustration, then, is that it takes quite a while to get to that point. A good chunk of the early game is spent with a handful of Eikons and abilities. Combat opens up once Clive can swap through three different power sets, and as abilities begin to evolve and grow. It makes some early, standard-fare fights feel a bit repetitive, but thankfully, that gets better as Clive learns more skills. Equipment can also augment this, but aside from a few different accessories, they largely help boost your resilience, damage, and ability to Stagger enemies into a state where you can really wallop on them.Final Fantasy XVI has a set of accessories called Timely Accessories, which can assist with a lot of the more action-y aspects of the game. Some are low impact, like an accessory which controls Clive\u2019s faithful companion Torgal for you, while others can make dodging easier or let you auto-combo. I messed around with them enough to make sure they work like they should. For those who enjoy action combat, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll want or need to fall back on these; but for those who want a little help, they\u2019re nice for getting through trickier fights.Bosses are where Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s combat really gets to shine. Whether in main story fights or the higher-rank Hunts, bosses bring new sets of engaging challenges to deal with. Bosses will start out slow, but gradually start throwing the kitchen sink at you. Barrages of abilities can feel like I\u2019m playing a more action-driven Final Fantasy XIV raid encounter, as I\u2019m reading AoE indicators and timing dodges while trying to unleash all my moves.It makes sense, then, that Square Enix has included so much extra stuff to do in this game. I\u2019ve already mentioned the side quests and Hunt Board. There\u2019s no shortage of those, but on top of that, you can also replay certain stages or encounters, and there\u2019s an Arcade Mode for leaderboard chasing against specific boss fights. These are bosses that aren\u2019t just fun to fight once, but over and over.On top of that, there is a New Game+ option that bumps up the level cap, swaps up encounters, and seems to generally expand on the entire campaign. Getting through Final Fantasy XVI once was already no small task, as I rolled credits at about 55 hours and still had plenty of side activities left over. But it seems like if you want more Final Fantasy XVI to play after credits roll, there will be plenty still waiting for you.Even just getting words on the page about what this action-RPG is feels like a huge task. Final Fantasy has entries that can feel monolithic in size and importance, standing out as these big system-driving role-playing games. Final Fantasy XVI is no exception.Where Final Fantasy XVI succeeds for me is its confidence in what it is. It doesn\u2019t half-step into its newfound drive for action combat. It goes hard into its M-rated dark fantasy world. Yet it doesn\u2019t leave behind crystals, chocobos, or moogles.XVI\u2019s overall message is one of free will and choice, and the resolution to determine your own destiny. Breaking the chains of fate certainly isn\u2019t new for RPGs, but it feels apt for a series trying to break new ground, and in a numbered entry at that.There are some stumbles and falters, a few places where quests can drag on or story beats fall flat.

Final Fantasy XVI absolutely delivers on the action front, has a compelling story with engaging twists and big payoffs, an excellent soundtrack, and a memorable cast.It\u2019s difficult to judge a Final Fantasy against the crystalline legacy of its predecessors. But Final Fantasy XVI takes a confident step into new territory and doesn\u2019t slip. And for those who want an impressive, electrifying, enjoyable action RPG to sink hours upon hours into, you\u2019d be very hard pressed to find a better option than Final Fantasy XVI.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

Login NowThe latest marquee RPG from Square Enix goes for broke at every opportunity and then some.Square Enix has been pumping games out lately, but this is the big one. The last time a new numbered Final Fantasy hit was in 2016, and the world has changed so much in the time since that it feels like a lifetime ago. Even so, Final Fantasy 15 proved divisive, to say the least, and 16 arrived with a very different team and vision. It\u2019s a vision many long-time fans have struggled to understand, and the discourse to come will certainly sustain itself to the next game and beyond. While there\u2019s plenty of Final Fantasy 14 DNA coursing through its veins, Final Fantasy 16 takes some massive swings. From a thoroughly M-rated tone to a balls-out \u201cCharacter Action\u201d combat system, it\u2019s no surprise to see folks out there once again asking what it even means to be a \u201ccore\u201d Final Fantasy. But by the end, this one feels like Final Fantasy in as true a form as possible.To start things off, we need to make something about Final Fantasy 16's story very clear. This writer thinks the past decade of Game of Thrones\u2019 cultural impact has been one of humanity\u2019s biggest media crimes, alongside the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So when I heard one of the development team\u2019s key inspirations was GoT, my red flags were flying at full mast. Sure enough, when Final Fantasy 16's opening hours erupted with edgy, dark fantasy vibes complete with shock deaths, uncanny horniness, and projectile vomited f-bombs, I was ready to perish on the spot.\u00a0I\u2019m grateful, though, that just as I felt enough pressure building up behind my rolling eyes to blow my brains out of my skull, the game seemed to get most of this nonsense out of its system. As the narrative developed with a level of self-restraint and respect for storytelling \u201cprestige television\u201d producers would balk at, I gradually found myself not just fully on board but emotionally invested. It crept up on me, too; I hadn\u2019t realized Final Fantasy 16 had me in its clutches until I was feeling capital-m \"Moved\" by story developments unfurling during a side quest!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2cde619-17b8-4d8d-8a02-aca00ac45809": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2cde619-17b8-4d8d-8a02-aca00ac45809", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "54285f26-a0ec-4632-8819-9596be255b95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "233cd7d2c1468b52ec645e0d9ede156e30ee34194244fe8e314ca058161dce6a"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e62459b-0ae2-4817-ba20-300097e91ef5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6bf47abba20cf7ac6e9211f314513a55239f3bf36b627a4e1144a0b3b845436d"}}, "hash": "d1b1ac13975dfec9cd3d134e74278d720026822f62bf05a4cbb444f877d4cef4", "text": "There are certainly bumps in the road, but overall Square Enix has something special here, and I am genuinely stoked to watch the conversations to come.This feat (by which I mean my cold, jaded games media heart melting) is achieved by a story that is deeply focused on a sole character arc. The emphasis on Clive Rosfield as the sole player character and protagonist in a genre normally accustomed to ensemble cast stories really pays off. While the supporting cast and world-building are fairly strong, it\u2019s all in service to telling a complete, in-depth character story that spans nearly two decades. Ben Starr\u2019s vocal performance has such gravity and nuance that I believed every word, no matter how corny, and despite spending more than 70 hours with Clive, I was ready to keep going for another 70.The rest of the cast, especially Final Fantasy 16\u2019s iteration of Cid, voiced by Ralph Ineson, is just as good. A top-notch localization holds up said cast as what I consider to be one of the best English voiceovers for an RPG I\u2019ve ever experienced. It\u2019s all the more impressive considering Final Fantasy has really struggled in this department over the years. Here, there\u2019s a tangible care taken to speech patterns and dialect in the script which circumvents some of the traditional awkwardness that can come from localizations of this scale.\u00a0Yeah, that\u2019s a lot of gushing, but the strength of the performances and character arcs is important, as they often carry extra weight when other aspects of Final Fantasy 16\u2019s writing stumble. There was some pre-release discourse centered around the game\u2019s Active Time Lore (ATL) system, which was taken from interviews as a safety net of sorts to help players (and the developers themselves) keep track of an overcomplicated plot. That\u2019s not actually the case... for the most part.The way Final Fantasy 16 handles its massive pile of high-fantasy lore is actually quite impressive. The ATL system is often handy, especially early on, as it merely provides small pieces of up-to-date context for when and where you are in the story. While the story is legitimately easy to follow thanks to strong character writing, having the quick, simple tidbits for things like geography on hand is great. Especially since this tool is very different from, say, Final Fantasy 13\u2019s atrocious codex menus.Higher-level lore stuff is also handled in fun, creative ways here. As the game progresses, you\u2019ll meet Vivian Ninetales, who introduces the State of the Realm feature. This is the proper \u201ccodex,\u201d where you can sift through a complex web of character relationships, timelines and of course, the map. Going over the map is often part of the main story, even, as Clive and his crew often speak to Vivian before bigger excursions. This stuff is delivered like a historian enthusiastically orating, well, history, and goes a long way towards making the boring details actually fun to keep up with.Problems show up when you scrutinize those details, though. As much as the characters drive the story and the lore mechanisms are well-crafted, the lore itself doesn\u2019t hit as well. It\u2019s a problem resulting from too much going on at once, which muddies a lot of the thematic waters. This part is hard to go into without diving into spoiler territory, but there are a couple of examples I can point to.The big one concerns the overall world, and the people who live in it, which, of course, ties into an early Final Fantasy 16 controversy involving diversity. While this world includes more than just white people, it\u2019s also a world that is poorly defined in a cultural sense. Each region has its own governing bodies, and how those bodies operate and interact is chiefly driven by what is essentially a climate crisis. But for all the lore gimmicks and larger-than-life leadership around this world, the actual worldly presence of these nations is weirdly shallow. So when it comes time to move pieces around the board, establish antagonists and develop conflicts, much of it falls flat. Motivations for the villains are either unclear or feel divorced from their status as political figures, and differences in things like how Bearers are treated feel more individualized. Because of this, the world feels more like a big soup of sameness, even when some parts of the soup dress or speak differently. It\u2019s weird and conflicts with ostensible themes like isolation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e62459b-0ae2-4817-ba20-300097e91ef5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e62459b-0ae2-4817-ba20-300097e91ef5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2cde619-17b8-4d8d-8a02-aca00ac45809", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1b1ac13975dfec9cd3d134e74278d720026822f62bf05a4cbb444f877d4cef4"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b010808-7a62-4ecd-bf06-12610b52d3dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6fa60295c6b7ef4181f65c9b7eb763a8da27e21b6862591fe463eff176ab719"}}, "hash": "6bf47abba20cf7ac6e9211f314513a55239f3bf36b627a4e1144a0b3b845436d", "text": "It\u2019s weird and conflicts with ostensible themes like isolation. It makes the whole diversity thing hard to comment on, too, since nothing on that level feels thoughtful one way or the other.In terms of the bigger picture, you end up with Clive somewhat bouncing back and forth between his personal motivations, the Big Bad\u2019s creeping influence, and a more confused-feeling story that\u2019s like a hybrid of medieval slavery/class uprising and the X-Men. The former is more polished and compelling than the latter, and the ways the two intersect can be awkward. Overall I believe Final Fantasy 16 is interested in exploring various ways a callous, dehumanizing ruling class inherently sets itself up for failure. But it tries to explore those various ways all at once, fumbling a few along the way.Final Fantasy 16 also struggles at times with its supporting characters. I noted before the strong performances and characters that do a great job reinforcing Clive\u2019s story. At the same time, that focus on Clive does come at the expense of everyone else. Especially when the \u201ceveryone else\u201d is a woman. Jill\u2019s presence in the story especially falls short compared to others like Cid or Dion, who are more consistently active agents in the story. Jill often just feels present for the sake of having a female lead to check off a box, which is a bummer because when she\u2019s the actual focus her contributions to the story are notably strong.\u00a0At the end of the day though, little of Final Fantasy 16 is as strong as its combat. Square Enix knocked it out of the park with this one. Experimenting with RPG-heavy action systems has been a long tradition in Final Fantasy. Under Capcom alum and combat director Ryota Suzuki, the action feels developed well past the experimental phase. You\u2019d be forgiven for expecting something closely resembling Devil May Cry, but that\u2019s not at all what was delivered. There are familiar verbs and functions, but the tools and applications are distinct and feel right at home in Final Fantasy.At the heart of Final Fantasy 16\u2019s gameplay is creativity. Players get access to a bag of tools that broadens in scale and sophistication as the game progresses. Clive\u2019s own abilities are expanded upon with Eikons, the traditional \u201cSummons\u201d in Final Fantasy parlance that have a whole new kind of presence here. Now we\u2019re looking at an almost Mega Man-like structure that lets you equip each Eikon as its own small pool of skills. As you invest more time and resources into mixing and matching your skills, the complexity of the process increases. This results in an endgame toy box that has intentional limits to encourage experimentation with builds.The possibilities feel just a hair short of limitless, and there\u2019s a sense of playfulness with familiar concepts for fans of Character Action games that will no doubt get those creative juices flowing. For example, there\u2019s no static \u201clauncher\u201d button but myriad routes to starting and maintaining air combos. But you can also ignore air combat entirely if you want, and what feels like a billion options in between. My favorite Eikon felt like having a \u201cStand\u201d as if Clive was taking a page from JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. It\u2019s good stuff, y\u2019all.Eikons aren\u2019t just for equipping cooldown skills. They\u2019re also focal points of the story, absurdly powerful forces that are just as important for political machinations as they are putting giant craters in the ground. This is reflected in showcase moments in the gameplay as well, as climactic battles will transition from the on the ground combo clashes to beyond over the top, genre-tearing blowouts that rip off the limiters in every way possible. These moments are when convention is tossed aside, and composer Masayoshi Soken gets to unleash his playful side alongside everyone else. We\u2019re talking quick time events, ridiculous setpieces, and unique mechanics (I swear to God that Sonic the Hedgehog is invoked at one glorious point), super robot anime tropes, and more. These moments, in particular, made me feel ashamed of my words and deeds for ever being concerned about the Game of Thrones inspiration.Combat sickos will be eating good with Final Fantasy 16, well after the credits run. There are multiple difficulty options and a truly impressive New Game Plus offering on the table, but there\u2019s a whole score-attacking leaderboard-filling arcade mode structure as well. You can replay chunks of the game roped off into \u201cstages,\u201d both with all your gear and levels intact as well as more rigidly-defined stats with even more bespoke difficulty options.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b010808-7a62-4ecd-bf06-12610b52d3dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b010808-7a62-4ecd-bf06-12610b52d3dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e62459b-0ae2-4817-ba20-300097e91ef5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6bf47abba20cf7ac6e9211f314513a55239f3bf36b627a4e1144a0b3b845436d"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d16b481-0e86-4cbb-9afa-34f2e80c0e9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "40f6d1eaaabc85578d2e55497e36b3c34858ef8b930be669b774c356f51f3f90"}}, "hash": "e6fa60295c6b7ef4181f65c9b7eb763a8da27e21b6862591fe463eff176ab719", "text": "I wish some of the other parts of Final Fantasy 16 were cooked as well as the combat, because damn!Some of the other systems feel way underbaked in comparison.

There\u2019s a crafting system, but the stat progression is oddly linear, especially considering how much junk material is constantly thrown at you. Supporting characters also get to participate in combat as \u201cparty members,\u201d but despite being represented as cute sprites in the save UI and visibly using skills, their inclusion feels shallow at best. Torgal (the dog, not to be confused with the weird little frog guy Turgle in Star Wars) is another story.

Obviously, having control over multiple characters would be too much, but something more meaningful than lip service would\u2019ve been nice.Final Fantasy 16 is a massive game that, in many ways, feels like a response to years of rocky terrain. This is one of the most beloved series in gaming, but one that has had big ups and downs, especially in recent memory. That\u2019s not to suggest Final Fantasy 16 doesn\u2019t have problems (and, for the record, I loved 15), but what it does have in spades is polish. It\u2019s a nebulous term I don\u2019t like to use, but feels distinctly apt here. Final Fantasy 16 has a sense of completeness; this is a game that feels finished from conception to release. For all its flaws and flourishes, this game stands like an anomaly in the world of AAA video games, in that all its bones are in place for us all to devour and digest, like a blockbuster movie or hardcover novel. I\u2019m not waiting for a patch or contemplating possible DLC, or wondering what was missing or left on the cutting room floor in desperation to meet deadlines. Instead, I\u2019ve let a story wash over me like a tidal wave, and the only thing I\u2019m looking for after is seeing what everyone else has to say. That\u2019s exactly what I want from Final Fantasy.This review was based on a PlayStation 5 code provided by the publisher.

Yes, with an 'if'. No, with a 'but'.Final Fantasy 16 is basically two games in one. First of all, you have an excellent, best-in-class 20-hour action game with a truly brilliant story. Bolted to it, however, you have a deeply flawed role-playing game \u2013 which makes up the other 25 hours of the experience.\r\nThis is the tale of FF16; when it\u2019s excellent, it is truly, unbelievably, earth-shatteringly good. When it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s mildly frustrating at best, and pretty wretched at its worst.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d16b481-0e86-4cbb-9afa-34f2e80c0e9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d16b481-0e86-4cbb-9afa-34f2e80c0e9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b010808-7a62-4ecd-bf06-12610b52d3dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6fa60295c6b7ef4181f65c9b7eb763a8da27e21b6862591fe463eff176ab719"}, "3": {"node_id": "44c3b07e-ef55-4d72-9eea-ac89bdb1b405", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "683a43a42cb5d28593c6c8126ede34f88c85266637f10756ed1f8d1b4605be7f"}}, "hash": "40f6d1eaaabc85578d2e55497e36b3c34858ef8b930be669b774c356f51f3f90", "text": "On balance, the good outweighs the bad to an enormous degree, and so it\u2019s a game that\u2019s incredibly easy to recommend in spite of its shortcomings. It\u2019s also the best entry point and jumping-on point for Final Fantasy newcomers in decades.\r\nLet\u2019s start with the good, because I do think that\u2019s what\u2019ll stay with you once the credits roll. Final Fantasy 16 presents one of the most accomplished and well-rounded stories in the series. In narrative terms, this tale now sits up there with numbers 6, 7, 9 and 10 in terms of its execution and my overall satisfaction. How Final Fantasy is it? Well, plenty, I think \u2013 though not so much early on. In fact, in its earliest stages, FF16 feels like it deliberately shies away from and treats its legacy with the subtlest of cold shoulders. Instead, it\u2019s interested in a grittier sort of world building, one clearly inspired by Western works like God of War and, yes, Game of Thrones. The Thrones influence can be felt everywhere, from the more grounded world to the way characters act \u2013 and in a bunch of series alumni who show up in voice acting roles. Grounded is a good word to sum up the game in general. It\u2019s often expressed in the little things; characters don\u2019t just sit around in their heroic outfits, but have bedclothes, or make appearances wearing nothing at all. It cuts a sharp contrast to FF7 Remake, where everyone cuts about in pristine \u2018hero outfits\u2019 at all times. For most of the game, the exposition-heavy monologues that are something of a series staple are left to the side. It\u2019s belt-and-braces, workmanlike. If you want the detailed lore, there\u2019s a codex you can open to dig into that. This is a world quite unlike any other Final Fantasy. People have drawn lines of connection to FF12 and Tactics, two games which share a great number of development staff with 16 \u2013 but make no mistake, this is something new. There\u2019s the combat, which we\u2019ll come to, but Final Fantasy games have often swapped out systems and mechanics. So that element isn\u2019t a departure. What\u2019s new here is a difference in tone. Final Fantasy has been medieval, relatively modern, and dabbled in punks, both cyber- and steam-. But it\u2019s never been quite like this. In the first couple of hours, which many of you will have experienced in the demo, there\u2019s more cursing and on-screen throat slitting than in practically the entire rest of the series put together. There are no pleasant deaths. People die soaked in blood, their eyes locked open in terror. People are strung up, mutilated, and abused. Some slit their own throats rather than face their fates. There are fairly extensive references to sexual assault. Characters we like and sympathize with execute their enemies, even unarmed, without a second thought.Sometimes it feels a little rote, like when the initial party of revolutionaries hold a planning meeting in a brothel, their strategizing interrupted by moans of pleasure from next door. But generally speaking it all works \u2013 it\u2019s an unpleasant world, but one I was nevertheless happy to be adventuring in. It\u2019s a departure I welcome, and in tried and true FF fashion it manages to feel fresh while obviously lifting from some other popular works.The greatest part of why it all works can be placed on two groups of people: first, all those involved in crafting the character models and facial animation. FF16 unfortunately has that classic split between truly curated cutscenes and more basic scenes, so there\u2019s probably a 50/50 split between hand-directed cinematic moments and those with static blocking and basic lip-flap. But all of the stuff that is artistically directed is sublimely so - utterly convincing and entertaining in its delivery.Second, there\u2019s the group of people responsible for the other half of that - a brilliant voice cast, and all of those who translated, wrote, ad-libbed, and otherwise helped to deliver this narrative. These guys are the absolute MVPs of this game, and in doing so they create some aspects of this game that will dominate Final Fantasy \u2018best of\u2019 lists - the best Cid, the best romantic subplot, some of the best cutscenes, and even a protagonist who will probably henceforth prop up quite a few best lead lists.It\u2019s not all precisely perfect, mind. The game\u2019s best female character is written out of the action towards the end in a way that feels like a huge cop-out.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44c3b07e-ef55-4d72-9eea-ac89bdb1b405": {"__data__": {"id_": "44c3b07e-ef55-4d72-9eea-ac89bdb1b405", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "5d16b481-0e86-4cbb-9afa-34f2e80c0e9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "40f6d1eaaabc85578d2e55497e36b3c34858ef8b930be669b774c356f51f3f90"}, "3": {"node_id": "bcdbc0c3-88e5-424e-b9a8-3233b9322111", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f8c2b4dd63335db3f9445d3a72dd3ee8de4b1ea6e79fcbdf7e39ee999e2e421"}}, "hash": "683a43a42cb5d28593c6c8126ede34f88c85266637f10756ed1f8d1b4605be7f", "text": "One of the key villains, Clive\u2019s mother, is one-note and goes nowhere. And surprisingly, the core cast of \u2018Dominants\u2019 that have heavily been promoted actually aren\u2019t the game\u2019s best. Many are under-served, in fact. More minor characters pre-release materials have barely referred to such as Gav, Byron, and Mid are better-developed than the likes of Barnabas (Odin), Hugo (Titan), and Benedikta (Garuda). But even in the case of these lesser-developed characters, excellent performances carry them. Hugo has barely anything to do, but has a verbal sparring match with Clive before battle that is among the best exchanges in the game, which flexes its graphical prowess with some brilliantly subtle facial animation as the two men seethe with fury.The story works, then. So too does the combat, which takes cues from \u2018character action\u2019 games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta rather than your typical RPG fodder. You\u2019ll control only protagonist Clive, but for a few brief exceptions - and it\u2019s an entirely action-oriented affair. Hiring people who have been experts on this type of combat is a work of genius, for it isn\u2019t just an imitation - it\u2019s one of the finest examples of this sort of combat, lifting abilities and iconography from Final Fantasy at large to provide the most flashy pieces of combat, the powerful Eikonic Abilities.When you\u2019re in full-flow and the combat is firing on all cylinders, FF16 is fabulously engaging and exciting. I can understand why its combat director, a Capcom and DMC veteran, calls the game his masterpiece. But it\u2019s also a system that is sadly undermined by other elements of the game. And it\u2019s here where Final Fantasy 16 begins to struggle.In many ways, it\u2019s a game built around compromises. Fans expect Final Fantasy to have party members - so FF16 has party members. As a pleasant surprise, there\u2019s a larger rotating cast of heroes joining Clive throughout his adventure than has been let on. But it\u2019s easy to have lots of party members when they\u2019re largely useless in battle; they toss out a few weak attacks here and there, and later in the game will cast some half-decent spells. But make no mistake that there\u2019s no team-up attacks, and no tangible feeling that you\u2019re fighting alongside anyone. They\u2019re there for aesthetic and story reasons only.Torgal, Clive\u2019s faithful hound, is more useful in battle. But the pup has no RPG progression, and aside from one story development that bequeaths him a power that seemingly triggers at random, he doesn\u2019t grow across the game\u2019s 45 hours. Then again, that shouldn\u2019t be surprising: Clive himself has relatively few powers to unlock. The act of \u2018attuning\u2019 Eikons and obtaining their powers, which expands his potential skill pool, is poorly paced. A \u2018full deck\u2019 of equipped skills involves three Eikons, which you won\u2019t have until a good 20-25 hours into the game. Further unlocks come every five to seven hours. \r\nProgression feels slow, and then even when it comes you\u2019re fairly limited in what you can equip. Clive can have three Eikons, making for six skills (plus three Eikonic abilities), and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s so few that you\u2019ll likely end up sitting on thousands of unspent Skill Points once you find a build you like, as there\u2019s no point upgrading skills that aren\u2019t usable. You can swap them in and out and even mix-and-match Eikons and skills as you get deeper into the game \u2013 but in an RPG sense, it feels quite shallow. But this isn\u2019t a pure action game. It is an action RPG. And this is where the troubles lie. For an action game, like a Devil May Cry, it\u2019d be just fine. But DMC5 is about 12-15 hours long; FF16 is three times that length. No matter how good the combat looks and feels \u2013 and it\u2019s bloody magnificent \u2013 it\u2019ll inevitably wear thin without strong progression across a 40+ hour run-time. And this sort of issue feels to bleed across every RPG element of the game. Crafting is present, for instance, via an NPC at your home base. But the flow of new weapons and gear is a tiny trickle, and I ended the game with thousands of unused crafting materials, because there\u2019s little to craft.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bcdbc0c3-88e5-424e-b9a8-3233b9322111": {"__data__": {"id_": "bcdbc0c3-88e5-424e-b9a8-3233b9322111", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "44c3b07e-ef55-4d72-9eea-ac89bdb1b405", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "683a43a42cb5d28593c6c8126ede34f88c85266637f10756ed1f8d1b4605be7f"}, "3": {"node_id": "b403b3fd-326a-4d54-84f6-8fcc6f936b5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ee02c71ccda4c7ba60af5ce82efaf412b549a7a072e48b69f1296f1b6428634"}}, "hash": "7f8c2b4dd63335db3f9445d3a72dd3ee8de4b1ea6e79fcbdf7e39ee999e2e421", "text": "I also ended up with hundreds of thousands of Gil \u2013 FF\u2019s currency \u2013 because unless you plan to collect music for a Jukebox in your base at 20k-50k a time, there\u2019s absolutely bloody nothing to spend it on.Side quests are plentiful, but actual high quality ones are few and far between. Quests with decent rewards are marked with a separate icon, dividing side content into two \u2018tiers\u2019 just like in FF14 - but those decent rewards are basically only upgrades to the potency and stock of your potions (which are limited, Souls-style), three new Blacksmithing recipes, and unlocking your Chocobo. This isn\u2019t a game for loot goblins in general, really - I can count the number of times I got something useful from a chest in nearly 50 hours on my fingers. Usually it\u2019s just more crafting materials - which, as previously mentioned, are useless. Like, wow - I trekked out of my way for this chest and it\u2019s another 20 Sharp Fangs! Great! I\u2019ll put them in the pile with the other 1400. Even the story, excellent though it is, isn\u2019t safe from this chaff. FF16 has an awful habit of following up one of its incredible Eikon battle set pieces \u2013 which are genuinely hair-raisingly brilliant \u2013 with absolutely naff compulsory fetch quests. The worst of these often involve talking to a series of NPCs in succession who are placed at opposite ends of your base, The Hideaway. You can\u2019t sprint in the Hideaway, and crossing from one end to the other takes about a minute. This feels like a pathetic thing to complain about, but when you\u2019re criss-crossing for like the tenth time, it really begins to grate. Other times, you\u2019ll be trekking back to areas of the world you\u2019ve been to before in order to fight enemies you\u2019ve fought before to pick up some trinket or another. This is classic RPG stuff, obviously, but something about how the compulsory versions of these quests are placed and paced screams padding. It seems to admit as much later on, too \u2013 where late game quests drop the charade of walking here and there and begin to automatically teleport you to key locations. Almost like the developers are saying: \u2018alright, we\u2019re almost at the end now, we\u2019ll quit wasting your time\u2019. The problem, to be clear, isn\u2019t that FF16 isn\u2019t \u2018enough\u2019 of an RPG. It also wouldn\u2019t be a problem if FF16 flat-out wasn\u2019t a role-playing game. The issue is when RPG mechanics have been integrated in a way that is unsatisfactory and, honestly, in a way that often just undermines the solid story-driven action adventure at FF16\u2019s heart. I was truly gutted to realize this, because the first impression is so strong, the combat so tight, and the character-driven narrative so fiercely gripping that I thought this might be up there for me with FF6, 7, and 9. But then the bloat sets in, and you begin to brush up against the padding.\r\nSometimes, it feels like insecurity and worry about FF\u2019s legacy and its existing RPG fan base have driven certain decisions. This adventure is split into two sorts of levels \u2013 linear action stages and four semi-open zones. This works really well, and is a strong template for FF\u2019s future, and to some extent most closely resembles FF12. \r\nBut the open zones inexplicably lack a mini map or compass, a baffling choice considering Hunts give you vague directions such as \u201cNorth of Martha\u2019s Rest\u201d. The only way to determine 'north' is to repeatedly open the full-screen map. I\u2019m convinced this decision was made over worries that a mini-map would expose these areas as not really \u2018open world\u2019, but as a series of relatively linear connected corridors. But, honestly \u2013 who gives a shit? Give me a damn mini map!\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of stuff like this. I wish the game had a single memorable town (it doesn\u2019t; the great big population centers you see in trailers are only ever visited in linear action stages, when they\u2019re on fire, under siege, or in ruin). I wish Clive could effectively equip more than six skills, as it\u2019d really make upgrading skills more worthwhile. I wish it either had less of this RPG content, or that the RPG stuff was better. Because, honestly, the rest is pretty fantastic.\r\nThat\u2019s the thing.

This is a truly great video game. It\u2019s a towering achievement in its own way. So, to be fair, was Final Fantasy 15. And in a way, these two make a strange little duology; FF15 a game that is somehow more than the sum of its broken, slightly rubbish parts, and FF16 a game that is routinely brilliant but (due to some strange decisions undermines that brilliance) is a little less than the sum of its parts. \r\nTo be clear, FF16 is the better game of the two \u2013 and I\u2019d say it\u2019s clearly the best numbered single-player Final Fantasy since the PS2 era. \r\nFor series fans, FF16 will inevitably provoke debate. I expect it to be both beloved and reviled. The discourse will be unbearable. That\u2019s how you can tell it\u2019s a good Final Fantasy, by the way. For newcomers, this presents a different, thoroughly modern Final Fantasy: full of wonder, and joy, and flaws in a way that feels most appropriate to the rest of the series. \r\nRelatively early on in Final Fantasy 16, our first party of adventurers make a pact. They agree that the only way forward for the world \u2013 if people accept it or not \u2013 is to destroy the crystals that loom large over the land and have defined its destiny for eons. Cid and Clive drive daggers into a small piece of crystal to signify that vow. In a way, that is this game: the crystals are representative of the history and traditions of FF, and whether fans like it or not, some of those traditions have to be desecrated and destroyed.But it\u2019s not that simple. It never is. In FF16, Clive, Cid, and the others ultimately derive their power from the same mysterious origins as the crystals themselves. To complete their objective, they need the very thing they seek to destroy. And so too does FF16 need that history, those traditions, leveraging some even as it drives a dagger through others. That is the duality of the game. A dichotomy at the heart of its structure, its triumphs, and its failures alike.

It seldom happens when a game comes out and blows you away for a multitude of reasons, yet the sixteenth entry in Square Enix\u2019s long-running series manages to do so in almost every way imaginable. Whether it was the frantic and layered combat, the photo-realistic environments and delicious character animations, the engrossing and, frankly, epic story, or the sheer range of content available to you, FFXVI is a masterpiece in every way.There\u2019s such a rich lore that runs throughout Final Fantasy 16. You are enamoured by the past and the present, and Clive\u2019s own tale is more than enough of a reason to keep on playing, however, he is only a drop in the ocean of Square Enix\u2019s George R.R. Martin-esque world. To understand what is at stake, you\u2019re given constant details to everything that surrounds you, from the six realms within the land of Valisthea to the large cast of characters, to the implications of their actions and those who are capable of wielding the magic of the Mothercrystals.It\u2019s staggering how much there is to take in, whether through the easily accessible lore at your hideaway or the Active Time Lore feature that lets you check out key information during cutscenes. I\u2019ll try and do it justice and give you a rough outline, but playing is the only way to appreciate how good this vast and expansive story really is. The Mothercrystals are great sources of magick and have blessed the people for years, yet the Blight has begun to take hold on the land, sending realms to war against each other, striking fear into people\u2019s hearts at the thought of the aether no longer being there to offer comfort and peace.You play as Clive, the First Shield of Rosaria and protector to Joshua, your brother and Dominant to the Eikon of fire known as Phoenix.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4269c43f-7580-4ab7-8c9d-26e26530bbb8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4269c43f-7580-4ab7-8c9d-26e26530bbb8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a37b04b-7769-4754-a4eb-f2b06528572f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c16c44271dbee45f91571246aaaa606e2b77c1df38cfc9687be8613e210e4cb5"}, "3": {"node_id": "a00e4185-654b-4b14-91a1-919b01ae0f70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf8bc125d3668cfa1ebf2e6ab61e5289096cc16e722bd0647fe169b5b09933fc"}}, "hash": "462393ae28969325a83a668d70e8a240fce93728b4d8652863028e668b307a46", "text": "After a tragedy befalls you and the blight begins to spread further, you and your friends make a choice that will affect the land forever. These Eikon\u2019s are huge creatures that are attuned to the natural elements, and Dominants are those who are home to these powerful beings. Rarely do they wage war against each other, but with what is at stake, it\u2019s becoming more and more frequent as the realms are in a constant state of war.There are so many twists and turns that you\u2019re always on the edge of your seat, and the inspiration taken from Game of Thrones is obvious. Not just in the story, but in how no-one is safe. Countless times when I started to like someone, they met a brutal death. It\u2019s wonderfully written, and the characters are all brought to life by the hard work of the actors. There are certainly more northerners in FFXVI than Game of Thrones, once more showing the effect the books and the show have had on the developers. It\u2019s by no means a negative, as the familiar Final Fantasy tropes start to appear, especially when it comes to the gargantuan Eikons.I could gush over the story for another four or five paragraphs because it is so good. I was enraptured by Clive and the nuances of his performance, suddenly flipped on its head by overwhelming emotion during pivotal scenes, or Jill\u2019s sweet and humble shell, cracking as you find out about how she was treated when she wasn\u2019t in the company of Clive. There are layers to everyone, and even the enemies are fascinating, especially that of Kupka. Oh, and Cidolfus is a god-damn hero of mine, period.As you play through the story and start to encounter new Dominants, Clive learns new abilities that can help you in multiple ways when slaying soldiers, monsters, and other various enemies. These Eikon attacks can be switched quickly in combat, with each one having a cooldown before using again. By progressing, you\u2019ll naturally start to learn all the combinations that work for you, and while you may think you\u2019ve got a rather hefty arsenal of magic to choose from, Final Fantasy 16 keeps throwing new elemental abilities at you. There\u2019s an ability tree which makes all of your skills more effective, along with the option to unlock new ones that are more powerful. You can also reset any spent ability points in case you want to try another approach out.These Eikon attacks can launch waves of flames at enemies, send lightening bolts at direct targets, or fire a flurry of punches at enemies by harnessing the power of Garuda, a wind-type Eikon. There are loads of skills available, along with other abilities via Eikons that help you get closer to targets, pull them towards you, summon a large rock shield, and more. One of the big features of battle is staggering, allowing you to break a tougher enemy\u2019s Will Gauge or boss which renders them helpless for a short while. Not only does it stop them in their tracks, it also lets you dish out punishment without interruption from them.Then there\u2019s the Limit Break Gauge, a powerful ability that, when pressing the two analogue sticks together, unleashes a flurry of fire attacks in quick succession. Clive is imbued with variety in how you approach every battle, and it never becomes too complex or overwhelming thanks to how every attack and concept seems to work together in order to get the most effective results. You can also parry, and dodging at the right time allows you to return a strike without being blocked. There are many layers to combat and there\u2019s never a dull moment as far as battles are concerned, with constant improvements and additions help to keep fights exciting.Throughout Final Fantasy 16, your party might change from time to time, with each member having their own range of abilities. You\u2019ve also got your trusty hound, Torgal, that is there to help dish out attacks whenever entering combat. He\u2019s the Ghost to your Jon Snow, ever reliable and trusting, never afraid to get stuck in the throes of battle. Equipment can be picked up from bigger battles along with resources to reinforce armour and weapons at blacksmiths, and there is a range of enchanted gear from necklaces to rings that can be equipped to give you specific bonuses which affect the difficulty of the game.While FFXVI doesn\u2019t exactly let you choose between easy, normal, and hard, these items of jewellery affect the game massively. One will allow you to pull off all of your moves off by hammering Square, although you can also choose them in tandem, even if it becomes a little awkward when doing so.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a00e4185-654b-4b14-91a1-919b01ae0f70": {"__data__": {"id_": "a00e4185-654b-4b14-91a1-919b01ae0f70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "4269c43f-7580-4ab7-8c9d-26e26530bbb8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "462393ae28969325a83a668d70e8a240fce93728b4d8652863028e668b307a46"}, "3": {"node_id": "745b75ca-9f1e-4569-9187-19c684630ff6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed4a9678e160aef4e4d23cfc5dd6882a9aa61624caef8d30061c16ec940c63c0"}}, "hash": "bf8bc125d3668cfa1ebf2e6ab61e5289096cc16e722bd0647fe169b5b09933fc", "text": "Another replenishes health, or makes Torgal attack without you needing to do a thing. There\u2019s a wealth of gear and I love how you can chop and change them to suit your playstyle. I\u2019ll forever be in debt to the one that highlighted an enemy attack which allowed me to dodge because, as incredible as the visuals are during a fight soaked in magic, it can be almost impossible to see where enemies are at times.Throughout the campaign, you\u2019ll gain access to various merchants in Valisthea who\u2019ll sell you potions, tonics to allow temporary buffs to attack and defence, music tracks that can be selected at your hideaway\u2019s tavern, and resources needed for certain upgrades. The bulk of your time between missions will be spent at your hideaway, and as the story progresses, new things get added to it such as Monster Hunts (essentially Witcher Contracts) ran by a Moogle; an encyclopaedia featuring all the characters you meet, and information about the ongoing war, and all other important information to make up a stunning visual glossary of your travels; a renown system whereby you\u2019re rewarded in resources for your hard work; a blacksmith where your armour and weapons can be improved; a bedroom to read letters from your friends and acquaintances; a training room to brush up on skills and replay missions, and other various outlets.Nothing feels arbitrary and everything has its place. You become fond of Charon\u2019s surly nature and Gav\u2019s positivity. You get excited to return in case of a new mission to expand your knowledge, skills, or benefits. It feels like a home, and that\u2019s something Clive so desperately needs as he risks his life to help those in need. He\u2019s been through so much and has spent so long torturing himself, yet his penchant for helping other branded (those with natural magical abilities) individuals remains at the forefront of everything he does. Touching on the story once more, the way branded are treated depending on where they reside is another fascinating part of the story. Some are heralded as lords while others are treated worse than dogs, adding even more layers to FFXVI\u2019s overarching narrative.Both the story and the world of Final Fantasy 16 is brought to life by the phenomenal graphics. Each realm you visit and the areas within are remarkable, impeccably designed and life-like, blurring the lines between computer animation and realism. The way characters move and act outside of cinematics are phenomenal, especially in some of the bigger set pieces. In a majority of the big boss fights, Clive channels his Eikon, and you\u2019ll end up fighting other Eikon\u2019s throughout the story, the intricacies of these fights are detailed to the last pixel. They left me floored every time, and when you\u2019re watching cutscenes, there\u2019s nothing else like it. FFXVI is perhaps the nicest looking game I\u2019ve ever played.These cinematics play out throughout the game, and there\u2019re are a lot, however, you never feel like they outstay their welcome, and they do a fantastic job of fleshing out the story. Some of these scenes are highly emotional, and I didn\u2019t realise how connected I was to certain characters until I felt the warmth of a tear on my cheek. This world, beautifully crafted by Square Enix, is filled with wonder, passion, beauty, and pain, and throughout it all, the art of it left me amazed. Each town has its own personality, whether you\u2019re at Martha\u2019s Keep, Lostwing, or Eastpool. You see different economies and politics affect the flow of things. You\u2019ll agree and disagree with a range of characters and how they act, yet you\u2019ll appreciate how the scope of war has affected this world.While not quite open world, you\u2019ll be able to fast travel via Obelisks located around Valisthea. Each area has a local map with various side quests to complete, chests to find, and other points of interest. The running mechanic is a little unreliable, and a small issue is not having the ability to press something to start sprinting. This is ironed out later on with the inclusion of mounts, specifically the chocobo, a Final Fantasy stalwart. Ladders, blockades, and chasms are automatically traversed by walking up to them, which takes away the need to press buttons as well, further emphasising the focus on FFXVI\u2019s story. Each biome, whether a desert, forest, or volcano, is fascinating to explore and beautiful to look at, making every location a sight to behold.Final Fantasy 16 is gigantic and ambitious, but rarely puts a foot wrong.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "745b75ca-9f1e-4569-9187-19c684630ff6": {"__data__": {"id_": "745b75ca-9f1e-4569-9187-19c684630ff6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "a00e4185-654b-4b14-91a1-919b01ae0f70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf8bc125d3668cfa1ebf2e6ab61e5289096cc16e722bd0647fe169b5b09933fc"}, "3": {"node_id": "68c7d68b-3596-4e8f-b7df-d3557c3056ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef68b08ba7d019dd533db008f6c176051d702ef3157fe84662609893895c3a8a"}}, "hash": "ed4a9678e160aef4e4d23cfc5dd6882a9aa61624caef8d30061c16ec940c63c0", "text": "Its story consistently moves and amuses you, with a wealth of interesting characters to befriend and mourn.

Reviews, videos, podcast, news: we\u2019ve got the lot: PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox, PC Gaming!\nAttack of the Fanboy, In the 90s, Squaresoft brought together some of the industry\u2019s most talented individuals to create a \u201cdream team\u201d with the goal of creating one of the greatest RPGs of all time. That development team included all-stars like Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii, and Dragon Ball author and character designer Akira Toriyama among others. This meeting of minds gave rise to Chrono Trigger, one of the best games of its generation and one of the most celebrated games of all time. Now, Square Enix finds itself in a similar situation with Final Fantasy XVI. Producer Naoki Yoshida has even referred to XVI\u2019s development team as a dream team himself in pre-release interviews, and they\u2019ve got the credentials to back it up. Of course, Yoshida helms the critically-acclaimed MMO Final Fantasy XIV and plenty of those MMO devs have followed him into XVI\u2019s development, but there are also the likes of Ryota Suzuki, the game\u2019s combat director who worked on Devil May Cry 5, Dragon\u2019s Dogma, and Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and Masayoshi Soken, one of the industry\u2019s most beloved composers who continually churns out bangers for Final Fantasy XIV.If you look at any of the names attached to Final Fantasy XVI, you\u2019ll notice a history of exceptional work. That talent bleeds into every aspect of this game. As many of you already know from the game\u2019s recently released demo, Final Fantasy XVI fires on all cylinders right out of the gate. As exciting as the demo is, however, things only ramp up from there. Final Fantasy XVI is an exhilarating adventure packed with plenty of pretty particle effects and larger-than-life Eikon battles interspersed between quiet, human moments of heartbreak, hatred, and most importantly of all, hope. Final Fantasy XVI is set in Valisthea, a dark fantasy world comprised of twin continents that rely on Mothercrystals as the backbone of society. These Mothercrystals, and smaller handheld crystals owned by commoners and elites alike, allow people to cast magic to aid with daily tasks like refilling wells, chilling food, and heating baths. There are some with the ability to cast magic without a crystal, but these people are immediately branded and forced into slavery as Bearers. In addition, a select chosen few are Dominants, powerful individuals with the ability to call upon the power of an Eikon.Bearers, named for the Crystal\u2019s Curse that they bear which slowly turns their bodies to stone as they continue to cast magic, are seen as subhuman in each of Valisthea\u2019s kingdoms. It\u2019s these Bearers that are the backbone of Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s story, as protagonist Clive Rosfield finds himself embroiled in an underground rebellion amid his personal quest for revenge. XVI\u2019s story continually puts new twists on its rules as Clive and his companions travel the Twins, and learning the intricacies of the relationships between Bearers, the Mothercrystals, Dominants, commoners, and the elite in each kingdom keeps the story interesting throughout its lengthy runtime.XVI wrestles with the very real consequences of revolution, forcing its cast to confront the suffering that always precedes salvation. A major running theme throughout the game is that things will get worse before they get better.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68c7d68b-3596-4e8f-b7df-d3557c3056ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "68c7d68b-3596-4e8f-b7df-d3557c3056ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b01e65a4-7ff9-4613-b854-4fff3aa9d7d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67d239c98e8c7a9e579c4b449b9d8eb7bb0aaf77008619e001a24e8ed3d50c70"}, "2": {"node_id": "745b75ca-9f1e-4569-9187-19c684630ff6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed4a9678e160aef4e4d23cfc5dd6882a9aa61624caef8d30061c16ec940c63c0"}, "3": {"node_id": "e9f1915b-43ca-4db4-b5db-82598bc0b9ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "14a3c01c3e19ca5964d6de18b020f93c0f33e62be2b210659adc320ef37ed37d"}}, "hash": "ef68b08ba7d019dd533db008f6c176051d702ef3157fe84662609893895c3a8a", "text": "A major running theme throughout the game is that things will get worse before they get better.

The main story does a fine enough job, but really getting to know the people of Valisthea and their cultures will greatly enhance your experience with the game. Basically every optional quest in the game functions as a new lens of examination for Clive\u2019s goals and morals. Pretty much every \u201cwell actually\u201d thought that could be raised by an overly pedantic Redditor is answered in a side quest at some point.Each of XVI\u2019s quests is filled with smart writing that explores avenues of oppression that aren\u2019t as obvious on the surface level but still hurt just as hard. One may be compelled to turn down their dream job to help with their sibling\u2019s underground Bearer liberation efforts, for example, or a doctor may find themselves wracked with guilt over lost patients even if they\u2019re doing everything they can. Loss extends beyond just dead people in Valisthea.In addition, there are multiple side quest chains that progress alongside the main story, giving you updates on growing settlements and storylines that are central to Clive\u2019s cause. The rewards for these might be lackluster if you\u2019re only looking at the Gil and XP, but the lore and worldbuilding are the real rewards. Watching a settlement of newly-freed Bearers struggle to find their way, for example, is incredibly compelling. Some of them can\u2019t even comprehend what having a home means, let alone be motivated to take up arms to defend it from monsters. Still, despite its dark tone and overt Game of Thrones influence, Final Fantasy XVI is ultimately a hopeful tale. Clive\u2019s group toils for the future of those yet to come, and XVI\u2019s story goes to great lengths to show the importance of that. It\u2019s a story about solidarity, about joining arms and standing side by side with your companions even if there\u2019s only a 1% chance of a better future sometime down the line. In XVI\u2019s eyes, complacency is cowardice.It\u2019s an incredibly important story for our day and age as we find ourselves feeling powerless and smothered by an oppressive atmosphere. When most are too apathetic about their situation to strive for change, and those that do have the will to invoke change are too worried about putting food on the table or living paycheck to paycheck, how do we as a society advance the greater good? XVI asserts that our neighbors and friends are the wings on which we rise, but it also shows the reality that the power of friendship is not a magic bullet that cures all. It\u2019s a harsh path to take \u2014 and it\u2019s okay to be afraid or even angry at the hand you\u2019ve been dealt \u2014 but selfless sacrifice for those yet to come is the only way we can grow. Things may seem fated to remain this way, but our will is stronger. We only need to take the first steps to tread a path for the generations that follow.Again, the game\u2019s side quests are the most effective demonstration of the flickers of hope we can find in hopeless situations. Whether it\u2019s tending to the garden of a lost ally, finding a tasty treat for a furry friend, or gathering a group of friends to share a bottle of vintage wine, there are always brief snippets of happiness to be found throughout Valisthea. A world without little moments like this wouldn\u2019t be worth saving, after all.If it sounds like Final Fantasy XVI is a dense game, then you\u2019d be right. It demands your attention and requires you to learn the names of various kingdoms and characters, all while keeping track of manipulation and subterfuge that muddy the waters.

Active Time Lore is one of the game\u2019s breakthrough features, allowing you to press the touchpad at any time \u2014 even during cutscenes \u2014 to access a web of brief codex entries for every relevant character, location, or proper noun in that scene.It\u2019s much more than simply reading a long codex entry in another RPG too, since Active Time Lore usually only provides a paragraph or two maximum with the most relevant information that you need for that scene. Plus, the entries are updated with new information as you progress through the game, so as mysteries are uncovered, new refreshers will be added. It also keeps track of any ongoing mysteries or questions, so you\u2019ll be able to tell if you\u2019ve genuinely forgotten something or if you\u2019re not supposed to know an answer yet. In addition, there\u2019s a State of the Realm menu that can be accessed at the Hideaway, the game\u2019s main hub area. This shows an interactive timeline and map that showcases a web of every character relationship in the game, complete with helpful hints along the connective lines that read \u201cbrother,\u201d \u201csister,\u201d \u201cmanipulating,\u201d \u201cattempted assassination,\u201d and things like that. The map also changes as you progress along the timeline, allowing you to see borders grow and shrink throughout the story so you can keep tabs on each kingdom on the Twins.Active Time Lore and State of the Realm are genuinely two of Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s most impressive features because of their ease of use and continual updates throughout the story, and I hope to see more RPGs adopt something similar in the future. Imagine if you could watch a show like Game of Thrones for the first time all over again but still have all the knowledge you know now. That\u2019s what Active Time Lore brings to the table. It\u2019s like having a know-it-all friend on the couch next to you, only less annoying.Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s world and story deserve endless praise, but for the sake of this review, we\u2019re moving on to the game\u2019s other pillar: combat. While it may seem simple at first glance, Clive\u2019s powers create a remarkably deep combat system. Clive is armed with a basic sword attack and a ranged magic attack, but the two are meant to be alternated one after the other as your main combo string. On top of that, Clive can have up to three Eikons equipped at once, each with their own unique ability and two additional special attacks that operate on cooldowns. Stringing these together is the real meat of the combat, and choosing which Eikons to equip, when to use certain abilities, and leveling up abilities so you can use them with other active Eikons is where the bulk of build crafting takes place.Of course, the combat designer on this game also gave us Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon\u2019s Dogma, so you know there are fancy tricks that Clive can pull off during fights. Launching enemies into the air, using jump cancels to extend combos, and pulling off riskier parries in lieu of perfect dodges represent the tip of the iceberg with XVI\u2019s combat depth. Plus, there\u2019s Torgal, Clive\u2019s canine companion who serves as the only other directly controllable party member in the game. Clive can issue commands to Torgal during combat to extend his combos, and this powerful pup can launch enemies sky-high, extend combos both on the ground and in the air, and even slam foes down to the ground. There\u2019s a lot to keep track of during XVI\u2019s battles when you factor in Clive\u2019s rhythmic sword/magic combo, Eikon ability cooldowns, and Torgal commands, but the feeling you get when you start to master these systems is a high that few games can match.Simply put, Final Fantasy XVI has some of the best boss battles in any game ever. Final Fantasy is known for its scale and spectacle, but the PlayStation 5 breathes new life into these setpieces and makes them unbelievably gorgeous. The game somehow continues to top itself with each new boss battle, and most of these fights had my jaw on the floor and left me wondering how something like this is even playable. Soken\u2019s sweeping score is the cherry on top, decorating the blinding flashes of particle effects and epic scale with some of the most triumphant tracks I\u2019ve ever heard.XVI\u2019s normal combat already has an unbelievable amount of visual flair, but boss battles make use of QTEs and jaw-dropping phase transitions to really sell the spectacle.

The best of the bunch haven\u2019t been showcased yet though, and the game keeps coming up with creative new ways for these massive magical beasts to demonstrate their abilities.Unlike Devil May Cry, Clive isn\u2019t scored for stylish combos or fancy strings during the main game. However, there\u2019s something for all you DMC junkies out there: arcade mode. This side mode lets you replay any of the game\u2019s missions with fixed gear and a scoring system, giving you a reason to flex on those goblins and an outlet to scratch that Devil Trigger itch. If you really want to stretch this combat system as far as it can go, then arcade mode is for you.If you\u2019re looking for something to test your mettle, then you can start a playthrough on \u201cFinal Fantasy\u201d mode after completing the main campaign. It\u2019s technically New Game+, but it serves as Final Fantasy XVI\u2019s postgame. It basically ramps things up from the ending difficulty-wise but places you right at the beginning of the game (after the introduction, saving you a headache and letting you dive straight into the action). In a game where the level design and exploration aren\u2019t the primary focus, especially in the main campaign stages that you\u2019ll be replaying, adding new enemies and tougher bosses basically makes them brand-new levels. Yes, it\u2019s the same set of locales, but when most of them are basically just fancy corridors, the enemies are what make them unique. If you aren\u2019t typically a New Game+ enjoyer, you should still give Final Fantasy mode a chance.If you couldn\u2019t tell from the heaping amount of praise I\u2019ve been showering on it, Final Fantasy XVI is one of the best RPGs in a long time. It\u2019s easily the best non-MMO Final Fantasy (sorry, I\u2019m one of those XIV stans). It\u2019s ironic that a studio as plainly named as Creative Business Unit 3 is putting out some of the most creative, passionate, and heartfelt stuff in the industry at the moment.Final Fantasy XVI is an outstanding achievement. Every part of it, from its characters to its combat, was put there with a purpose. Not only does it deliver satisfyingly slick action RPG combat in between masterfully directed cutscenes, but also a story with real heart. Most importantly, it\u2019s incredibly clear that a team of creative individuals was behind every decision. There\u2019s a human element that permeates every aspect of Final Fantasy XVI, and that\u2019s what makes it so special.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.\n\nCurrently serving as an Associate Editor at Attack of the Fanboy, Diego Perez has been writing about video games since 2018, specializing in live service games like Destiny and Final Fantasy XIV.
