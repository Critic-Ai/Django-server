An online shooter set in a glittering futuristic vision of our solar system. \u00a0\nExpect to pay: $60 / \u00a350 \u00a0\nDeveloper: Bungie \u00a0\nPublisher: Activision \u00a0\nReviewed on: GTX 970, Intel Core i5-2500K 3.3GHZ, 16GB\nLink: Official siteWelcome to the era of the lifestyle game, where products are conceived, crafted and sold as persistent experiences intended to become a cornerstone of your leisure time. The brute force RPG treadmills of the monolithic noughties MMOs have given way to snackable games that use levels, loot boxes, card packs and incremental uneven rewards to entice us into putting in a few hours every week until the next game or expansion comes out. Destiny 2 is your next lifestyle game, but not because its progression systems are more enticing, or because its loot is particularly fabulous, but because it is a world-class shooter and a chill time with friends.Destiny 2 is a persistent online FPS set in our solar system in the distant future. Four alien factions have converged on Earth to seize the power of a vast orb called the Traveler, which acts as humanity's silent protector. The Traveler's tiny drones, known as Ghosts, resurrect humans to serve as immortal Guardians charged with defending the planet. There are three flavours of Guardian to choose from. Warlocks can zap enemies with lightning, Emperor Palpatine style; Titans throw down shield walls and punch bad guys really hard; Hunters shank foes while dodge-rolling and tethering hordes with shots from a bow made of glittering purple energy. You pick your class, design your character, and get levelling.It's a game of three phases. The singleplayer story gets you to level 20 and introduces the universe map, which you'll use for the next hundred or so hours to fly between planets to explore their open world zones, take on three-player Strikes (dungeons, to you and me), fight other players in 4v4 Crucible contests, and eventually take on the six-player raid. As you move through the story Destiny 2 starts laying the groundwork for phase two, beyond level 20, when you start hunting for weapons and armour to grow your new power level from 100 up to 305. This means repeating strikes, taking on public events in open world zones and doing short missions called adventures that extend the story on each planet. Phase three kicks in when you're close to the power level cap. At this point most activities in the game drop worthless lower level rewards and the game sputters out. You can expect 30 or so hours of quality shooting before you hit Destiny 2's doldrums. I think the journey is worth it.Destiny 2's plot is simple. A warlord called Ghaul leads the lumbering rhino-people called the Cabal in an attack on Earth. He wants to siphon off the Traveller's power for himself, and you have to stop him across five or six hours of missions scattered across Earth, Titan, Nessus and IO. \u00a0As the old Arthur C. Clarke saying goes, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Destiny's fiction lives in this blurred area. Guns housing advanced AI fire ammunition that breaks apart reality. You might find wearing a far-future astronaut suit, or a helmet made from the bones of an extinct race of space dragons. Destiny's universe works better when you consider it as an anthology of these cool sci-fi ideas rather than a linear story. The Cabal are the main threat in this game, but every faction can bring their bespoke on-brand apocalypse scenario to bear whenever Bungie releases an expansion.

Hunters can break out the bow, one-shot enemies with a flaming gun, or dice up mobs with an electric staff depending on the subclass you have equipped\u2014warlocks and titans have their own variants.After hundreds of hours of Destiny 1 and many hours of Destiny 2, it still feels great to dismantle a mob like this, and Bungie's shooter expertise translates surprisingly well onto PC. Mouse and keyboard controls, combined with a stable 60 fps of performance, adds an extra sense of control and fluidity. My experience with the PC version has been excellent. Destiny 2 has extensive settings menus that let you gear the game to your rig. It feels great to broaden out the field of view and absorb more of the game's gorgeous space vistas. Some of the default key bindings are off for me, but these too can be extensively rearranged to fit your setup.Destiny 2 has a loot box system that lets you use real money and scarce in-game currency to buy cosmetic items from the 'Eververse' store.Your level caps out at 20, but you continue to earn XP and fill your levelling bar past this point. Each time your levelling bar fills up you get a 'bright' engram that decodes into a package of premium cosmetic materials. These can be ships that you show off on loading screens, new skins for exotic guns, emotes, and shaders that change the colour of your gear.You can also buy XP boosters that apply to you and your fireteam, however this simply accelerates the rate at which you're getting bright engrams for filling the levelling bar after 20. Shaders drop so often in the main game that I have never even considered buying a package with real money. It's an unintrusive and easily ignored loot box system, and you get regular drops from the premium pool as you play.Destiny 2's first 20 hours are exhilarating. You see new planets, each of which benefits from some extraordinary art direction. Titan's missions take place on an industrial complex on stilts, which sustains a vast golden age arcology overrun by the Hive's corruption. The zone flows from man-made superstructures into defunct futuristic museum. The range of visual ideas in this one place alone would be enough to sustain a game by itself. Inevitably the splendour of the universe fades as you start blasting through zones to find a public event and try to secure some 280 power trousers, but there are few sci-fi games on PC that match Bungie's vision. The raid, when it arrives a week or so after launch, takes place in an opulent golden space palace.It's a spectacular place to be, especially with friends. Destiny 2's positive multiplayer environment is as vital to the game's success as its weapon and encounter design. There is no public chat. Instead you opt in to communication, via voice or text, with your team mates in PvP, or your co-op fireteam. If you set the option in the menus, you can choose to receive whispers from strangers, but otherwise your communication with strangers is limited to comedy emotes. Agile menus let you seamlessly glide into co-op fireteams. Few games let you segue in and out of co-op so easily, and Destiny's imposed silence leaves no room for shitty behaviour.Destiny 2 is a limited game if you play purely solo, but it is almost impossible to do that. Singleplayer missions move in and out of public spaces, and the game seems especially likely to trigger public events in these moments. These impromptu free-for-all missions often see an alien faction drop an objective into the world\u2014a mining drone, perhaps, or a scanner\u2014which you then have to defend against waves of incoming enemies. Everyone who runs into the area joins the event and becomes part of a ragtag assembly of fellow Guardians blasting hundreds of enemies for the promise of a treasure chest.

All of the bouts are four-on-four contests. All level differences are removed, but everyone is free to bring any guns from their armoury into the fight. A quick play match will randomly throw you into a team deathmatch scenario, a control point capture mode or supremacy mode, which is the best of the three. In supremacy every player drops a glowing crystalline 'engram' when they die. You pick up enemy crystals to score points, and secure friendly ones to deny your opponents. Supremacy creates an exciting tension between long and short-range weapons\u2014picking someone off with a sniper is useless if you can't pick up their engram, but might be the right move if allies are closer to the kill zone. Expect lots of baseball slides to secure engrams under fire, and look out for Guardians rampaging with swords.The game runs at a solid 60+ fps at 1080p on a GTX 970 with settings on ultra. There is a wide range of settings that give you control over your window mode, resolutions, Vsync, field of view, screen bounds, brightness, anti-aliasing, SSAO, texture anisotropy, texture quality, shadow quality, shadow quality, depth of field, environmental details, character detail distance, foliage shadows distance, light shafts, motion blur, wind impulse, HDR, chromatic aberration, and film grain. There are extensive key rebinding options too.Performance faltered for me when I moved onto a 4K monitor. At this level you will need a top graphics card and to move some settings down to get a decent framarate. The anti-aliasing solutions aren't amazing but if you have a top card on a 1080p display consider upping the render resolution. It costs a lot of frames, but smooths out Destiny 2's jaggies.Read our full performance analysis from the beta for more.Competitive mode is split between a Counter-Strike style attacker vs. defender bomb defusal mode, and the brilliant survival mode. This gives each team a pool of eight lives, shared between players. It's team deathmatch with extra reason to be cautious. Tension escalates as both teams go low, and rounds can often end with a clutch play in a one-on-one showdown. Both of these modes also feature in the elite Trials of the Nine challenge, which is scheduled to arrive at weekends from November onwards. Here the most skilled Guardians with the best PvP gear battle for access to a special vendor who sells her own set of elite items.Destiny PvP is unconventional by PC shooter standards. Positioning and skillful reading of the radar are essential skills. The best teams sit on comms and carefully manage their supers and loadouts to maximise their killing efficiency (letting off a super generates power orbs that pals can collect to charge more supers). Twitch skill is certainly a bonus, but mobile objectives, small teams and smartly designed maps strongly discourage camping and lone snipers. It's a fun drop-in experience that serves as a consistently entertaining diversion, though if you are mainly interested in strong player vs. player team shooter, you are better off with any of the big dedicated arena shooters.Co-op Strikes are another important feature, but it's telling that they feel so superfluous at the moment. There are five, but they are only accessible via a random playlist that often forces you into. Strikes are full missions set in specially built areas. They normally consist of a series of combat encounters that culminate in a big boss fight, but feature some neat twists, like the Inverted Spire's quarry of giant whirling blades that comically splat your fireteam. Bosses tend to be huge, tough enemies that cycle through several phases as you deplete their health bar. One hides behind energy shields and snipes you, and you have to defend glowing pressure plates to pierce his defences. They are decent missions, especially when you start taking on their weekly nightfall variants, which introduce time limits, extra elemental damage and other modifiers to increase the challenge. However, Destiny 2's loot systems offer little incentive. The rewards feel slim for the time investment compared to public events.More of these problems emerge as you move towards the end of Destiny 2's levelling curve, and the game settles into a holding pattern.

Week-long Faction Rallies also ask you to pledge allegiance to a faction and fight in their name in any Destiny 2 activities with the hope of beating the other factions and earning their special gun. It's a neat idea, and the comings and goings of Trials of the Nine and the weekend vendor Xur, make Destiny 2 feel like a living game. The problem is that after a while most items, especially armour, start to feel like purely cosmetic upgrades.Exotics are the most valuable drops in the game. You can only hold one exotic weapon and wear one piece of exotic armour at a time, and they even come with a few paragraphs of prose that teaches you a bit more about Destiny's dense but fascinating lore. However the four warlock exotic helmets I have all offer inscrutable ability recharge buffs that don't feel as though they change my character at all. The same issue applies to the entire mod system, which lets you slot small upgrades into armour to grow your overall power level and gain minor buffs that might let you reload energy weapons a little faster, or grant you more resilience. As long as your power level is on point, the type of gear you wear barely matters.Weapons are more interesting, especially when they are tuned to specialise in certain situations. Risk Runner become electrically charged when you take electricity damage, for example, so it's particularly good against enemies like the Fallen, who routinely carry electric weapons. Items like this have character and utility that makes them desirable, and Destiny 2 could use more of these at the top level of the game to give Destiny 2's most determined players something to chase.The layers of level values, stats and damage numbers in Destiny can give the wrong impression. Destiny 2 is fundamentally a great shooter slotted into a lightweight levelling structure. Don't expect much in the way of RPG-style character building with skill trees and strong character builds. The three stats that govern your character's speed, resilience and recovery values have a minor effect on moment-to-moment play, but it's not worth worrying much about, and the simplistically organised subclasses leave little room for character customisation. My warlock feels like any other warlock in the game.It's a shame that Destiny 2 runs out of gas in its final stages, but there's a chance that the DLC drops and the promise of reorganised reward structures will make Destiny's multitude of activities relevant again in the endgame. When the supply of spectacular new locations, new bad guys and new guns runs out it's remarkable how those extraneous progression systems\u2014the ladder of incremental damage value upgrades, grinding for drops\u2014becomes the entire focus of the game. I suspect Bungie see the loot system as the means, rather than the end, a way to draw players back together to enjoy social experiences. It comes back to the lifestyle game you want. If you're after an infinite action RPG then Destiny 2 is a few DLC packs and expansions away from that, but if you're after a regular light dose of beautiful sci-fi shooter fun, the perfect post-pub co-op jolly, or the game that will have your fireteam shouting in joy at your monitors when a raid boss goes down, Destiny 2 is a very well-made shooter and one of the best co-op games on PC.Gorgeous guns, a glittering universe, and a great port.

It is the righting of the wrongs committed by the divisive Destiny 1, a game I couldn't help but pump a thousand hours into despite it often feeling like pulling teeth.The developers at Bungie, with Halo-fuelled egos dented from the mediocre critical reception that enveloped Destiny's delayed 2014 launch, have wiped the slate clean like a raid boss swatting away a troublesome fireteam. This respawned shared-world shooter sequel is the game Destiny 1 should have been, free from frustration, respectful of players' time and inspired in its level design.And yet I can't help but feel Destiny 2 doesn't quite add enough that is genuinely new to the Destiny mix for a sequel that arrives over three years after its predecessor. It's the one glaring issue that prevents Destiny 2 from joining the pantheon of the shooter greats.It is perhaps best to start with what Destiny 2 doesn't do, rather than what it does, so sweeping are its attempts to shove past indiscretions under the carpet. Destiny 2 doesn't tell a terrible story, as Destiny 1 did. The 10-hour campaign is leaps and bounds above the nonsensical mess that came before it. With a light-hearted tone and a handful of likeable characters, Destiny 2 takes the player on an enjoyable sci-fi romp across the solar system fuelled by an angry Cabal who reckons the Travelers's gift of immortality has made the Guardians soft. So he takes it away - and you have to take it back.We visit four brand new areas: what looks like post-apocalyptic Germany; a lost human city on the stormy seas of Titan; the mysterious Vex-infused Nessus; and the sulfuric yellow moon, Io. The story, which is let down by some Syfy z-movie dialogue and a handful of other, more forgettable characters, at least has its beginning, middle and end in the right order. Destiny 1's frankenstein plot couldn't even manage that.Bungie though, still seems to struggle with straight-up storytelling. Cutscenes are packed with eye-rolling exposition, no-one says anything particularly interesting and character development boils down to re-powering the de-powered Guardians - a well-worn trick that doesn't have the impact Bungie would like it to. The theme of mortality bubbles under the surface of Destiny 2's campaign, but it never reaches boiling point. I would love to delve deeper into Ikora's character as she struggles to come to terms with the loss of the light-giving Traveler and her newfound mortality. In the end she, like all the others, seems to have learnt a valuable lesson without having gone to class.What carries you forward is the fact that Destiny, like Halo before it, is the best-feeling shooter around. Guns pack a proper punch and super abilities rock the screen. The simple act of squeezing the right trigger is a joy, the console aim assist caressing the inexorable flow of bullets into the path of heads that pop with a satisfying burst of alien blood, their bodies exploding in a shower of particle effects, glimmer and, if you're lucky, an engram or two.Bungie is the master of tailoring a few minutes of frenetic combat to a fireteam of a few players. Things get hectic enough to require just the right amount of concentration to succeed. Use super powers, throw grenades, hide behind cover, keep an eye on your health bar and fire the right big gun for the job. In between the fighting, follow the waypoint marker ever forward. Destiny 2 is made up of four decently-sized open-worlds, but missions are entirely linear.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "472baaf3-1eba-46a5-b631-e4b82ab7d64c": {"__data__": {"id_": "472baaf3-1eba-46a5-b631-e4b82ab7d64c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "293fcc51-7a31-4902-bd04-8e95158856ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b460e9620b6988cf1ffc1437e9b06046db76104d84b310630355ae1a662a3ee8"}, "3": {"node_id": "2fde33b9-7dee-4dd1-be45-487c87992516", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "16d36bfc61cec95b43ef1e3bcf5b3c667b6ed107a4371d9d6a9122de47418c95"}}, "hash": "54335b07d0a1d1e5b928c958bd095b8d2c80649f42bd4e27e2263ca58e797e56", "text": "Go here, activate that, defend this, put this ball in that hole, press forward. It's pretty mindless and nothing that hasn't been done plenty of times before, but it's all so silky smooth it's hard to tear yourself away from the television. Playing Destiny 2 is a bit like driving a brand new Audi along a quiet country road, its engine quietly humming, its steering wheel an extension of your hands.Then a stunning environment, a gorgeous vista or a level twist jolts you out of your comfort zone and all you can do is stand motionless in awe. Bungie's incredible art team has produced its best ever work with Destiny 2, creating a virtual world - well, four of them - that rekindles memories of the science fiction you imagined while reading books as a child.The highlight is the play space on Titan, an abandoned human colony that rests on crashing waves. Inside is the New Pacific Arcology, Destiny 2's best campaign level. Here the tone shifts as we descend deeper into the sinking city's innards, archaic public announcements now kicked back into life, lights flickering, futuristic floors giving way to creepy corridors. You go deeper underground (Bungie loves taking players down, down and down some more) until you grab what's needed and make for a dramatic escape via a surprising vehicle. This is up there with the best of Halo.There's an incredible sense of scale to Destiny 2's environments. The maps are massive, but, crucially, more densely packed than Destiny's and more encouraging of exploration. Eye-catching detail, from weird alien markings scrawled on walls to dimension-ripping portals, is everywhere. And graphically, Destiny 2 is a tour de force that benefits greatly from leaving the last generation of consoles behind. When I first set eyes on the crashed human colony ship on Nessus, its gargantuan rockets jutting out of the ground in the distance, I thought, blimey, this is what 700 developers gets you.Destiny 2, of course, is about so much more than its campaign. It is about loot and how it fuels the improvement of your character. Destiny 1's soul-destroying progression is ditched in favour of a relatively simple levelling up system that involves repeating certain activities on a weekly basis. Bungie has done well to increase the number of activities available compared with Destiny 1, adding variety to the post-campaign game in the process. There are Strikes (missions designed for teams of three players), Adventures (post-campaign story missions), Lost Sectors (multi-tiered mini-dungeons meant to be stumbled upon while exploring) and loads more NPCs to turn tokens into for reputation and elaborate exotic quests to toil over. They're all designed to randomly spit out slightly more powerful weapons and armour than you have currently equipped, and in the medium term at least, satisfy your rabid hunt for a higher power.Then the infamous Destiny grind returns, but it's much less annoying this time around. Like Destiny 1, Destiny 2 takes an average of the power level of each item to determine your overall post light level cap power rating, but this time you don't have to soldier through levelling up each item. This is a huge time saver and much more intuitive.Your power level rises fast after you hit the soft level cap, but progression soon slows as Destiny 2 funnels players through more difficult, endgame activities such as heroic Public Events, the weekly Nightfall strike, the Flashpoint activity and the Crucible. But the point to make here is the process is no longer abstruse. Even zipping about the world is easier. Bungie, clearly inspired by community created-apps that made playing Destiny 1 just about tolerable, marks upcoming Public Events on the map (now there's a map!) and lets you fast travel from anywhere to anywhere (no need to go to orbit first, thank god). These seemingly innocuous tweaks are a revelation for the long-term Destiny 2 experience, and are evidence of a developer that is willing to not just listen to feedback, but do something about it.Bungie has re-tooled the Crucible to feature teams of four rather than teams of six, and separated playlists into easy-going modes and hardcore PvP. It's an overall more strategic experience that seems designed for some sort of esports play. Super availability is clearly signposted at the top of the screen, and the time to kill has been reduced. In some ways, Destiny 2 PvP feels more like Halo than Destiny 1, which is very much a good thing.

The wait for Destiny's take on the warthog continues...Destiny 2 is also more accommodating of players who might not have friends to play with or a huge amount of time to pump into the game. The Guided Games feature encourages highly-skilled players to help those who need it. Join a clan and you'll get nice purple engrams when your clan-mates complete endgame activities. In short, Bungie has opened up the progression process in clever ways. It still takes time to level up, but it's a more fun time. Destiny 2 is still all about making numbers go until they won't go up any more, but Bungie now officiates the process like a good referee - the fans don't notice because there isn't much to get upset with.Eventually, as your power level creaks towards 300, Destiny 2's raid presents itself. The pressure was on Bungie to outdo Destiny 1's Vault of Glass, which to this day remains one of the finest first-person shooter experiences ever. It hasn't quite managed that, but it has come up with something unlike anything else in Destiny 2, and that's very much a good thing.Leviathan is a golden puzzle box that sits on top of a galaxy-travelling world eater. It is a Terry Pratchett fever dream, a drug-fuelled Prince concert, a tumble up and down an M. C. Escher staircase.Destiny raids should be experienced unspoiled (your first time is always the one you remember), but know this: the Leviathan focuses more on puzzle-solving and execution than it does overwhelming waves of enemies and killing big bosses. It stresses your concentration more than it does your power level. It's as frustrating as it is thrilling.What's fantastic about Leviathan, however, is it makes sense. As you explore its maze-like interior you get the feeling the tunnels and rooms and corridors and were actually worked out in someone's garage on a dusty table with cardboard cutouts. It is consistent. This bit leads to that bit leads to that door that opens if we do that. If there is a list of wonders of the video game world, The Leviathan should be on it.Predictably, microtransactions return for Destiny 2, and they're a bit more problematic than they were in the first game. For one, Bungie points players to the in-game shop, called the Eververse, by handing out Bright Engrams occasionally. Shaders are now consumables, which means they're one-time use for individual pieces of armour. Bungie says this change is meant to encourage gameplay, but it's just annoying. And Eververse sells gameplay-affecting mods,\r\n which is a worrying start for the store. All this in a full-price game. At launch, I've managed to get on fine without dropping real-world money on in-game currency, but I am concerned that as Destiny 2 evolves, so will the pull of the Eververse.You won't find Zavala or Cayde or Ikora spouting their nonsense on Leviathan. You won't hear relentless exposition out of your plucky sidekick Ghost (who elsewhere in the game never shuts up). Leviathan itself does the talking. It is video game world building at its best. I have given myself over to Destiny lore, which despite the universe's reputation for poor storytelling is fascinating, complex and super cool. I want to know more about the Traveler. I want to know what really happened during the Collapse. I want to know the true nature of the Darkness. My drive to keep up with the Joneses - aka my clan mates - in the loot race is matched only by my desire to learn more about this incredible universe Bungie has concocted. That is very much a good sign for Destiny 2.But Leviathan, for all its sparkling brilliance, does not do enough to elevate Destiny 2 to equal status with Bungie's very best. I just can't get past the feeling this sequel is a hugely successful refresh, but doesn't realise Destiny's potential. It is as good a quality of life upgrade as Bungie could be expected to deliver, with almost every change unequivocally for the better. But where is the new class of Guardian? Where is the new alien race? Where are the six-player fireteam patrols?Perhaps we'll have to wait for an expansion or - gulp! - Destiny 3 for Bungie's Halo killer to achieve true greatness.

On a surface glance, everything looks the same, albeit rendered with arrestingly greater detail and vitality. Campaign missions. Strikes. Open-world planets. Public Events. PvP. The bullet-point list reads like business as usual. But this is anything but. \u00a0Destiny 2\u2019s radically new personality and philosophy are first laid out in its campaign. Where the first game\u2019s many joys were largely systemic, living within its beautifully honed and deliciously malleable combat and character crafting systems, here, that stuff is \u2018just\u2019 the core of something much greater. What we have in Destiny 2\u2019s story campaign is almost incomparable to the first game\u2019s narratively-linked series of escalating arena fights and dungeon crawls. It still makes use of such things, of course, as it cuts a path through Destiny 2\u2019s multi-planet open-world. But what we have here is also a full-blooded, immaculately paced, pure FPS campaign, built with all the story, scale, and set-piece insight Bungie perfected over the 13-year period of its pre-Destiny shooter work.\u00a0Destiny 2\u2019s campaign is a hell of a good Halo game, basically. While we expected the quality of dynamic, emergent, cat-and-mouse gunplay exemplified in the first Destiny to ring loud and true through Destiny 2, in truth this sequel has an even louder pulse. Brought to vibrant life by way of many aggressive, upgraded evolutions to enemy types, AI behaviours, and increasingly imaginative, more freeform weapon design, Destiny 2\u2019s core combat is a constantly surprising, demanding, and exhilarating experience, even to those of us who spent upward of 800 hours with the first game. That it now exists in a campaign framework of far greater ambition, in all areas, from escalation to emotion, makes for an engrossing and at times dizzying experience.The campaign\u2019s last few hours in particular revel in a glorious acceleration of peril, design, ideas and craft.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9c9822d-6dbf-4753-91bd-7848bda9547e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9c9822d-6dbf-4753-91bd-7848bda9547e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "67792303-93f2-475f-ac84-d5527c9d6217", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6697d72bb66876e1de495ec7f39140a753f350c5cd7acb15a8242afe60a0710"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3609a85-dbc9-4953-b2cf-f4fbbacf732e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "813f0ff6d2bd73f6be9bdec1a0464ad9bb2ff7605ead8e461ece94a343caa459"}}, "hash": "fc3c4641080958069e17e03dddf69c80e7ee469b1c1db3df8d572be3b5443aa5", "text": "If you need a reminder of why Bungie is such an important studio \u2013 hell, if you need a reminder of just why you fell in love with story-driven shooters in the first place \u2013 Destiny 2\u2019s campaign is that. With the narrative advantages that come with three years of a persistent, lived-in universe, set upon a raft of background lore than has been studiously pored over for just as long, Destiny 2 nonetheless delivers a story of total immediacy and in-the-moment drama, able to electrify long-term fans without at all leaving newcomers out of the party.But this, to trot out the inverted commas once again, is \u2018just\u2019 the in-road to Destiny 2\u2019s wider world. And it is a world altogether more human, direct, relatable, and immersive than it has ever been before. This is Destiny evolved into something brand new, through a combination of warm, emotive, radically expanded character focus and consistently canny construction. I said in one of my early entries in our review diary that Destiny 2 feels like stepping up to Destiny: The Movie. Andy said that it makes the first game feel like a prototype. A couple of weeks later, both of those statements now stand even stronger than they did when we wrote them.A world that at times previously felt like it existed as a description of itself is now a real place, that lives, breathes, and matters. New players will find a fantastic and absorbing universe to play in. To stalwart Guardians, the evolution will be an initially strange experience, but a rather beautiful, oddly profound one as well.But that is, in every sense, just the start.Destiny 2 is such a vast game that I have to break its component parts down individually in order to discuss them, but in truth, Destiny 2\u2019s triumph comes from the fact that they are inseparable. While the campaign is a focused salvo of shock and awe, it rapidly melts and disseminates its influence throughout the open-world. Dense with a steadily expanding, nonlinear array of spin-off story missions (known as Adventures), and later, multi-stage Quest narratives, the world that Destiny 2 builds around its campaign truly delivers the dream of a fully-fleshed, open-world RPG/FPS hybrid.Although spread over four smaller, self-contained planets rather than one vast map, the richness of Destiny 2\u2019s world blends the options and exploration freedom of a Far Cry with the spiralling, free-form, narratively-driven side-quest structure of a Witcher. But just as good as the breadth and depth of the world is its spirit, which ensures that its experiences come without hierarchy. Destiny 2 is a world of vastly different, organically linked experiences, and it resolutely ensures that all of them are worthwhile, both in the immediately gratifying moment and in terms of the long-term journey of loot and character evolution.\u201cThis is the idea of Destiny evolved and elevated into something it has never been before\u201dWant perpetual combat and frequent gear drops? The Strike playlist has you covered. But if you wish to potter around at your own pace, exploring side-stories, engaging in dynamic skirmishes, investigating secret areas, and completing challenges and treasure hunts, you can do just as well with that. Destiny 2 is a game that wants you to enjoy whatever you feel like doing at any given time, and it wants you to know that it always approves of your decision. Forget the old days of being mechanically funnelled through specific, \u2018elite\u2019 content lists, toward increasingly narrow caches of high-level loot. Destiny 2 is the game you want it to be, whether that\u2019s a rambling, single-player, open-world FPS with a levelling system, a gear-grind focused MMO, a welcoming, co-op hangout, or anything else in between. And for all the wealth of vastly different content that lives in its open-world, it\u2019s the new, stripped-back progress system that really makes everything gel into a single organic whole.\u00a0Streamlined, simplified, but far more purposeful and empowering than before, Destiny 2\u2019s Token system, which bestows redeemable, universal gear currency for every activity completed in any given area, ensures that every single event enjoyed \u2013 from a hardcore, co-operative Nightfall Strike, to a lore-filled, narrative side-quest, to a meandering, solo hunt for the many Lost Sector mini-dungeons and hidden treasure chests \u2013 is equally meaningful, pushing you forward with a real sense of control over your experience. Everything is an investment. Nothing is wasted. Everything pays forward eventually, without demand or coercion. \u00a0And the way that Destiny 2 reveals its journey, too, is the product of a transformative rethink.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3609a85-dbc9-4953-b2cf-f4fbbacf732e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3609a85-dbc9-4953-b2cf-f4fbbacf732e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9c9822d-6dbf-4753-91bd-7848bda9547e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fc3c4641080958069e17e03dddf69c80e7ee469b1c1db3df8d572be3b5443aa5"}, "3": {"node_id": "ace7598c-a01b-4949-9a93-75296a244fec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d8dda82562aeed3f724c21f2db516a5280708c0c61ca30400518a1c7ef21646"}}, "hash": "813f0ff6d2bd73f6be9bdec1a0464ad9bb2ff7605ead8e461ece94a343caa459", "text": "Steadily building out the world around its campaign, it quietly introduces its greater scale and possibilities to new players and old alike while holding back any serious hint of the long-term, RPG game until the end of the campaign. All of the big-picture stuff, and the many different ways of tackling it, Destiny 2 leaves until later, bedding each element in a logical narrative off-shoot and ensuring that it only appears at the exact moment the player is ready to embrace it. At times, Destiny 2\u2019s empathy for the player experience is borderline clairvoyant.With such a rich world and a clear-cut progress system, levelling up in Destiny 2 is about feeding and serving the gameplay experience, not the other way around. The basic trading up of gear leads to new means to earn more special gear. That in turn leads to the means to customise and increase the power of that gear, which leads to access to new activities, and further means of customising and empowering. And the bountiful currency fuel for all of this remains constant, arriving in reward for every move you choose to make, with a generosity that will make players of the first game crick their necks in surprise. Unlike the first Destiny, this is not a game about fighting to reach an arbitrary final number, but one concerned with revealing and discovering new ways to play, that in turn create more new ways to play, along whichever of its many paths you wish to take.\u201cThis is Destiny set free. It\u2019s Destiny democratised. It\u2019s a warm, human, generous Destiny for everyone\u201dThose paths are paved with design excellence, whichever routes you choose. The combat-intensive Strike missions are now far more than \u2018tough levels with boss fights\u2019. Taking inspiration cues from all of the first game\u2019s greatest successes \u2013 particularly the experimental, abstract, combat-puzzle extravaganzas of the Raids \u2013 Strikes now have unique personality and stand-out demands. A hint of conceptuality even, at times. In one case it might be a boss fight that requires methodical, role-switching, co-operative tactics to best. In another it might be the grand scale of a cinematic, insta-kill obstacle course. Or it might be a dash of darkness-hampered exploration platforming, or a surprisingly dramatic blend of gameplay mechanic and narrative through-line.\u00a0How to level up fast in Destiny 2This creativity is also rife in the Adventure and Quest missions, which frequently take advantage of their spin-off nature to twist and rework Destiny 2\u2019s gameplay and story beats in some strikingly surprising directions. I\u2019ll spoil nothing, but I will tell you to make sure you absorb everything on the map at some point. The Token system might make it all profitable, but the quality and imagination present make everything thoroughly worthwhile in terms of pure experience.Destiny 2\u2019s Crucible PvP has had as fundamental a rethink as everything else, and has benefitted just as much. With one-hit kills now a rarity \u2013 whether they come from scarcely fuelled Power weapons, or super abilities that now require a great deal more nuance to use effectively \u2013 and team sizes reduced to four, the chaos that sometimes hampered the first game\u2019s PvP has entirely left the arena.Replacing it is a set-up that really lets Destiny 2\u2019s competitive combat shine in a tight, focused, clear, and tactically co-operative format. Playing with a fully communicative Fireteam is a relentless joy, as intellectually stimulating as it is knife-edge exciting. But even when playing pick-up games with randomly match-made players, the clarity of battle both supports and encourages the drum-tight team tactics that make the new Crucible feverishly compulsive and rewarding.And then, of course, there\u2019s that Raid. Leviathan, the first of Destiny 2\u2019s grandiose, hours-long, six-player combat puzzle dungeons picks up the baton admirably and, although we haven\u2019t finished it yet, has already more than justified its place. At their best, Destiny Raids are - systemically and in terms of team camaraderie - some of the best experiences in modern gaming. Uncompromisingly challenging, and brutally demanding of shooting skills, co-ordination, and lateral, deductive thinking, the process of deciphering and defeating a Raid should deliver a nourishing high and team bonding experience like no other. And while it would be deeply remiss of me to spoil anything \u2013 discovery, after all, is the whole point \u2013 even by just the third section, Leviathan\u2019s grand, slightly more cinematic take on the Raid format has bestowed all of that in spades.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ace7598c-a01b-4949-9a93-75296a244fec": {"__data__": {"id_": "ace7598c-a01b-4949-9a93-75296a244fec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3609a85-dbc9-4953-b2cf-f4fbbacf732e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "813f0ff6d2bd73f6be9bdec1a0464ad9bb2ff7605ead8e461ece94a343caa459"}, "3": {"node_id": "a25d5d05-804f-432c-b008-7cc7e3371daa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a077853153044ea4d6f469344d78ce16333a9076f7b35a62f95a8d4a58560b0"}}, "hash": "0d8dda82562aeed3f724c21f2db516a5280708c0c61ca30400518a1c7ef21646", "text": "Completing it is our team\u2019s new life obsession, and will remain so until we emerge victorious. At which point we\u2019ll certainly go back in for better gear.And rounding off all of this brilliance are the many quality-of-life improvements marinating the entire Destiny 2 experience. Taking many cues from the ways its community played the first game, Bungie has instilled Destiny 2 with a plethora of over-arching systems that smooth any last hint of pain out of the journey. Clan support lets any player, whether running a packed-out friends list or playing solo, feel part of the community, and share in material rewards for cumulative success on a weekly basis. Guided Gameplay (currently in beta) finally opens the doors to high-level activities for everyone. Can\u2019t put together a six-person Raid team? No problem.

It\u2019s Destiny set free. It\u2019s Destiny democratised. It\u2019s Destiny really allowed to live. I said at the end of my review of the first game that I was leaving a point off the score to leave space for the game\u2019s potential to grow and improve. This time round, there\u2019s no need.

The most obvious reason for that is its perfectly judged action, which is so intrinsically satisfying that despite the lack of variety in enemies and missions it remained entertaining hundreds of hours later. This combined with the, often forlorn, hope of receiving useful loot for your efforts created one of the tightest, and most addictive, gameplay loops in video games history.But the other secret to the game\u2019s success is Destiny\u2019s social element.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a25d5d05-804f-432c-b008-7cc7e3371daa": {"__data__": {"id_": "a25d5d05-804f-432c-b008-7cc7e3371daa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "ace7598c-a01b-4949-9a93-75296a244fec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0d8dda82562aeed3f724c21f2db516a5280708c0c61ca30400518a1c7ef21646"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8df96ad-f092-4f43-82e2-6ddc2e90cdff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d7c69092fe3176b3b70309ed6f4691bbcdde6adc9481c07d27b42a8b6e8cf1c"}}, "hash": "0a077853153044ea4d6f469344d78ce16333a9076f7b35a62f95a8d4a58560b0", "text": "Not just in the sense that you can play all the various modes with other people but that doing so becomes a social ritual in itself, the game becoming a mere excuse to talk to friends online \u2013 when there\u2019s not the time or the energy to meet face-to-face.Although developer Bungie always resist calling Destiny an MMO it has all the elements of one, including the fact that the gameplay itself becomes less important the more you play it. Even if that goes against the grain of most classic video games that\u2019s not a criticism. But if you rejected the original because it felt more like the game was playing you than you were playing it, then Destiny 2 does help to redress that balance.Since it\u2019s been out for more than a week now we\u2019ve already covered various elements of Destiny 2 in other articles, including a detailed review of the story campaign. The original had virtually no plot, but despite bigger speaking roles for all the background characters the sequel barely has one either. What there is revolves around a faction of the Cabal turning up to destroy the last city on Earth, and while the campaign that results from this is much more tightly designed than Destiny 1 there\u2019s still very little story or characterisation. And very few answers to any of the outstanding questions about the game\u2019s lore.The set pieces are more structured than the first game but those hoping for something similar to Bungie\u2019s work on Halo will not be satisfied. And as has been obvious for months now Destiny 2 makes no major changes or additions to its gameplay, with no new classes (just one new subclass for each of the existing ones), no major changes to weapons or amour, no new alien races, and no obvious improvement for the mediocre artificial intelligence.The locations are all new, and yet they still manage to look very similar to the ones from the first game. But the way the open worlds now work represents Destiny 2\u2019s most substantial, and positive, change. The various planets were always very pretty, and fairly large, but they never offered anything terribly interesting to do \u2013 just randomised fetch quests and boss-orientated public events.In Destiny 2 each world is filled with side missions, dungeon areas, challenges, and co-op opportunities. It\u2019s still very repetitive at heart, and we don\u2019t understand why the public events aren\u2019t randomised more, but the patrol zones now feel far more alive and interesting.Destiny 2 is also a lot better at encouraging you to try new things, with a list of \u2018milestones\u2019 to complete that push you into trying out all the different styles of play. Once you reach the level cap of 20 (which you\u2019ll likely do just as you complete the story campaign) the game makes it much clearer how you can up your \u2018Power\u2019 rating in order to compete in high level activities like Nightfalls and Raids.It\u2019s still essentially level-grinding, but now the rewards are much more consistent and reliable. As long as you take on a challenge appropriate to your current level you\u2019re almost never left disappointed with your loot, and as a result the \u2018just one more go\u2019 feeling is even stronger than in the first game.This also means that the paid-for microtransactions are far less alluring than Bungie might have hoped, and many players feared. Although not all of the \u2018bright engrams\u2019 contain purely cosmetic items we were never in the least bit tempted to pay money for them. In part because the turnover of new loot is so fast, but especially because you\u2019re given free ones every now and again anyway.Although the original Destiny couldn\u2019t really be recommended if you were only ever playing alone, you can quite happily make your way through the majority of Destiny 2\u2019s content without ever interacting with another person. And because Nightfalls and (starting from next week) Raids now have matchmaking it\u2019s possible to play the whole game without having to organise a team yourself. But if you do join a clan there are extra rewards and customisation options to ensure you don\u2019t regret it.In terms of competitive play we still don\u2019t find the Crucible very interesting, despite the change to uniform 4v4 line-ups, but it\u2019s the best way to both show off your character and to get some of the more interesting weapons and armour. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, but it feels far less distinctive than the other aspects of the game, especially as one of the new play modes is a Counter-Strike knock-off.The Strikes are very well designed though, and so too is the first Raid, which was the last major addition to the launch line-up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8df96ad-f092-4f43-82e2-6ddc2e90cdff": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8df96ad-f092-4f43-82e2-6ddc2e90cdff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "a25d5d05-804f-432c-b008-7cc7e3371daa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a077853153044ea4d6f469344d78ce16333a9076f7b35a62f95a8d4a58560b0"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a3b8b71-aef0-4919-9b60-c7bb369e0552", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5add4def2c9a4ad81971f0afdbc344f3334a32e9022c9cce7874470830baa79c"}}, "hash": "3d7c69092fe3176b3b70309ed6f4691bbcdde6adc9481c07d27b42a8b6e8cf1c", "text": "According to Bungie\u2019s roadmap there\u2019s much more to come, even just in the next two months, and we hope so too because despite Destiny 2\u2019s increased volume of content it\u2019s still possible to burn through the majority of it in a week or so.That\u2019s a problem for another day though, and we have to admit that despite never feeling fully engaged with the original we have thoroughly enjoyed our time with Destiny 2. It\u2019s not even that it\u2019s less repetitive, there\u2019s just a longer list of things for you to replay again and again. But thanks to the revamped patrol zones and less po-faced tone it feels more organic and less sterile than the first game.It\u2019s probably still not the experience many imagined when Destiny was first announced, though. And to us the most fundamental issue is that the game really needs to offer something to do other than just shooting.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023But there are no puzzles or dialogue sequences, and instead every problem has to be solved by shooting monsters and collecting what they leave behind. You can sense the mission designers straining to pretend otherwise, but no matter what the context your only interaction with the world is via the barrel of your gun.The occasional platform jumping or vehicle race is such a welcome change of pace we hope that Bungie will eventually be able to create something that feels less ruthlessly one note. But as limited as their tune may be we can\u2019t deny that they play it perfectly.In Short: Despite a disappointing story campaign this is a notably improved sequel, whose endless loops of addiction feel far more honest and rewarding than the first game.Pros: Perfectly hewn gunplay and much wider range of things to see and do, especially in the open world maps. Streamlined upgrade path and excellent Strike and Raid design. Great graphics.Cons: The storytelling is still very basic, and the Crucible remains competent but far less distinctive than the rest of the game. Repetition will still get to you sooner or later.Score: 8/10\nFormats: PlayStation 4 (reviewed), Xbox One, and PC\nPrice: \u00a354.99\nPublisher: Activision\nDeveloper: Bungie\nRelease Date: 6th September 2017\nAge Rating: 16Email\u00a0gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and\u00a0follow us on TwitterSign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan\nGame Informer, Bungie took a big chance when it chose to reset three years of progress and start all players, new and returning alike, at ground zero for Destiny 2. The risk has allowed for a reinvention of troublesome systems and a new opportunity for players to climb the level curve, while still maintaining the successes learned across the many updates of the first Destiny. The result is a game that is more accessible, streamlined, and sensible, with a clear through line in both gameplay and story. However, this refined sophomore effort in the Destiny universe comes at the cost of flexibility to play how you want and fully customize the experience as you go.\u00a0Newcomers to Destiny 2 will discover the same core precepts that have kept others engaged for years. Hundreds of years in the future, humanity\u2019s fate has been reshaped by a powerful alien entity, spreading our reach across the solar system. A later inexplicable collapse has left a scattered people scrambling for survival, guided and protected by deathless Guardian warriors.

Your character grows in power alongside friends that inhabit the same public playspaces, and they join you in all manner of integrated exploits.If the first Destiny introduced the universe, Destiny 2 is the story that begins to make meaningful changes to the status quo. With no mention of a nebulous Darkness to be found, we instead have a game all about Light, a power that sets humanity apart and represents concepts of hope, self-sacrifice, and resilience. That focus on Light and its meaning lends an optimistic tone to the plot. In the wake of a devastating opening in which The Last City is brought to ruin, the Guardians are scattered, and power lost. The dramatic setup leads to a coherent and straightforward tale that spans the solar system, and culminates in several stellar set piece confrontations, including a thoughtfully concocted central villain. Individual missions are varied and smartly paced, and I love that we get some more insight into the minds of our supporting cast.I relished the adventure, but some of the magic and mystery I've come to expect is absent. Some of the most troublesome and cryptic story elements from the earlier game also made its universe feel bigger and stranger, and I'm not sure Bungie has managed to replace characters like the Awoken Queen, or design concepts like the Grimoire, with equally curious alternatives. Most enemy types return from Destiny 1 with only minor alteration, diminishing the disquiet of facing a new threat.\u00a0I'm also mystified by the decision to lock so much of the story content away after its conclusion, replayable only in prescribed chunks a few times each week. The inability to relive favorite moments outweighs the gains in simplifying the map with fewer icons. Likewise, I'm stymied by the absence of an option to select individual strikes, and their inclusion only as part of a playlist. These excellent small-team cooperative expeditions are great fun, but seem almost relegated to an afterthought following the campaign.Breathtaking environment art and design maintain at least some of the story mystique I was looking for, accompanied by a dizzying and inspiring orchestral soundtrack. Every one of the major sites visited in Destiny 2 is majestic, beautiful, and vast, from a European forest overrun by alien conquerors to a grand underwater city hiding beneath the methane waves on one of Saturn's moons. Bungie creates compelling and intimate battlefields, but also communicates the grandeur of massive, daunting backdrops.The first Destiny offered large open planetary destinations with little narrative context. The biggest change to gameplay is a welcome reorganization of those destinations into compelling spaces for exploration, punctuated by clearly marked sites for blistering battles beside other players. Mini-dungeons called lost sectors provide a sense of discovery. Public events are easy to find, and even feature fun heroic variants for those in the know. And a bevy of excellent new story quests and adventures extend the narrative potential post-campaign, revealing the story of these locations and their characters.Crucible play has been overhauled in substantial ways, and moment-to-moment combat feels more competitive. Teamwork is highly valued in every mode, and encounters take a split-second longer to conclude, with fewer one-shot kill options on the table. I quite like the change, which adds up to more strategic and thoughtful engagements.\u00a0From the new and intense Countdown game type to returning modes like Control, every Crucible match type demands players move and play in different ways. Yet again, I'm perplexed by the decision to force players into one of two playlists, quickplay or competitive, rather than let them choose their preferred mode. I'm also torn by the move to exclusively four-person teams in PvP; the compact group size demands everyone pull their weight, which is great. But neither three-person strike teams or six-person raid groups can easily transition into competitive play, a symmetry that was ideal in the prior game.If most of Destiny 2 caters to accessibility and ease of play, the new Leviathan raid offers a potent counterpoint. The most challenging cooperative activity is a mechanics-heavy beast of an expedition in which constant communication is necessary, and nearly flawless play is required. The sprawling pleasure palace is one of Bungie\u2019s most intricate and fascinating environments to date, accentuated by a maze of secret passages and hidden chests beyond the main encounters. My biggest issue is with the new reward system, which separates the excitement of new gear from the moment of victory, and doesn\u2019t offer most loot until a full completion. Without the ability to gather much new gear as you progress through, there are few ways to gear up for the next battle.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a588155c-2ac0-413e-9406-b1573e77c0c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a588155c-2ac0-413e-9406-b1573e77c0c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a3b8b71-aef0-4919-9b60-c7bb369e0552", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5add4def2c9a4ad81971f0afdbc344f3334a32e9022c9cce7874470830baa79c"}, "3": {"node_id": "6cad791b-411c-4669-bddd-15ddb71d7b1d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1b5d82083ce2812b7709b4e0e0368549583078ec28bfb89a5c03df5509bd82ef"}}, "hash": "c86eb49c6eaff8a8b234cae84b3eba9cd5fe92b85d0971943de5207aa067ae7d", "text": "Your choice of Hunter, Titan, or Warlock class shapes the experience, whether exploring as a lone wolf along a moon of Jupiter, grouping up for challenging cooperative challenges like the briskly paced new Nightfall strikes, or trying to hold ground in the Crucible. All classes play well and offer their own avenues to mastery. The reliance on mostly returning subclasses within each of the three is a tad disappointing, but each has been tweaked in purposeful ways. Add in a new and aggressive offense subclass for each, from the aerial superiority of the Dawnblade to the melee-oriented Arcstrider, and you have several thrilling playstyles to explore. Each subclass features two pre-optimized paths. Yet again, it\u2019s a design choice that puts even new players on equal footing with returning players, but the more limited customization options sting. \u00a0Progression is smooth from opening to endgame, thanks to an elementary milestone system that always suggests meaningful content to confront, and an in-game map that is easily navigable. A new clan system makes friend groups more important, and offers substantial rewards, even if they also create some danger of insular bubbling with players you already know. \u00a0No matter the preferred style of play, collectors are in for a treat. New exotic weapons and armor are joined by welcome revisions of old favorites, and everything from legendary gear to emblems are a lot of fun to gather. Gear comes fully powered now, so you're free to play with the gun or helmet you like, rather than waiting to power it up. Even so, I'm bummed that most items have so few customization options, as I have fond memories of tweaking those as I played in Destiny 1. Vault and inventory management have seen only minor changes, and even in these early days the management chores aren\u2019t much fun.\u00a0While I love all the collections, the cosmetic customization system has taken a step back, offloading and embedding many of the coolest ships, shaders, and other visual trappings within the microtransaction system alongside a slow-paced alternative to earn the same packages through play. Being able to apply shaders to weapons and vehicles is a great addition, but the system discourages experimentation, since shaders are consumed on use. A rich equipment modding system is also sadly looped in with the microtransactions, diminishing an otherwise compelling power customization tool.\u00a0A veteran player of any game is likely to home in on criticisms, and there's a danger of getting lost in the weeds, which would be a mistake. Destiny 2 is a massive and rewarding game that offers the potential for hundreds of hours of fun and discovery with friends. Quibbles aside, Bungie has crafted a fantastic follow-up to a wildly popular formula, and one that no other developer has come close to equaling in sophistication. Many of the streamlining choices welcome a new crop of Guardians into the mix, but also make this new game more playable and understandable for even returning players. As I settle in for what I hope to be another several years of adventures, I hope Bungie can nail the elusive balance between depth and accessibility.\u00a0\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

And while it may be smaller (and cheaper) than a traditional Destiny 2 expansion, Bungie\u2019s passion for its own games shines through, turning the package into a delightful celebration to close out Destiny\u2019s quietest year.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences. When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.The Grasp of Avarice dungeon is the star of the update (along with its loot), and the only playable paid content in the pack \u2014 the rest of the cash goes primarily to special cosmetics and dungeon exclusive weapons. It\u2019s a pirate-themed lark through the original Destiny\u2019s infamous loot cave. And after running through it multiple times, I can confidently say it\u2019s the best dungeon Bungie has created.To go with its pirate theme, the first fourth of the dungeon is littered with booby traps, leading all the way to the first boss. If there are two doors presented, one of them is going to kill you as soon as it swings open. I\u2019ll never forget watching my teammate get launched into outer space after throwing a random switch on a walkway. It makes failure fun, and ensures I\u2019ll take a backseat every time I bring a new player through, just to see what traps they spring.The dungeon is pure joy \u2014 to play for the first time, to run through with a friend, or to adventure in over and over again looking for that perfect loot roll. Destiny often takes itself quite seriously, and it\u2019s earned that, to an extent, as Bungie has really ramped up the storytelling and worldbuilding over the past two years. But the Grasp of Avarice is explosions, and spike traps, and a giant barrel rolling down a hallway. It\u2019s situational fun that you can\u2019t help but laugh at. But the Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack is more than a single piece of content, and the studio\u2019s enthusiasm for its previous work emanates through more than just the Grasp of Avarice. There\u2019s a free event in the pack, a handful of Exotics (one free and one paid), and a load of new cosmetic items. Many of those items and weapons take inspiration from Bungie\u2019s past games, with fan-favorites from the original Destiny, guns and armor from Marathon, and even a big sword from Myth. But the biggest surprise is the inclusion of Halo-themed items.I play Destiny 2 with a lot of Halo fans \u2014 most Destiny players I know are well-versed in Bungie\u2019s former IP \u2014 and when someone shouted \u201cI got the Battle Rifle\u201d for the first time, it was an almost emotional experience. Of course, it\u2019s not the real Battle Rifle \u2014 that would be legally dubious, I\u2019m sure. But it is made by Bungie, so what\u2019s the difference? It feels perfect. It\u2019s a piece of nostalgia I can interact with daily for years to come.These old Bungie weapons are lovingly crafted, with unique perks created only for them. Players usually only get a single unique Legendary a season, but the update is full of them. Using the Forerunner Exotic sidearm, based clearly on the Halo: Combat Evolved Magnum, is some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in Destiny in years. It not only plays on my love for Combat Evolved\u2019s pistol, it\u2019s also a great, new Destiny weapon that\u2019s useful and fun to use.It feels like Bungie\u2019s developers let themselves run free with this release. They mined their previous work for its greatest hits, and selectively brought the studio\u2019s most treasured items into its modern game. And because of this celebration, I\u2019ll be able to have a little Halo with my Destiny for years to come \u2014 assuming Bungie doesn\u2019t bring back weapon sunsetting, which it canceled earlier this year. If I want to use my Halo Battle Rifle, Myth Claymore sword, and Marathon shotgun to take down Savathun next February, I can. But it doesn\u2019t feel like a rehash. Yes, it trades on nostalgia, but it\u2019s not a simple cash grab.

Bungie could\u2019ve made this pack for the hardcore players that miss some of their favorite, old Destiny Exotics that never got ported to Destiny 2. \u201cIt\u2019s got Gjallarhorn, it\u2019s got a new dungeon, hey look, it\u2019s a Halo sword.\u201d But after spending a week with the new content, it feels more like the developers made the 30th Anniversary Pack for themselves. It\u2019s a small distinction, but one that makes a big difference. The passion that comes through is intoxicating, and it permeates the entire package. It makes me care about all of Bungie\u2019s previous work as much as the studio does, even if I only started playing its games with Halo: Combat Evolved.The next time I can sucker a friend or co-worker into playing Destiny with me, the first thing I\u2019ll tell them to buy is the Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack, and I\u2019ll run them through the Grasp of Avarice dungeon. Not because it\u2019ll earn them Gjallarhorn \u2014 the series\u2019 most famous weapon \u2014 but because it\u2019s the perfect showcase of how special Destiny can be when Bungie\u2019s own passion shines through.

The structure is largely the same, as is the mechanically excellent shooting and satisfying loot grind. But there are a variety of changes both under the hood and throughout your activities that make it a significant improvement over the original and a better experience for more than just the most hardcore players.From the onset, there's an overwhelming amount of stuff to do. The Red War story funnels you through the four areas you can explore, introducing you to each one as you go. At each destination, there's a bunch of optional activities to choose from, including story-like Adventure missions, simple loot dungeons called Lost Sectors that lead to hidden areas of the map, and public events and patrols, which return from Destiny 1. Then, as you progress through the story, you'll unlock the strike playlist and PvP in the Crucible. For a newcomer to Destiny, it can be hard to decide what to do and when.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Destiny 2 Video ReviewThe Red War story missions are less about plot and more about acclimating you to everything there is to see.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d34a3f8-2961-415d-a1a9-7099d14af3dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d34a3f8-2961-415d-a1a9-7099d14af3dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "057c944f-3b78-4ff6-8055-be96d0887dff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "915198d651d56f5f115104f34fc6c5819ce6ac2a66afb1a7e80fd718e7e176d9"}, "3": {"node_id": "fffb016f-588d-4840-b763-f941206598f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "647f90d15ac72bf8ccb016112b6fc04e9d347264d7620771cb31fa695e45f6b4"}}, "hash": "e69971cd6fa9a88efe1a25a5789596553a742ece4022549dd80a2009a8ab413b", "text": "You'll level up at a pretty steady pace, but there are two level-gated missions that essentially force you to complete Adventures and other activities for XP before you can move on. There's no actual reason for the missions to have level requirements, which can be annoying, but having direction is welcome after Destiny 1's lack thereof. And aside from netting you XP and loot, the semi-hidden Lost Sectors reward exploration while Adventures are filled with lore and interesting details about the world that fall outside of the scope of the main story. If you're burnt out on standard PvE, you can switch to PvP to level up, which requires different gear and skills.The story is enough to serve its main purpose, which is to contextualize the shooting and looting you're doing through it all. Its villain is a derivative conqueror figure with a hunger for power and destruction, and the save-the-world plot is tired. But you don't need to know much to get going except that humanity is in danger, and you of all people have the power to help. The story's strengths lie in atmosphere and side details, like the endearing craziness of the deranged AI Failsafe or the mysteries of the Vex machine race, and that should be fine for the majority of players who see the story as something to rush through in order to reach the high-level \"endgame.\" The mournful soundtrack in particular is fantastic, and it carried me through the most basic story beats, even on repeat playthroughs.Like Destiny 1, there's a lot of grinding to be done between finishing the story and moving onto the high-level endgame activities like the Nightfall strike and the Raid. And again like in Destiny 1, the shoot-and-loot feedback loop feels fantastic. The gunplay is still excellent, and being rewarded for your efforts with an even better gun is something worth celebrating. The biggest change is how much quicker it is to increase your Light level--now called Power--with minimal grinding early on. The combat isn't any easier because of it, though, so it simply takes away the Destiny 1-era frustration of running the same few strikes a dozen times before you can move on to literally anything else. Plus, knowing you might get a slightly more fashionable pair of gauntlets from a five-minute public event gives you the kind of instant gratification that will sustain you through to the endgame.There's a decent variety of weapons and gear to find, mostly in random drops. And once you know what gear is desirable, it becomes a fun metagame to hope you'll find it. A favorite around the GameSpot office has been the exotic auto rifle Sweet Business, and though no one has been using it, we had a lot of fun embarking on the quest to get Rat King. You might get lucky and get what you want right away, but for most people, finding a combination of great weapons for both PvE and PvP and gear with abilities that complement them takes some time. As far as customization goes, the Eververse and its microtransactions return, though leveling up after the official level cap grants you the new Bright Engrams that can be redeemed for consumable shaders, emotes, and more (for free). The change to shaders wasn't popular among fans at first, but making them consumable allows for a greater range of customization on different pieces of armor as well as weapons.Some activities and areas are more cleanly or interestingly designed than others, and after a handful of hours, you'll start to identify the ones you love to play again and again and the ones you aren't as fond of. At least two of the Crucible maps are circular in design and essentially funnel you to your death if you aren't paying attention, which can get pretty boring; some areas require a fair amount of platforming, which can vary from tolerable to tedious depending on your class. But others are laid out in all the right ways to be memorable and fun to replay, like the Arms Dealer strike that keeps you running from room to room and preserving your heavy ammo for a series of tanks.Though there's plenty you can do on your own, Destiny 2 is undeniably better as a shared experience. That can come on many different levels; you can work silently with complete strangers to trigger a heroic public event that gets you all better loot, and on the opposite end of the spectrum, you can coordinate with five friends for hours on end to tackle the Raid. You can also join a Clan, which can grant you a number of passive benefits, like legendary gear, as long as someone in your Clan is meeting certain milestones.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fffb016f-588d-4840-b763-f941206598f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fffb016f-588d-4840-b763-f941206598f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d34a3f8-2961-415d-a1a9-7099d14af3dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e69971cd6fa9a88efe1a25a5789596553a742ece4022549dd80a2009a8ab413b"}, "3": {"node_id": "14d0eebc-95ec-4921-8f1d-3a1fa9fa9ad4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "639dfe399440e9bae88b5aff9d393bf7398c452e908709e5633a9b88446ecd46"}}, "hash": "647f90d15ac72bf8ccb016112b6fc04e9d347264d7620771cb31fa695e45f6b4", "text": "On top of that, Destiny 2 also introduces Guided Games, where solo players can search for groups who are short one person and willing to help them through difficult endgame activities like the Nightfall or Raid.Success through strong teamwork is absolutely the best part of Destiny 2.Success through strong teamwork is absolutely the best part of Destiny, and the top-to-bottom tweaks and additions in Destiny 2 make it more accessible without dampening your sense of accomplishment. Meeting the level requirement for the Nightfall or Raid and actually completing it are two very different things, and getting in sync with your Fireteam and flawlessly executing a strategy takes a lot of work. The first two Nightfall strikes, for example, both introduced a modifier to the original strike that forces you and your team to coordinate loadouts and stay in constant communication about which weapons and subclasses you're using. You have to figure that out while also shooting waves of enemies and trying not to die. You'll most likely fail, but each failure helps you perfect your strategy incrementally, and the process of collectively achieving that goal is immensely satisfying.At the highest level, the vast and visually striking Raid combines the need for top-tier weapons and gear, picking the correct subclass and loadout based on what your team needs, strong combat skills, and problem-solving as a group. Destiny 2's first Raid, Leviathan, is very, very difficult, and solving its often obscure puzzles can be both rewarding and frustrating. For the most part, each failure teaches you something new, and the GameSpot Raid team actually cheered when we came up with a solid strategy after going in blind. But there was one section in the middle that we struggled to complete even after we figured out what to do conceptually. Of course, this was after about five straight hours of raiding, so fatigue was definitely a factor--but it didn't blend the puzzle-solving part with actual execution as well as the previous sections of the Raid.In true Destiny fashion, if you do something once, you'll probably end up doing it many more times. The difference with Destiny 2 is in the variety and accessibility of what's available, which cuts down on a lot of the frustration associated with grinding. And even after you've leveled up, there's still more you can do, from keeping up with daily and weekly challenges to just hanging out with friends. It's a much stronger foundation than the original had and one that's enough on its own to keep people coming back week after week.Editor's note: Now that Destiny 2 is out on PC, we've put that version through its paces in both solo missions and competitive multiplayer matches. The PC version comes with the usual suite of graphic and control options, and ran smoothly on our test PC built around a GTX 1070.

Three years ago, Bungie launched Destiny amid staggering levels of hype, and the massive canyon between expectations and reality led many people to write off the next big thing that wasn\u2019t. After the trying times of the first two expansions, Destiny came into its own with 2015\u2019s The Taken King, but could never shake the reputation hanging around its neck like an albatross.It\u2019s understandable that Bungie would want to make a full sequel, to leave the baggage of Destiny behind and start fresh. At the same time, of course, Destiny 2 has to relish and reward the relationships that existing players have built with the franchise over the past three years.Catering to newcomers and veterans alike is a tough balancing act.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14d0eebc-95ec-4921-8f1d-3a1fa9fa9ad4": {"__data__": {"id_": "14d0eebc-95ec-4921-8f1d-3a1fa9fa9ad4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "fffb016f-588d-4840-b763-f941206598f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "647f90d15ac72bf8ccb016112b6fc04e9d347264d7620771cb31fa695e45f6b4"}, "3": {"node_id": "9cf34493-8dee-4234-aac9-b7f5a45b0410", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f7abcc448ffac25f8e539ff9b3f6d4a1c6d60e6d9b3823ec01697a46e5a30b3"}}, "hash": "639dfe399440e9bae88b5aff9d393bf7398c452e908709e5633a9b88446ecd46", "text": "Some longtime players are still mad that all their existing gear, which they earned over dozens or hundreds of hours with Destiny, is gone \u2014 narrative justification be damned. And while everyone\u2019s excited about being able to play Destiny 2 on Windows PC, the lack of support for cross-platform characters is frustrating.But that may all end up as water under the bridge. Perhaps the highest compliment I can pay to Destiny 2 is that it makes its predecessor seem even worse in hindsight. I spent nearly 20 hours with the sequel during a preview event three weeks ago near Bungie\u2019s offices in Bellevue, Washington. During my playtime, I repeatedly found myself wondering how I had ever put up with all the nonsense in Destiny. Because most of it is gone in Destiny 2.If you can tell me exactly what happened in Destiny\u2019s campaign \u2014 without resorting to Google or the Grimoire, the lore cards that weren\u2019t even in the actual game \u2014 then you deserve a prize. The confusing plot barely provided enough of an excuse to fly around the solar system and shoot aliens, while its clunky dialogue was dragged down by an overuse of sci-fi gobbledygook.Bungie\u2019s writers stepped up their game in Destiny\u2019s expansions, and they\u2019ve taken another stride forward in Destiny 2. The inhabitants of Earth have never been in a more perilous position than after the Cabal invasion of The Last City. The surprise attack results in the destruction of humanity\u2019s only safe haven on the planet, and the loss of everybody\u2019s Light \u2014 the mystical force gifted by the Traveler that sustains and empowers Guardians and Ghosts.Destiny 2 offers a dizzying array of things to doMuch of the story concerns the nature of the Guardian initiative, with the three class Vanguards going off on their own introspective searches for meaning (along with quests to find a way to fight back against the Cabal Red Legion). So far, the writing has asked weighty questions like what does it mean to be a Guardian, but I didn\u2019t see much of a payoff during the story missions I played. (Bungie stopped us at what seemed to be three-fourths of the way through the campaign.)The effort to save the solar system is the propulsive force behind Destiny 2\u2019s narrative. But it\u2019s almost as important that there\u2019s an actual villain in the story to give a face to the alien invaders. Dominus Ghaul, the Red Legion leader, has an inferiority complex to match his imposing figure. Confounded by the Traveler\u2019s decision to give its Light to humans \u2014 inferior beings, in his eyes \u2014 Ghaul attacks the giant white orb and takes the Light by force. Of course, nobody thinks they\u2019re the bad guy, and the cutscenes involving Ghaul do a good job of explaining his motivations beyond wanting to extinguish life on Earth.I don\u2019t want to oversell the story here; it\u2019s a standard sci-fi tale with familiar tropes and roles. But it provides a suitable framework to explain what you\u2019re doing in the campaign. There are strong characters among old friends and new faces alike, and you learn about Destiny\u2019s universe as you get to know them in cutscenes and mission dialogue. This applies whether you\u2019re an existing fan or a new player; the dialogue differs to account for that.Outside the campaign, the four destinations\u2019 individual hosts anchor open-world activities on the respective worlds. Each of these characters has their charms, but the best one is Failsafe. As the only survivor of a Golden Age-era shipwreck on Nessus, Failsafe is an AI with a split personality \u2014 alternately friendly and sarcastic. (\u201cSeems like you met my new friends: Failsafe, and her evil twin, Failsafe,\u201d Cayde-6 says.) She\u2019s kind of like a more helpful version of Portal\u2019s GLaDOS, and it\u2019s tremendous fun to hear her interact with Ghost.Failsafe and her cohorts are characters that you can walk up to in Destiny 2\u2019s open world, which is another feature that somehow didn\u2019t exist in the original game. Destiny had problems galore, but most of the game\u2019s issues stemmed from a fundamental lack of content. In order to level up, players had to repeat the same few activities ad nauseam (and the activities themselves lacked variety or excitement).During the event, we all spent about three hours playing competitive multiplayer matches in Destiny 2\u2019s Crucible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cf34493-8dee-4234-aac9-b7f5a45b0410": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cf34493-8dee-4234-aac9-b7f5a45b0410", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "14d0eebc-95ec-4921-8f1d-3a1fa9fa9ad4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "639dfe399440e9bae88b5aff9d393bf7398c452e908709e5633a9b88446ecd46"}, "3": {"node_id": "b16b79f2-e162-47ec-a68f-60d35cde10a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "48c5064470f7e4de0ccff9463e797668f73786342ab3030d99fd8f7d05898bad"}}, "hash": "9f7abcc448ffac25f8e539ff9b3f6d4a1c6d60e6d9b3823ec01697a46e5a30b3", "text": "The game\u2019s new modes are some of my favorite additions.In Countdown, which was available in the beta, the defenders must try to kill their opponents before the attackers can set one of two charges \u2014 and must defuse a charge if it has been set. The Survival mode is a thrilling elimination-style offering in which each squad starts with a shared pool of eight respawn tickets. Once the members of a team use up those lives, they can no longer respawn. There\u2019s nothing like a Survival round coming down to the last Guardian standing on each side.It\u2019s hard to tell, but the maps didn\u2019t seem appreciably smaller despite Destiny 2\u2019s lowered player count of four-on-four Crucible games. The change might have been intended to make gametypes like Control feel more dynamic, but in the limited time I spent with it, the opposite was true. Covering three capture points with four people is a challenge, especially if your opponents have built up a big lead. Either way, this is another area of Destiny 2 where we\u2019ll have to see how things shake out over time.Destiny 2 offers way more (and more varied) open-world activities than its predecessor, and they provide a steady stream of useful loot. Patrol missions have largely been supplanted by two new activities \u2014 Adventures and Lost Sectors \u2014 while Public Events now play a much larger role.Adventures are the new side missions, and they serve as an elegant way to convey backstory and contextualize the campaign. Lost Sectors are semi-hidden areas in the world, denoted with a recognizable piece of graffiti that looks like a prehistoric cave painting of a tunnel. While it\u2019s possible to repeat them and get loot each time through, I found myself wanting more. Calling them dungeons is a bit of a stretch: None of the ones I played were any more difficult than shooting all the enemies until they were dead.Thankfully, I got plenty of challenge and excitement out of Destiny 2\u2019s Public Events, which are my favorite open-world activity so far. Each one presents a unique problem to solve, so it\u2019s rarely as simple as shooting anything that moves. Every Public Event has a tougher \u201cHeroic\u201d difficulty level that\u2019s unlocked by completing a hidden objective. In Destiny\u2019s expansions, Bungie often relegated these more complex mechanics and challenges to dedicated areas. It\u2019s smart for Bungie to have layered them directly into Public Events here.Public Events aren\u2019t just more interesting in Destiny 2. The game\u2019s new speed-focused interface makes it much easier to do them. There\u2019s now an in-game map \u2014 another baffling omission from Destiny \u2014 and it highlights Public Events in real time, so you\u2019ll know exactly where and when to expect them. This is a crucial design change. Even if you happened upon a Public Event in Destiny, you might\u2019ve failed to complete it if you weren\u2019t a one-person army. Taking the guesswork out of tracking Public Events should encourage Destiny 2 players to congregate around them, which will likely increase the chances that a group of Guardians will be around to team up to take on the challenge.It\u2019s also easier to get around using the map, thanks to landing zones for fast travel and a waypoint system that lets you mark locations and activities. (I remain confounded, however, by Bungie\u2019s decision to keep Sparrows locked behind random drops in Destiny 2.) These kinds of quality-of-life improvements make a huge difference in the experience of playing Destiny. They eliminate much of the busy work that was inherent to the original game, and they keep you from feeling the need to go outside the game for third-party tools like a Public Event tracker.Aside from the kinds of exercises you\u2019ll repeat, Destiny 2 offers some brilliant one-off activities. One of the highlights of my sessions was the side quest in which I unlocked the Gunslinger subclass for my Hunter. Sure, you feel awesome when you get to unleash the Golden Gun super attack at the end. But the journey is just as great, with storytelling that makes you feel like you\u2019re becoming one with the Hunters. (Destiny veterans will be thrilled to hear that they can also unlock The Taken King\u2019s subclasses \u2014 Nightstalker Hunter, Stormcaller Warlock and Sunbreaker Titan \u2014 in Destiny 2.)Doing these types of activities will earn you reputation with various allies, and it\u2019s a great way to get regular rewards. More importantly, it\u2019s fast.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b16b79f2-e162-47ec-a68f-60d35cde10a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "b16b79f2-e162-47ec-a68f-60d35cde10a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "9cf34493-8dee-4234-aac9-b7f5a45b0410", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f7abcc448ffac25f8e539ff9b3f6d4a1c6d60e6d9b3823ec01697a46e5a30b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "8de47afa-4a58-40e9-9616-3bc2948af09e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7305ec4970fcf6009a73beda881f53ef5bc1226f73ac321999430ac593766425"}}, "hash": "48c5064470f7e4de0ccff9463e797668f73786342ab3030d99fd8f7d05898bad", "text": "More importantly, it\u2019s fast. It took forever to grind faction rep in Destiny, but I earned enough EDZ Tokens for Devrim Kay to award me a bright engram within just a few hours of doing open-world activities in the European Dead Zone on Earth. That doesn\u2019t include strikes, which I couldn\u2019t get around to trying in the time allotted during the event.Destiny 2: Everything you need to knowBy the end of the preview event, my lady Hunter had reached the level cap of 20 with a power of 211. (Your Guardian\u2019s gear level is still a weighted average of the stats on your weapons, armor and class items, but in Destiny 2 it\u2019s called \u201cpower\u201d instead of \u201cLight.\u201d)In the original Destiny, the consensus held that the game didn\u2019t really begin until the post-20 grind \u2014 the campaign was just a (thin) excuse to get you to that point. That\u2019s not quite the case in the sequel, since there is plenty to do before you ding 20 (including a lengthy campaign with a worthwhile story.) But after level 20 is still where the rubber will meet the road in Destiny 2.Bungie told me that finishing the campaign will unlock a bunch of new activities and pursuits. And the game\u2019s reward economy in missions and open-world settings seemed well-tuned, regularly providing me with meaningful loot that raised my character\u2019s power level. In addition, you receive a bright engram each time you rank up past level 20. They\u2019re a lot more valuable than Motes of Light, the equivalent reward in the original Destiny.But while I have some sense of what I\u2019ll be doing after I hit level 20 in Destiny 2, I don\u2019t know if that grind will feel fun. The heart of Destiny is repeating endgame activities so you can get high-level rewards, either by earning enough in-game currency to buy them from vendors or by earning loot drops. That phase of Destiny was a pain because of the way Bungie structured the gear system and reward economy. It doesn\u2019t seem like those issues will plague Destiny 2, but at this point, I can\u2019t say for sure because I haven\u2019t had the chance to see the endgame.I also didn\u2019t get to play around with some of Destiny 2\u2019s new systems for tweaking gear, like weapon modifications. You can get mods as loot drops or from bright engrams, and they\u2019ll allow you to do things like alter the damage type on an energy weapon. Infusion works differently now: It requires Legendary Shards, and the number of shards needed depends on the rarity of the gear involved. That all sounds fine on paper, but we\u2019ll have to see the systems in action to evaluate them.At the very least, what I\u2019ve played of Destiny 2 is an incredibly promising start. In plain English, it feels like Destiny without all the bullshit. It seems like the sequel Bungie needed to make \u2014 not a fundamentally different experience, but improved enough over its predecessor to reel veterans back in and attract people who skipped the original Destiny. Now we have to see how it holds up.For much of its 10- to 12-hour length, I was enjoying Destiny 2\u2019s campaign just fine. I might\u2019ve described it as \u201cwell-made,\u201d the kind of adjective you use when you recognize something as a quality product but find yourself unmoved by it. Writing improvements aside, the missions tended to run together in my mind except for a few standout sequences.That all began to change around the midpoint of the campaign, a few missions before the point at which Bungie stopped us during the preview event. As the Vanguard began to uncover the true nature of the threat Ghaul presented, the missions became more closely tied to the story. The back half of the campaign gets steadily better as you progress, and the last third is spectacular, with memorable setpieces for the final two missions: a superweapon near Mercury, and an attempt to take back Earth from the occupying Cabal. In the former, I gawked at the blinding sun whenever I wasn\u2019t trying to avoid its searing heat; in the latter, I finished the fight when my comrades could not.Destiny 2\u2019s underdog story works because it operates on a relatable level, a human level. For three years, Destiny players heard tall tales of the class Vanguards\u2019 exploits, but we didn\u2019t see those three legendary Guardians in action, and thus couldn\u2019t understand why they were special.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8de47afa-4a58-40e9-9616-3bc2948af09e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8de47afa-4a58-40e9-9616-3bc2948af09e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "b16b79f2-e162-47ec-a68f-60d35cde10a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "48c5064470f7e4de0ccff9463e797668f73786342ab3030d99fd8f7d05898bad"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c08832a-b396-44b0-8bef-cb9b267e81c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "50845457206cbcc8243ce7d5a5a4a26515b26d5d337bfa0bf08533aeb4b6e356"}}, "hash": "7305ec4970fcf6009a73beda881f53ef5bc1226f73ac321999430ac593766425", "text": "Here, it was thrilling to watch Cayde-6, Commander Zavala and Ikora Rey (plus Suraya Hawthorne, the liaison between humanity and the Vanguard) operate as a fireteam in an act of true heroism. And it felt awesome to work with them to defeat Ghaul \u2014 our success wouldn\u2019t have been possible without everybody doing their part.Finishing the campaign unlocks, well, the rest of the game. As I said in my review-in-progress, nobody cared about the original Destiny\u2019s campaign, partly because the game really began once you hit the \u201csoft cap\u201d at level 20. That\u2019s still true in the sequel, even if its campaign is miles better. In fact, there\u2019s so much you can\u2019t do until you take down Ghaul that it almost feels like Bungie locked away all that content in an effort to make the post-campaign part of Destiny 2 seem bigger and more involved than it actually is.I finished the campaign at a power level of about 210. At that point, there are still a bunch of Adventures and other quests that you\u2019re not strong enough to attempt. Destiny 2 is either very smart about scaling up the difficulty of activities as you get stronger, or I just happened to be doing Public Events in regions with tougher enemies. Either way, it was blessedly rare that I found myself vastly under- or overpowered. The activities in question, though, mostly consist of strikes and Public Events; you\u2019ll be farming them nonstop to get your character up around 260 power. As a Destiny veteran, I was hoping for more variety in this segment of the sequel, and I suspect I\u2019m not alone among people who played the original game. (You can also gear up by playing PvP, if you like; it\u2019s not my thing.)To be clear, there is undeniably way more to do in Destiny 2\u2019s post-campaign phase than there ever was in vanilla Destiny. And what\u2019s there is more engaging and fun, unlike the drudgery that players of the original game dealt with. But so far, I\u2019m already feeling a little tired of the grind needed to get ready for the raid \u2014 even if Destiny 2\u2019s quality-of-life improvements make it much less annoying.One of the larger chunks of Destiny 2 that we\u2019ve not yet explored in this review is competitive multiplayer, and the surprising level to which it has changed from the original game.Destiny 2\u2019s PvP is much more team-centric than Destiny\u2019s ever was. Lone-wolfing your way through matches is no longer viable, mostly due to the fact that instant-kill weapons are not readily available. The bulk of your attacks will come from your energy or kinetic weapons, both of which take much longer to kill enemies than the weapons in the first game did. The end result? The only way to take down enemies quickly is with intense communication and cooperative shooting of the same target.This makes playing Destiny 2 PvP with friends a much more engaging experience. Even in deathmatch variants you\u2019re constantly having to call out radar pings and instructions to friends, granting your team a tactical edge over your foes. Smaller maps and team sizes (lowered from six in Destiny to four in Destiny 2) make communication a lot more manageable.This major change has ups and downs. As is often the case across modes in Destiny, if you\u2019re playing with friends, PvP is much more fun. But if you happen to be playing solo, Destiny 2 PvP is a generally miserable experience. Sure, you can attempt to follow your team of voiceless strangers, but even a small squad of two or three on the other side will dominate. Destiny 2 has plenty of one-person activities, but until solo-only matchmaking or free-for-all modes get added, lone wolves will be happiest sticking to PvE.As with any Destiny release, the end goal of Destiny 2 PvE is the raid. Set on a comically enormous Cabal ship called the Leviathan, the raid follows the same format as previous Destiny raids. Six players must complete extremely complex cooperative tasks, fighting various bosses and solving puzzles along the way.Destiny 2\u2019s raid looks unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in the series before. Clearly inspired by Roman architecture, the Leviathan is filled with bathhouses, pleasure gardens and, well, vice. Compared to the often gloomy, post-apocalyptic cities and barren landscapes of the rest of Destiny 2, the bright, gold-coated halls of this ship are a breath of fresh air.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c08832a-b396-44b0-8bef-cb9b267e81c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c08832a-b396-44b0-8bef-cb9b267e81c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "8de47afa-4a58-40e9-9616-3bc2948af09e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7305ec4970fcf6009a73beda881f53ef5bc1226f73ac321999430ac593766425"}, "3": {"node_id": "e81175fa-f0ce-4d5b-9209-2a1f0a528838", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e74cc4afab185dfd21a1e6d14c08751e77691ebae9cc6a50702c8d0e0c0f8dda"}}, "hash": "50845457206cbcc8243ce7d5a5a4a26515b26d5d337bfa0bf08533aeb4b6e356", "text": "It\u2019s much more visually welcoming than previous raids, which is great for people who have been scared off from even attempting one.Those brave souls who are new to Destiny raiding will find Leviathan\u2019s learning curve to be a little more forgiving than those of past raids, too. The initial combat encounter outside is not too hard to piece together on your own. A section in the aforementioned baths is also relatively manageable with a focused team.Unfortunately, things go south from there.Without delving deeply into spoilers, one of the encounters in Leviathan is heavily centered around stealth. You know what Destiny is terrible at? Stealth. Always has been. And yet, Bungie crafted a large chunk of this raid around not being seen by AI that, frequently, does some really dumb, unexpected things. On paper the encounter is ambitious and unique, but in practice it\u2019s a frustrating trial by fire that will discourage most of the people who attempt it.The stealth sequence is a shame, as the encounter that comes after it is spectacular, a wild neon game show that ends in a breathtaking team-wide race to the death.That brief sojourn into hilarious fun is once again dashed by the raid\u2019s last encounter, which, as of this writing, needs a lot of work. Unreliable bugs make the final battle in Leviathan obnoxious, even for the most coordinated teams. Like the conclusions of Vault of Glass, Crota\u2019s End or King\u2019s Fall upon their debuts, it\u2019s prone to breaking in unexpected ways. If a game is going to demand precision from its player base to succeed, players should expect the same from the developers who made it. Leviathan is just not at that level.As an overall product, Destiny 2 is an incredible feat. Bungie spent three years essentially beta-testing this game, and used the knowledge gained from its predecessor to improve and fine-tune just about every aspect of the experience. As with the original, there are still rough patches to pave over, but the astoundingly fun game here is beautiful, funny, varied and constantly rewarding to play. The first Destiny was a game that we played and enjoyed often in spite of itself; with Destiny 2, Bungie has crafted something that\u2019s genuinely worth the time, especially if you\u2019ve got a few dedicated friends willing to join you.Destiny 2 was reviewed using final \u201cretail\u201d downloadable PlayStation 4 codes provided by Activision.

Easy come,  easy go,  and Lucas without a backup plan.All the more important to hit the sequel as hard as he could. Right now,  Destiny 2 was huge on Twitch,  and he was picking up more new subscribers than ever. He looked down at chat. One commenter was sounding off about how he hated the changes to Destiny 2 PvP because it made it so much less fun to play solo. \u201cThat\u2019s true,  true, \u201d said Wake,  congenially. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot less fun solo. You get with some randoms and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing,  and suddenly your team is getting worked and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Even worse is how the game matches a team of randoms with a team of dudes in a clan,  who are all coordinating in chat together. Bungie\u2019s gotta fix that.\u201dThe truth was,  Wake wasn\u2019t having as much fun with Destiny as he used to. He wasn\u2019t sure what it was; maybe just that he\u2019d grown as a gamer,  or his tastes had changed. He\u2019d spent some time playing Overwatch back when it came out a year ago,  and had dabbled in streaming some Battlegrounds over the summer while Destiny was at a low ebb. PUBG was so much fun,  and so interesting compared with Destiny. Maybe it was just over-familiarity. The better he got at Destiny,  the more aware he was of its flaws.\u201cI don\u2019t wanna climb up Bungie\u2019s ass or anything, \u201d he said,  leaning back in his chair and looking away from the camera. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of stuff I still don\u2019t like. For hardcore players like me,  the endgame is already feeling thin. I feel like I\u2019ve already gotten everything there is to get. Servers are still weird for PvP,  like,  how often you trade with someone? Where you both die at the same time? With all the PvP stuff,  it is what it is. You all know what I\u2019ve been saying. You can\u2019t always look at Destiny like it\u2019s a true competitive game. It\u2019s not Counter-Strike.\u201dChat appeared to agree with him: Destiny 2 was not Counter-Strike. That was part of the problem,  really. Chat always agreed with him. Most people he talked to\u2014clanmates,  commenters,  subscribers\u2014tended to agree with him,  even though he knew he couldn\u2019t be right all the time. Maybe he just needed to spend more time with other streamers,  people who had their own fans and their own opinions. Maybe he should go and find a new game with a new community. Maybe he should just go back to school.Not now,  though. Now,  there was a new Destiny game out. There was a new raid to explore,  and new secrets to dig up. He had a new crop of excited viewers,  and his numbers kept going up. Trials had launched this morning,  and he\u2019d scheduled a full weekend of carrying lucky subscribers to the top of the Spire. He could think about life stuff later.\u201cThat was\u2026 fuck, \u201d said Sean,  yet again. Alex could hear a dry crack in his voice. Understandable,  given that they\u2019d been hammering away at a raid boss for seven hours straight. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we finally did it.\u201d\u201cWe did it, \u201d she responded. \u201cWe did do it.

You guys weren\u2019t in the shadow realm,  you don\u2019t really know how bad it got. It was a miracle.\u201d\u201cThere was a point when I didn\u2019t know what we were gonna do, \u201d said Sean. \u201cWe\u2019d sunk in so much time that it felt ridiculous to quit,  but winning seemed impossible.

I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dAlex muted her mic but kept her headset on as she walked down the hall to the bathroom. The wireless range got a bit dicy in here,  but she could still hear the party chat. Her apartment got so quiet at night. Not for the first time,  she wondered what her roommates made of the boisterous curses and exclamations that had been emanating from her room. Her headphones cut out,  and as the signal faded back in,  Will was talking.\u201c\u2026the most human interaction I\u2019ve had in weeks, \u201d he was saying. \u201cEver since the stuff with my ex,  I haven\u2019t actually talked to many people? Just my sister,  mostly. I didn\u2019t think I liked playing games with other people. I liked those guys we were with,  though,  and Alex seems cool.\u201d\u201cYeah,  she\u2019s great, \u201d said Sean. Alex smiled. She wondered if he knew she was listening in. \u201cI\u2019m glad she talked me into this. The game\u2019s driven me nuts for the past week,  but I can\u2019t say it hasn\u2019t been fun.\u201d\u201cYeah,  man, \u201d said Will. \u201cI dunno when I\u2019ll be have time to raid like that again,  but we should definitely play again soon. We should start a clan! I guess this is how you get into a clan.\u201dAlex double-checked that her mic was muted before she flushed,  then started back up the hall. As she walked,  she went over her remaining Destiny to-do list. An exotic quest had opened up after they finished the raid; it rewarded you with a weird looking shotgun. She\u2019d seen Wake streaming with it the other day,  and it looked beastly. Then there was the Crucible quest\u2014she was no great shakes at PvP,  but now that she had more friends to team up with,  maybe it\u2019d be more fun? And when would they raid again? Questions for another day.She sat down and unmuted her mic. \u201cOkay,  I\u2019m back. What were we talking about?\u201dAs I struggle to fall asleep after a night of Destiny 2,  the game keeps running through my mind. It\u2019s like getting a song stuck in my head: I see the flash of combat and feel the rumbling controller in my hands. But I rarely hear the sounds of battle. Instead,  I hear voices.For all the words I\u2019ve written about Destiny,  I\u2019ve listened to many more. Destiny is the game that I play with people,  and my impressions of it and this new sequel have been irrevocably shaped by the hundreds of conversations I\u2019ve had in and around the game itself. In between hurried strategy sessions and snippy cross-talk,  we share what we like and don\u2019t like,  what Bungie has fixed and what they still need to fix,  and where we see the game going from here.

I share Peter\u2019s appreciation of the many ways Bungie has made it more approachable than its predecessor,  and his frustration at how the game still occasionally manages to get in its own way. I\u2019m with Will on how therapeutic it can be; for all its surface-level violence,  Destiny 2 is an oddly soothing game. Wake makes some good points about the changes to PvP,  and I share his  sense that Destiny 2 might not hold my attention as firmly as the first game did. Alex understands how important it is to play with friends,  and how lovely it can be to coax a group of strangers into accomplishing something that seemed impossible.Destiny 2 is a more competent product than its predecessor,  and perhaps a less interesting game as a result. It doesn\u2019t have the same idiosyncrasies and shortcomings,  and it doesn\u2019t seem to hold its players in such low esteem. It doesn\u2019t dare us to break it as often.Bungie has stripped out so much of the nonsense we previously had to keep track of,  and almost every simplification has been for the better. They\u2019ve added a story that makes sense,  even if by doing so they\u2019ve robbed their robe-clad sci-fi world of some of its mystery. The raid is fascinating,  thematically ambitious,  and occasionally infuriating. The shooting is still fantastic; inventory management is still a pain in the ass. The armor isn\u2019t as pretty as it was in the first game.Like many modern video games,  Destiny 2 will spend the next few years in a constant state of becoming. Capturing its essence in this moment or that moment is as difficult as snatching a mosquito out of the air with two fingers. This is clearly a high point,  the highest since The Taken King launched nearly two years ago. It\u2019s a red-carpet welcome for new players and a slightly bittersweet payoff for those of us who\u2019ve been there from the start. Soon enough,  everything will change yet again.It\u2019s been two weeks since Destiny 2 came out,  and I could no more crystalize my impressions of it than I could transcribe the dozens of late night confessions,  emailed strategy sessions,  passive-aggressive recriminations,  and heroic exultations I\u2019ve shared with my in-game compatriots. That\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s live in the moment.

To cut to the chase, this is a game that finally makes good--sometimes a little too good--on Bungie's big idea of blending its genre-leading console first-person shooting with a Diablo-style loot dispenser, and it's been a long time coming. Remember 2014, when the first Destiny's notoriously fractured storyline and aimless, unfulfilling endgame grind left a large portion of its player base feeling shortchanged? Bungie does. On both counts, it's clear in playing Destiny 2 that Bungie learned most of the right lessons from the turmoil of Destiny's debut, even as it feels like the studio also forgot some of what made Destiny unique along the way.Destiny 2 certainly has a more coherent story than last time. The sequel turns the forgettable faction vendors from the first Destiny into living, breathing video game characters and casts them in a desperate fight for survival as a legion of particularly mean Cabal, the franchise's monstrous spacefaring version of the Roman Empire, shows up and kicks what's left of humanity out of its last refuge on Earth.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43d378bf-0183-45f2-8884-8da7b11cc02b": {"__data__": {"id_": "43d378bf-0183-45f2-8884-8da7b11cc02b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "72c71020-1dd3-423a-9fde-713ca2a59bba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "971e5c459c007558832ade1cea4539e48a8e74d771c091b6d4cb414efb9dd398"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d7833cf-686c-4a4a-a8e3-af30c83571d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "47b01a106bb9c1da31c55484de6da17a84d85c121fdaa2a571ba751423ebf563"}}, "hash": "6ad5dcaa972ee8682be281e9db95a25d59114644fc3ec7bc69c4a5617df78e46", "text": "These principal characters are scattered across the solar system as the Cabal busies itself stealing the god-like powers of the enigmatic giant space orb that makes Destiny possible, and you then spend a dozen-odd missions flying from moon to planetoid to capital spaceship and back, trying to recruit those faction vendors back into the fold so they can lead an assault on the Cabal occupation. In contrast to the nebulous mess of the original, Destiny 2's story is clearly presented and you never have to stop and scratch your head, wondering what you're doing and why. There are unique mission mechanics, fast-paced vehicle sequences, and a whole lot of enormity and spectacle that recall Bungie's best campaigns. It's epic and exciting and focused in a way the original Destiny wasn't.At the same time, there's a distinct shift in tone from the first game. Where Destiny was austere to a fault, the sequel overcorrects with a cast that sometimes feels like it's made up entirely of comic relief (and not all of the jokes are very comical), and the plot turns on more trite video game clich\u00e9s than I've come to expect from Bungie. The story revolves around a world-destroying super machine and a sneering one-note villain in a way that's a little too predictable, coming from a studio that's never really relied on things like mustache-twirling bad guys. Recall that the entire Halo series' long-running antagonist wasn't a single villain but a multi-species alien religious cult with a complex hierarchy and system of beliefs. The first Destiny struggled to even effectively explain who you were fighting against or what the stakes were, but I hoped for a little more than a vaguely generic bad guy who wants to blow everything up in the sequel.For all the incoherence of its plot, Destiny managed to imply the outlines of a vastly grander world than what was taking place right in front of you. It was a world with numerous alien factions each with their own agendas, rituals, and social structures--even if you had to dig through digital trading cards on your phone to fully understand everything--all taking place against the crumbling interplanetary remains of humanity's most triumphant era. A couple of those alien factions feel like they're reduced to set dressing in Destiny 2, and with a few exceptions there's less interest in building intrigue around the mysteries of a fallen civilization. The first game struck a unique blend of tangible and mystical. Its combination of post-utopian science fiction and classical mythology created a specific atmosphere that fired the imagination, and its setting among our solar system's most familiar and yet unknowable locations served a function of wish fulfillment, as you rooted around the remains of a research collective on Venus or explored alien cathedrals hollowed out of the goddamn Moon. Destiny 2 makes a similar attempt, but comes up short. Of the game's four locations, one is essentially a glorified oil rig, and while another, Nessus, is technically a real planetoid way out in the far reaches, who had ever heard of it before this game? To some extent this is all a matter of taste; Destiny 2 trades breadth for focus, and that'll work better for some people, but it resulted in a less memorable experience for me. Bungie's storytelling has always been a little weird, but not much of Destiny 2 is as weird as the first game.Having said all this, the conclusion of Destiny 2's campaign defied my expectations in some startling ways, and there's such an urgency to the last handful of missions and the world of Destiny is left so fundamentally revitalized after the last couple of hours that the ending did a little to relieve my relative disappointment with some of what had preceded it. Without getting too specific, the campaign leaves the world of Destiny in an exciting place, and sets up the franchise to deliver new stories in the future that are more in line with what I've come to expect from this series.There's a good chance you'll actually want to stick around this time for those new stories to drop over the coming months and years. The single best thing I can say about Destiny 2 is that Bungie has finally found a way to fit all of the game's nuts and bolts together to create a loot shooter satisfying enough that the only reason to stop playing it is because you've run out of things to do. And there's a lot to do. In addition to the campaign, all the activities you expect from the first game return, from patrols and public events in the open world to three-player strikes, the competitive Crucible, and weekly rotations of ultra-hard Nightfall strikes and Trials of the Nine competitive matches.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d7833cf-686c-4a4a-a8e3-af30c83571d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d7833cf-686c-4a4a-a8e3-af30c83571d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "43d378bf-0183-45f2-8884-8da7b11cc02b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ad5dcaa972ee8682be281e9db95a25d59114644fc3ec7bc69c4a5617df78e46"}, "3": {"node_id": "c982af05-7840-47fe-b1f3-6439f2f25ece", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f72d636b383404d71b1fcebe9c3e565f10bdccd47ad596aec4d3b1b764c5e86b"}}, "hash": "47b01a106bb9c1da31c55484de6da17a84d85c121fdaa2a571ba751423ebf563", "text": "And then, of course, there's a post-game raid for six players, a grueling cooperative challenge that can take you a dozen hours to analyze, figure out, and actually defeat.Sure, most of this stuff was featured in the first Destiny, but it's all been refreshed or improved here in significant ways. There are more types of public events now, and they all have optional heroic versions that are harder and yield more rewards (and are a challenge to unlock in their own right). Nightfalls now come with more inventive modifiers that dramatically change the way you play. The first game's Nightfalls merely increased various weapons' damage and forced you to restart the entire mission if your team wiped, leading you to play incredibly cautiously (or in my case, frequently not play at all). The new Nightfalls feature tight timers and rotating damage mechanics that require precise, coordinated, speedy play that's an exhilarating improvement on the plodding old version. The Crucible comes with a smattering of standard modes across multiple playlists, and while this sort of multiplayer with its player shields, high-flying jump jets, and all-powerful super abilities isn't for everyone, I've come to enjoy the smaller scale and more tactical nature of Destiny 2's multiplayer now that it's been reduced to four players. If nothing else, this makes it a lot easier to get a fireteam of three other people together to play with you, and a good fireteam with strong communication can really clean up in there.The key to making Destiny 2's activities and character progression so much more seamless and rewarding than in the first game is in simplification. Bungie has thrown out all the esoteric nonsense from the first game, with its half-dozen different types of upgrade currencies and weird quest items and other concepts that some players understandably balked at. In place of all that, there's now a simple reputation system where each planet and each type of activity has a vendor associated with it, and anything you do on that planet or in that activity contributes to your reputation with that vendor. When the meter with a given vendor ticks over, you pick up another item package. Rinse and repeat as necessary. Whether you're running a ton of strikes, or playing Crucible endlessly, or hanging out with friends and casually popping off public events and looking for treasure chests in the European Dead Zone, you're earning rep that will translate into new gear sooner than later. And all of these activities are tied together with a challenge system that gives you even more goals to work for and results in even more gear on a daily basis, with a weekly set of \"milestone\" quests that guarantee you gear well above your level if you complete the requisite activities. The game has a way of making you feel like you're working toward three or four different goals at once. Where Destiny sometimes felt too stingy with its gear drops, especially in the endgame, you'll quickly have more loot in this game than you know what to do with.Actually, that's the other thing that makes Destiny 2 work better: they upped the drop rates. A lot. You will not stop getting a steady stream of better gear right up till you're ready to tackle the endgame raid, and there are relatively easy ways to level beyond that. The elusive exotics--hand-crafted weapons and armor that were so rare in the first game Bungie added another item to increase your chances of seeing them--are now built-in quest rewards throughout the story and also drop at a startlingly fast pace. For the most part all this loot keeps the game humming along, and keeps the endorphines pumping steadily in your brain as you get new guns and armor at a steady clip. I can't believe I'm saying this, but at times it can instead feel like too much of a good thing, and I almost wished the game would pump the brakes a little. Some of the lower-level guns are quite fun to use, but during the early game you rarely use the same gun for more than an hour before you get something better and feel compelled to switch to the thing with the higher number. It doesn't always feel like a given loadout has time to breathe before you're shaking it up again.The bigger problem with getting so much loot is that you can level right past some of the better content in Destiny 2 without realizing it. Bungie has included a new \"adventure\" category of missions scattered around each location, and these are well worth seeing. While the main campaign typically makes you feel like you just arrived at a new location before you're being whisked off to the next one, the adventure missions help to flesh out and develop the characters and goings-on in a specific place.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c982af05-7840-47fe-b1f3-6439f2f25ece": {"__data__": {"id_": "c982af05-7840-47fe-b1f3-6439f2f25ece", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "8d7833cf-686c-4a4a-a8e3-af30c83571d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "47b01a106bb9c1da31c55484de6da17a84d85c121fdaa2a571ba751423ebf563"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4dff910-414e-4feb-aa9c-71a04366bd84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0319fc567a722420946aadeb83ed33b1ccf405e935520c25bb153abf6d9c30d"}}, "hash": "f72d636b383404d71b1fcebe9c3e565f10bdccd47ad596aec4d3b1b764c5e86b", "text": "Each one has unique voiceovers and little self-contained storylines, and many of them feature unique mechanics or take you to some really impressive-looking parts of each zone that you wouldn't necessarily run across otherwise. The problem is, the rewards for these missions are fixed and aren't especially valuable in light of all the other activities that yield gear much faster, so if you're doing a mix of Crucible, public events, and so forth along with the campaign, you can reach a point before you realize it where the adventures are no longer valuable from an upgrade perspective. It would have been nice to see these missions utilized in a way that feels more meaningful to your character progression, and I ended up solving this problem by, uh, starting a second character and making sure to step off the loot treadmill to stop and smell the roses once in a while. Though, if the arc of the first Destiny is any indication, there's a good chance Bungie will go in and find a way to draw more players into this sort of meaningful side content over time.Destiny 2 adds a tremendous number of quality-of-life improvements that should be a huge relief for long-suffering fans of the first game. You can now travel directly from planet to planet, rather than having to sit through one loading screen to return to orbit, then another one to fly to a new location. Unidentified loot engrams now go into their own inventory bucket rather than cluttering up your gear slots, and in a why-didn't-they-think-of-this-before move, the game now takes all the gear you possess in your inventory and vault into account when it generates new loot for you, rather than forcing you to tediously equip your highest-value stuff every time you go to decode an engram. Public events now show up on zone maps complete with a little timer telling you exactly when they'll start. And clans, which were worse than useless in the first game, are now a brilliant way not just to organize activities with friendly players, but to collectively contribute to group goals. Clans level up based on everything their members do in the game, unlocking little buffs and bonuses along the way. And in perhaps the most player-friendly change in all of Destiny 2, every week that a single clan fireteam completes a tough challenge like a Nightfall, raid, or Trials run, every clan member gets a piece of high-value, rare loot. The new clan system is a brilliant way to get people together for pickup activities and so forth. It's entirely possible I've had more social interaction in two weeks of playing Destiny 2 than I've had in calendar 2017 to date, which I hope says more about what a good time this game is with friends than it does about me.Perhaps the one mark on Destiny 2's record is its increased focus on microtransactions. The first game introduced paid cosmetic items and player emotes over time in a relatively inoffensive way, and that system returns here in an expanded capacity. There are way more and higher quality cosmetics than before, and you can actually earn a fair number of them for free just by playing the game (paying will only give you quite a few more of them faster). The one outrageous exception is the change to the shader system that previously let you dye all your gear the same color. On the upside, shaders can now be applied individually to each piece of armor, and also to every gun, sparrow, and ship in the game. On the downside, shaders are now single-use items that you'll need to grind to obtain more of... unless you pay real money to get them faster, and even then you may not get the ones you want. And this is in a game where you change gear constantly and will lose those shaders sooner than you'd like. It's a real shame to see Bungie regress a previously player-friendly customization system, seemingly in an effort to drive microtransactions.It goes without saying that Destiny's core shooting remains among the absolute best available on a console, but it's worth noting that the game's three classes and their three subclasses have been redesigned from the ground up to give you more interesting and consistent gameplay options. In contrast to Destiny's confusing grid of ability bubbles, the subclass skill trees here are easily legible and are all split into two branches, each of which has a unifying theme. So if you want a gameplay style that revolves around getting aerial kills, or one that lets you recover health in multiple ways, or one that just lets you punch the hell out of everything, you can have that. The perks on a lot of exotic gear seem tailored to further enhance specific subclasses, and there's also a fairly clever (if slightly confusing) new gear mod system that lets you add even more buffs to weapon handling, ability recharge rates, and so forth on each piece of gear.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4dff910-414e-4feb-aa9c-71a04366bd84": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4dff910-414e-4feb-aa9c-71a04366bd84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "c982af05-7840-47fe-b1f3-6439f2f25ece", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f72d636b383404d71b1fcebe9c3e565f10bdccd47ad596aec4d3b1b764c5e86b"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff603ef5-9f4d-4c52-bfa2-5c95971908da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4fc39e40ed21c42ab2c1b8af39d6bb05f9674145f2320329247b689976bab112"}}, "hash": "a0319fc567a722420946aadeb83ed33b1ccf405e935520c25bb153abf6d9c30d", "text": "You can even use gear mods to change out the damage type on elemental weapons. Speaking of weapons, the first game's primary/secondary/heavy system has given way to kinetic, energy, and power types. Now hand cannons and auto, scout, and pulse rifles can have elemental damage types and sit in both your first and second slots, letting you customize more thoroughly with weapon combinations you couldn't use before. Shotguns and sniper rifles now hang out in the power category along with rocket launchers and swords, which certainly makes them a less frequent annoyance in the Crucible, and the game seems to be more generous with power ammo in PVE activities, so you still get to use those weapons plenty there. Just about everything related to the combat in Destiny 2 feels more varied and thoughtful than it did in the first game.It shouldn't be surprising to say the look and feel of Destiny 2 more than lives up to Bungie's considerable pedigree, but that doesn't diminish the sheer artistic accomplishment of the game. Even as I found some of the new planetary locations conceptually less interesting than those of the first Destiny, I also lost count of the times my jaw dropped open at some perfectly framed scene or elaborately lit tableau, especially in the raid and some of the strikes. There's an increase in both the size and detail of the game's environments over the first Destiny, probably owing to the focus on current console hardware this time around, and the second-to-last mission of the campaign in particular features some of the most breathtaking and larger-than-life imagery I can ever remember in a game. And while I sorely miss Marty O'Donnell's signature percussion and the game could use a few more french horns, the Destiny 2 score has grown on me considerably over a few dozen hours. There are some really memorable themes in here, and the inclusion of the Kronos Quartet gives a couple of dramatic scenes some real emotional oomph.Like with any loot game, you'll eventually exhaust Destiny 2's content, but unlike the first Destiny, you'll likely feel a lot more satisfied when you do. The new raid, Leviathan, is much easier for new players to access in terms of gear requirements, and has an unexpected setting and some utterly wild visuals and moments, even though a couple of the encounters are infuriatingly inconsistent at the moment. Trials of the Nine has less stringent requirements than its incarnation in the first game as well, and if you play enough of it you might earn enough rep for an item or two even if you never manage to eke out seven consecutive wins. Bungie has also gotten better about communicating its roadmap for future content and is already teasing something called \"Faction Rally\" in the near future, and you can bet Iron Banner will worm its way back into the game some weekend soon. And this is all in advance of the first DLC pack coming in three months, which is rumored to contain an entire new planet to explore, provided you like this game enough to pay for more of it. That's the biggest success of this sequel: it's now good enough that you no longer need to make excuses about why you play so much Destiny. Destiny 2 may misstep in a couple of ways its predecessor didn't, but it also shores up its fundamentals so thoroughly that the future for Destiny fans looks bright indeed.\u00a9 2023 FANDOM, INC.

Practically every website covered Destiny 2 in September. Most people reading this probably already know that the story is nothing to write home about, and that the endgame leaves something to be desired for the most hardcore fans.The number of environments, weapons, activities, rewards and everything else around what you actually get up to in Destiny 2 is well documented in our Destiny 2 guide and hundreds of other places online.The praise and grievances are all relevant here, no less valid than they were at the console launch. Nothing on that end has changed; this is still the same game many played in September. So instead of wasting time rehashing old critique, I am keen to tell you about my experience as a PC player in a game ostensibly designed as a console shooter first. \n \nThe first thing that immediately hit me was the much higher frame-rate. Before I had time to properly judge weapon mechanics or how character movement feels on a keyboard, I was in awe of how smooth the game runs during quiet and hectic moments alike. I had no problems maxing out all settings at 1440p and averaging 120fps. Admittedly, it's a near-top-of-the-line PC, but you won't need much if you aim for 60fps.There is no question about the responsiveness upgrade you feel at higher frame-rates. Destiny 2 already felt great at 30fps, I would even argue it feels better than some 60fps shooters on consoles.But on PC, with frame-rates as high as your machine can pump out, the game is unshackled. Your inputs feel all the more tactile. Unloading the entire clip of a hand cannon, then throwing a grenade and dodging into a reload as a Hunter feels like some ideal version of Overwatch\u2019s McCree we never got. The precision of a mouse offers infinite utility, and much greater control. More than that, it opens up new avenues for you to appreciate and enjoy weapon classes Destiny players have been using in a certain way for years.A slow-firing auto rifle was something I often avoided on console. If I needed a low rate-of-fire precision weapon, I\u2019d use a scout rifle. On PC, I could easily turn this auto rifle into a scout rifle by tap-firing without losing any of the precision. Sure, a scout rifle will always have higher impact, but I had more control over something so small than I ever did on a controller.I worried hand cannons would be cumbersome and unnecessarily slow after playing the beta, but the sheer number of them in the full game negated this almost immediately. In fact, it made me appreciate some of the finer variances between the slow, classic revolver-style hand cannons and the more modern options. But gunplay isn\u2019t the only thing that feels great on PC. Character movement is similarly well adapted to keyboard\u2019s digital inputs. \n \nYour average Destiny session features a lot of platforming, and while the original game changed my mind on the point of having this at all in a first-person game, Destiny 2 convinced me that first-person platforming can still feel good without analogue inputs. This is a big deal; PC shooters for years have been struggling with the best way to implement first-person platforming. The old Half-Life nightmare level comes to mind.The games that figured this out \u2013 like Portal \u2013 had much less of an emphasis on combat. While Destiny 2 doesn't ask a lot of you in most firefights, pulling off cool moves is what keeps combat interesting. Platforming and air movement are big parts of that, and they must respect your momentum without feeling floaty and weightless \u2013 see Borderlands for the worst way to do this.None of these issues are anywhere to be found here. I deliberately picked a Warlock in the launch version because I remember hating its jump and air control on a pad. I still think it\u2019s the worst of the three classes in this regard, but I have never quite appreciated the reason for why Warlock jumps have so much glide until I played on PC. Perhaps through sheer luck or genius forward-thinking, the UI in Destiny was designed to work well with a mouse from the start. On console, you control what\u2019s essentially a big mouse cursor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43a3d0c8-dc9f-4df8-abf6-c2749a835abd": {"__data__": {"id_": "43a3d0c8-dc9f-4df8-abf6-c2749a835abd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff603ef5-9f4d-4c52-bfa2-5c95971908da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4fc39e40ed21c42ab2c1b8af39d6bb05f9674145f2320329247b689976bab112"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc62c79b-a963-4c0e-bf4c-e17c0bfd42c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f878145ab34c25821de64fc7fb423bbdad13839e5e6b3205cc701042a013d29e"}}, "hash": "06fad7d0fb0bad22b11517dc322cee375f1f17dbcea9a4e64cc6f999b2e690f4", "text": "On console, you control what\u2019s essentially a big mouse cursor. This translates well to PC, for the most part.Navigating a planet\u2019s map doesn\u2019t respond too well to the speed of a mouse. The camera pans at a speed typical of analogue sticks, and you can't use arrow or WASD keys to navigate it like some RTS games. It\u2019s not a big issue, but together with the unnecessary push towards holding buttons instead of pressing them, makes certain parts of the UI, such as checking the weekly Milestones, feel finicky.You\u2019ll quickly forget Destiny 2\u2019s roots as a console shooter once you get used to these quirks. The game plays just as well as any PC open-world shooter. Getting around the world is easy. Jumping off a Sparrow into a Public Event before getting lost trying to locate the chest you\u2019re hearing the chime for feels natural on mouse and keyboard. The incredibly fast load times (even on a regular HDD) means that even the in-orbit moments are cut to 20 or 30 seconds, and I never once hit the in-world loading issues I got so many times on consoles.  \n \nBungie always struck me as a developer too precious about the games it makes and the worlds within them. The old joke of capitalising every other word in dialogue still holds true. For all my time watching, playing, and covering Destiny, the studio\u2019s vision for everything within it - from the way the action feels, how rewards are doled out, and down to how stories are told - is one that\u2019s always been very specific. It was a surprise to see a studio that\u2019s so wrapped up in how its creations are perceived recognise that the needs and expectations of a whole new platform could mean that some of these beliefs will have to be abandoned. Let me be frank. The PC port of a game as a popular as Destiny would have probably sold just fine even if it was terrible. Taken a step further, a competent but otherwise lacking port accompanied by hollow claims about how the game should \"feel\" from Bungie would have still done well commercially. Destiny 2 on PC could have easily been just another console port that looks and runs a bit nicer than consoles, but doesn\u2019t really do any one thing well enough to truly feel at home on PC.So to see how far Bungie and Vicarious Visions have gone to make this a good PC shooter first, and a good port as well, tells me that nothing was off the table during development. And beyond that, it signifies a commitment to PC from the most unlikely places. \n \nDestiny 2 on PC is a completely different experience to the one on consoles, not just because of its technical implementation, but in how it feels when you do the things we\u2019ve been doing on consoles for years. Destiny 2 players on PS4 and Xbox One who are serious enough about the game need to consider migrating to PC. Technical analysis revealed that you can easily achieve 1080p/60fps on plenty of affordable hardware configurations.The game still plays great on a controller on PC, and no amount of exclusive content will matter when you see it running this well. Sure, you\u2019ll have to stomach the upfront cost of a PC, but I am willing to bet you\u2019ll find other uses for the new machine than just playing Destiny 2.Before the release of Destiny 2, PC players looking for a loot shooter had one of two options. Replay any of the Borderlands games, and suffer through plenty of samey drops and mediocre shooting mechanics.

I\u2019ve always been interested in the franchise, but I never play my Xbox in any meaningful capacity so I knew if I were to ever get my hands on the series, it would have to be on PC. It makes sense \u2014 both the loot-driven and FPS genres thrive on PC, so an amalgamation of the two feels right at home.I had some concerns about jumping into the second game without any knowledge of the first, but it\u2019s worked in the past so I figured it could work again here. While there are some high notes, I feel as if Destiny 2\u00a0mostly misses its mark.Destiny 2 (PC)Developer: BungiePublisher: ActivisionMSRP: $59.99Release Date: October 24, 2017I\u2019m honestly not completely sure what happens in Destiny 2\u2019s story.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ae3d3fa-96f8-4398-bc29-6c3c9e197c95": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ae3d3fa-96f8-4398-bc29-6c3c9e197c95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc62c79b-a963-4c0e-bf4c-e17c0bfd42c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f878145ab34c25821de64fc7fb423bbdad13839e5e6b3205cc701042a013d29e"}, "3": {"node_id": "fae6e65e-8ad2-4357-bcc9-bb89e5fa7db9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "02971815bf02f9581378a9bd19c93144233a29342a32b86499d49f7117250ec3"}}, "hash": "ab594c79529275418d9aa1d673745ff6291a0426a51f9ba86c8b9d16a77db022", "text": "Like, I get the gist of it and I always know what my character is supposed to be doing, but coming with no prior knowledge of the previous game left me with nothing but apathy for just about everything. There\u2019s a moment in the story where a character, as dramatically as possible, says \u201cGet me so-and-so and whatshername\u201d and then the cutscene ends. All I was left thinking was \u201cI bet that was dramatic and cool for people who know those characters.\u201dThat being said, even without any real knowledge of Destiny and its world, damn, does Destiny 2 know how to build to some incredible moments. I don\u2019t need to know anyone\u2019s motives to understand that playing around with unlimited light is an exhilarating moment. While most of the boss fights are more spongy than epic, there are smaller moments in the story that sticks out the most. Just as impressive are the tonal shifts, which Destiny 2 performs excellently. I felt some genuine dread while moving through the darker areas with my flashlight on.It\u2019s a bit sad to have gone through almost all of the content entirely alone, given the multiplayer-leaning design of the game itself. It\u2019s so strange to see so many people running around the hub world and out on the various planets and have no way to talk to them. Why do I need to use third-party websites to create an actual team? Why is there no general chat? I get mixed messages when I play in Destiny 2. It is structured like an MMORPG, but with none of the things that make the genre memorable.As a first-person shooter, it feels great. The different types of guns all have a distinct flavor, as do the unique weapons later on. But again, I feel like there are mixed messages being sent between the design and the gameplay. I\u2019m led to believe that there is more than just shooting here: a supercharged ability, class-specific abilities, and an entire skill tree to work through. When taking a closer look though, there\u2019s not much to separate this from most other FPS games. A grenade and melee attack with some quirky interactions is hardly what I would call interesting.This would be less of an issue if the cooldowns were shorter. It often feels as if Destiny 2 is a traditional FPS game until the big boss fights, at which point everyone just dumps their abilities into it until it dies. Outside of those larger fights, I would occasionally use my grenade when an appropriately grouped bunch of enemies presented itself. On the flip side, I often felt discouraged from using my melee attack; it was always tied with reducing the cooldown of things that were usually already up (I played primarily as a Warlock, I understand that this is not an issue with every class).Things start to get better in Strikes, which act as an end-game series of repeatable missions for teams of three. When players are rotating their ability usage, combat is much more fluid and fast-paced. Yet again, no one communicates. I\u2019ve typed things into the chat plenty of times and had no response from anyone. Most people seem pretty determined to blast through the content as quick as possible. I always seem to be on a team with those who cut every corner possible, which can be pretty off-putting, especially if you haven\u2019t done the Strike before. \u201cI guess we don\u2019t have to kill these guys\u2026\u201dThen again, the game almost demands that you zoom through the end-game stuff as fast as possible. After completing the story, it felt like a slog to increase my power (light) level. Since this power is tied to the player\u2019s armor and weapon levels, everything is loot dependent. \u201cLeveling up\u201d means nothing and is more of a progress indicator for the story missions. After reaching max level, gaining experience simply leads to receiving another bright engram, which is essentially a lootbox and, of course, you could also just pay for these. The game doesn\u2019t feel too skewed towards making the player feel as if they need to pay for them, but the temptation is constantly there. As Chris mentioned in his original review, it\u2019s not quite pay-to-win, but it\u2019s damn close.I enjoy a loot treadmill as much as the next person, but this feels awfully structured. From what I\u2019ve experienced, the loot players find that playing the missions is great for getting to the end-game, but after that, it\u2018s mostly vendor trash. Finding guns that increase the character\u2019s light level by one feels pitiful. It\u2019s the engrams that promise larger leaps.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fae6e65e-8ad2-4357-bcc9-bb89e5fa7db9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fae6e65e-8ad2-4357-bcc9-bb89e5fa7db9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ae3d3fa-96f8-4398-bc29-6c3c9e197c95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab594c79529275418d9aa1d673745ff6291a0426a51f9ba86c8b9d16a77db022"}, "3": {"node_id": "7236ba0c-781f-46c1-973c-ed2c34fd93db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "64506aa6de75e6ad6b7a5c9379737bf57d04ce0a018a1415010b2077e6b904c6"}}, "hash": "02971815bf02f9581378a9bd19c93144233a29342a32b86499d49f7117250ec3", "text": "It\u2019s the engrams that promise larger leaps. So players play Strikes as fast as possible to earn an engram or two, open it, and see if they become \u201cmore powerful.\u201d Sure, it\u2019s exciting to open up a legendary engram and find something badass, but it\u2019s equally deflating to open up a legendary engram and find something badass that you found five hours ago. Your progression is not tied to your performance, but instead tied to chance.I am also shoe-horned into using my strongest weapons all the time. For example, I have no interest in power weapons that aren\u2019t shotguns or swords. However, if I receive a rocket launcher that\u2019s +30 to my current sword, there\u2019s no reason for me to stay with the sword other than the fact that I like it more. I just need to hope that I find an equally powerful sword. It\u2019s rare that the weapons ever feel more damaging than a previous one \u2014 the number is just higher. My 240 power level sniper rifle is the same thing as my 100, except the number that pops out of the enemy is bigger this time. There are some innate weapon mods like quick-scoping, and also player-driven mods to make weapons better, but rarely do they make a significant impact on the weapon\u2019s feedback to the player.The PVP Crucible is another way to spend your end-game, but man, I\u2019m not sure why players would spend their time here. Given the cooldowns, PVP is essentially any other FPS game where the players occasionally throw out a sci-fi ability. It\u2019s an okay experience, but an all too familiar one, which is a letdown. I suppose the cooldowns help balance everything in the long run, but the end result is a par-for-the-course PVP experience.For me, it was all about the \u201cAdventures\u201d and Public Events. Adventures are essentially side-quests that pop up around the various planets and feel way more natural. This has been my go-to content outside of the story missions. They get reset and can be replayed, but unless you\u2019re a super-hardcore player you likely won\u2019t feel the need to constantly play the same Adventures over and over again \u2014 there are enough to keep things varied. Public Events are just that \u2013 events that anyone on the planet (in your instance, at least) can cooperate in and gather some loot. It can feel weird to do the same mission time and time again, but it\u2019s not as farfetched or as boring as other repeatable missions, and again, they feel more natural. These two things are what keep me coming back to Destiny 2.The PC version runs incredibly well. I have never seen the framerate drop below 60 (cutscenes are locked at 30), and generally rests at around 70-90. The environments look absolutely stunning; there were multiple times where I simply stopped what I was doing just to look around. Likewise, the soundtrack to Destiny 2 is phenomenal. Why haven\u2019t more people brought this up? The brilliant score hits all the right notes and makes those aforementioned incredible moments even more memorable.There are definitely some weird, probably console-driven decisions in here. It can take forever to get rid of your excess inventory by dismantling. Players need to hold the F key while mousing over the item, which slides the next item into that slot as the first item disappears. To dismantle that item, however, the mouse has to leave it and come back. Every time. Why can\u2019t I ctrl-click a group of items and dismantle them all at once? Also, why the heck doesn\u2019t the map screen start centered around my character?I was glad to see a colorblind mode included, but it doesn\u2019t address my biggest color issue: the weapon element colors. Each sub-weapon comes with an element: solar, void, and arc (or, as I know them, firey, circle-stuff, and spiky-ball). Certain enemies have an appropriately colored shield (red, purple, light blue) that need to be hit with the appropriate elemental weapon for easy disposal. Problem is, I can\u2019t tell the difference between the void and arc colors, especially not mid-firefight. I essentially just hope for the best when shooting either of those two shields.Destiny 2 is an incredibly competent shooter that lacks a strong identity. Just when I think I understand what it\u2019s going for, some off-brand design decision comes into play that shows me I\u2019m wrong.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7236ba0c-781f-46c1-973c-ed2c34fd93db": {"__data__": {"id_": "7236ba0c-781f-46c1-973c-ed2c34fd93db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "fae6e65e-8ad2-4357-bcc9-bb89e5fa7db9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "02971815bf02f9581378a9bd19c93144233a29342a32b86499d49f7117250ec3"}, "3": {"node_id": "75dda389-09a5-4f71-8842-9f5fadc4898f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "682c80a93b00edb7bedefc31cb72162d1c843a36f3b871e93c497c9cbe3b9081"}}, "hash": "64506aa6de75e6ad6b7a5c9379737bf57d04ce0a018a1415010b2077e6b904c6", "text": "PC players who missed out on the first game will likely have no interest in the actual story, but the missions are varied and exciting enough to be worthwhile.

I had just experienced challenging platforming across broken walkways, fights through dark, suffocating passages, traversing rigs anchored above unnaturally large waves, and a suspension bridge battle complete with wave after wave of enemies. All to turn on the power.This was just one of several missions that you will encounter over the course of the Destiny 2 campaign, and it didn\u2019t hold back at all; a summary for this hotly anticipated sequel as a whole. An absolute surprise considering I had put more than 30 hours into the original, only to realize it just wasn\u2019t for me.A long-time Halo fan, I wanted to see Bungie be successful on its own two feet, but the first game just didn\u2019t cut it. Coupled with playing the first two of three tutorial missions at E3, I was very skeptical of Destiny 2. Everything looked and felt like more of the same, just with the addition of a number.However, it was through those opening missions that Destiny 2 took the time to prove that it means business. The story \u2013 and yes, there is an actual story \u2013 begins with the Tower social hub from Destiny being attacked by a new faction of Cabal called the Red Legion.We\u2019ll keep this relatively spoiler-free, but these first three missions play out as a symbolic passing of the torch as you witness the subsequent destruction of what you once knew and the emotional, even painful beginning of something else entirely.Having done the first two missions once already, I was eager to rush through, but the third and final tutorial mission accomplished its feat of forcing me to slow down and pay attention. It was the first sign that Destiny 2 is something entirely different from its predecessor.This carried on through the entirety of the campaign, gripping me in a way that only Bungie\u2019s former series Halo was able to.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75dda389-09a5-4f71-8842-9f5fadc4898f": {"__data__": {"id_": "75dda389-09a5-4f71-8842-9f5fadc4898f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "7236ba0c-781f-46c1-973c-ed2c34fd93db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "64506aa6de75e6ad6b7a5c9379737bf57d04ce0a018a1415010b2077e6b904c6"}, "3": {"node_id": "91f8d98d-ae8c-4c67-a1ad-f882351e13c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d691b9d4ca1517516b44a40ed203d64dbf03eba4adaad8f92bfd1f5db568b3e2"}}, "hash": "682c80a93b00edb7bedefc31cb72162d1c843a36f3b871e93c497c9cbe3b9081", "text": "There were so many moments that shocked and awed me, including numerous cutscenes that brought meaning to the narrative and an actually fleshed out villain.That isn\u2019t to say that it doesn\u2019t have its flaws, though. Once the game opens up to its first major area where you can explore and go on side missions, there is a sort of disconnect between the main campaign and everything else there. I found out very quickly that it\u2019s best to ignore the new Adventure missions and the like that are there purely as filler content.These side quests are monotonous and a bore to accomplish, lacking the heart that fills the campaign. At the beginning, it\u2019s best to not try to complete everything on the map, as it does nothing except grant XP and kill the vibe. However, what does work are the public events that occur.These only happen every once in a while and last just a few moments, but there\u2019s joy to be found in being drawn to the same centralized spot as strangers and completing a difficult task together. It also helps that the environments you\u2019ll be visiting are stunning, from the grassy woodlands of the European Dead Zone to chained-together platforms stationed on endless water to a hidden desolate wasteland-turned-paradise.Destiny 2 is just as visual pleasing as it is to play. Bungie are masters of gun-play and it\u2019s no different here. The much needed quality-of-life improvements like removing the trio of primary, special, and heavy weapons in favor of the less restrictive categories of kinetic, energy, and power weapons are much appreciated. This is in addition to more plentiful ammo, smarter enemy AI, and more accessible multiplayer.You gain access to the Crucible as early as level two, allowing you to jump into both quickplay and competitive matches of four versus four. Crucible is virtually unchanged, minus the addition of some new maps and a couple of new modes. It isn\u2019t a total blunder, but it\u2019s disappointing that it didn\u2019t get the same love that the singleplayer had been given.Countdown is an interesting addition, giving a condensed version of Battlefield\u2019s Rush, where two teams take turns planting bombs and defending points. It breaks up the usual cycle of modes like Control or Clash, but it also brings attention to the Crucible\u2019s most glaring issues.The new maps are all rather small and confined. This in and of itself isn\u2019t so bad, but it causes multiplayer to be non-stop action. This means there is no downtime for you to strategize or catch your breath. It alleviates the dreaded campers, but it also eliminates any sort of natural ebb and flow that is crucial to online multiplayer.On the opposite end of the multiplayer spectrum, cooperative modes like Strikes have improved greatly. Strikes are set to a playlist much like the Crucible where it queues you up with other players and immediately sends you on the mission. The several available Strikes at launch are vastly different in design.Though all Destiny 2 Strikes end one way or another in a huge boss battle, the journey to that point is unique. The levels vary from narrow passages to open battlefields, with more than a few surprises I won\u2019t spoil. The boss battles themselves are multi-layered affairs, including sub-objectives that must be completed in order to win.To complete a Strike in Destiny 2, though, the playlist is locked behind a wall that requires you to be a certain level and more than halfway through the story. It isn\u2019t the only feature that is locked behind a significant amount of playtime, as there are several like this, including rather simple ones like challenges (think bounties). This can be frustrating, as the game forces you to grind on several occasions to access new areas, features, and even the story.Thankfully, the overall character progression in Destiny 2 is generous, granting you endless amounts of loot from enemies and mission rewards. Even the ever elusive Exotic weapons and armor are granted occasionally, allowing you to adequately prepare ahead of time for the endgame content.Speaking of endgame content, we waited to post our final review in eager anticipation for the Leviathan raid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91f8d98d-ae8c-4c67-a1ad-f882351e13c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "91f8d98d-ae8c-4c67-a1ad-f882351e13c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "75dda389-09a5-4f71-8842-9f5fadc4898f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "682c80a93b00edb7bedefc31cb72162d1c843a36f3b871e93c497c9cbe3b9081"}, "3": {"node_id": "dc36a6cc-2b49-498c-9e01-91c238d5b195", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b3c995ae749ac03f2fbd693b6855120832e440c1bc25c5ace6718af4804b77f"}}, "hash": "d691b9d4ca1517516b44a40ed203d64dbf03eba4adaad8f92bfd1f5db568b3e2", "text": "We\u2019ve posted our full impressions for that here, but the short of it is that Destiny 2 is notable for having enough content at the end to last you for months to come.The Raid coupled with all of the level 20 quests, Adventures (which are much more fun to complete after the story instead of during), the endless Crucible, Milestones, and many, many hours of grinding towards the power cap supplies everything you need to get hundreds of hours of play out of just what the base game offers.The content doesn\u2019t end there, as Bungie has already detailed even more content to come like Trials, the return of the Iron Banner, and the leaked first expansion called Curse of Osiris.

The hype was astronomical, and the first preview event didn\u2019t even have a playable build. What we actually ended up getting was a very strong shooter with a weak RPG backbone, a foundation that was slowly built up over the course of several years.Destiny 2\u00a0still isn\u2019t the game that was described to us ages ago when the hype train began, but at this point, it\u2019s good enough if you\u2019re looking for an action shooter.Destiny 2\u00a0(PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: BungiePublisher: ActivisionRelease Date: September 6, 2017 (consoles), October 24, 2017 (PC)MSRP: $59.99The chief improvement in the sequel is that Bungie went out of its way to make everything less of a chore. General tweaks have been made that place an emphasis on just roaming around and having fun, and are akin to Blizzard\u2019s lauded complete rework of Diablo III with \u201cLoot 2.0.\u201d\u00a0While doing patrols in the past and happening upon public events that you\u2019d find off of a third-party website felt like a tedious grind in the first game, now it\u2019s desirable (and visible on-screen), both in terms of loot and for showing off where the game nails it the most \u2014 combat.Everything is flashier and more functional in Destiny 2. Instead of sticking with a tried and true subclass, I loved experimenting with all three for Warlock, Titan, and Hunter, trying new combos out with friends and trying to synergize class abilities. The end result is that everyone has more utility, and there\u2019s less room for cookie-cutter builds (though they\u2019ll still exist when the raid rolls around). It took years, but they\u2019re pretty close to getting balance right.Even the story has more panache, which mostly works in its favor. Sure it might basically be a re-telling of several Star Wars beats, but it\u2019s easy to follow and even easier to get invested in, with the game\u2019s cast coming front and center. Every performance, including Lance Reddick\u2019s Zavala and Nathan Fillion\u2019s Cayde-6, feel less phoned in, and some of the newcomers have already cemented their place in the Destiny\u00a0universe.You\u2019re still going to get a few low points just like the first, there\u2019s no escaping that.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc36a6cc-2b49-498c-9e01-91c238d5b195": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc36a6cc-2b49-498c-9e01-91c238d5b195", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "91f8d98d-ae8c-4c67-a1ad-f882351e13c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d691b9d4ca1517516b44a40ed203d64dbf03eba4adaad8f92bfd1f5db568b3e2"}, "3": {"node_id": "27fd312f-e1ca-468f-8ee7-2a4cf1fd2531", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ae8df08fdae5bf06be2414584e342601c01f270f4ce5453606cba819a2b3704"}}, "hash": "2b3c995ae749ac03f2fbd693b6855120832e440c1bc25c5ace6718af4804b77f", "text": "A few quests are almost exactly the same, the enemies are mostly the same as the original, and there\u2019s a ton of re-used assets and re-used areas even within scenarios unique to Destiny 2\u00a0(the Nightfall for the first week is almost entirely re-purposed hub zones). But again, everything just flows so much better here, as you can level up and earn satisfying levels of loot through PVP, dungeons, or open world play. No longer do I feel obligated to stick to one planet to level, as I frequently found myself hopping between all four and joining in on public events just for the hell of it.Planets, mind, that are vastly improved both from a lore perspective and in terms of personality. There\u2019s a lot more meaningful jaunts to happen upon, and the rolling tides of Titan feel like a legitimate spectacle now that the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are long gone (even though the last Destiny\u00a0expansion shirked them, their footprint was still apparent). Everything is more manageable and digestible too. \u201cMeditations\u201d allow you to repeat story missions (gone is the annoying icon-filled map), challenges are linked to activities like Strikes, and patrols are back. Instead of earning useless Motes of Light after you reach the level cap of 20, you\u2019ll now unlock \u201cBright Engrams,\u201d which provide a heap of cosmetic and gameplay upgrades.It\u2019s a double-edged sword, because of course, they\u2019re linked to microtransactions. While some of you are going to be pissed that these glorified lore-disguised loot crates exist at all, you\u2019ll probably be even more angry at the fact that you can get weapon and armor mods from Bright Engrams \u2014 mods that directly impact gameplay and make your equipment marginally better. Shaders being downgraded to a single-use classification also stings.Based on my experience it hasn\u2019t ruined the game in a meaningful way, but it uncomfortably flirts with pay-to-win, and feels straight up over the line. I think Bungie needs to go back on it as soon as possible in fact, as they\u2019ve ruined so much good will from the original Destiny, which only dealt in cosmetics. As a premium game with a season pass (and likely more paid content beyond that, as was the case with Destiny), it\u2019s far less excusable.Destiny 2 commits a lot of the same sins as its father, but it succeeded in doing something the original never did \u2014 make roaming around the open world fun and rewarding. It still has a lot of room to evolve with expansions and major updates, but the future is looking brighter than it once was.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher. My Warlock\u2019s Power Level at the time of the review is 270, my Titan and Hunter completed the story, and the Nightfall was completed.

Bungie, creators of Halo, had pulled a second rabbit out of its hat. In the last three years, Destiny has become a hugely influential shooter, despite managing to trip over itself nearly every step of the way.Destiny 2 was a chance for a reset. An opportunity for Bungie to stop and take stock of the last few years and consider what worked and what didn\u2019t in the original. The final result is a game that has improved upon itself in almost every way, trimming fat and bolstering weak points. But as ever, it\u2019s hard not to want more from Destiny 2, as what we get just doesn\u2019t quite feel like enough in many ways.While Destiny 2 allows players to port their Guardians from their original game to this new one, that\u2019s all you\u2019re allowed to bring over. Everything you own, every currency, every weapon, every piece of armor is destroyed. Literally destroyed, as the famed Last City and its protective Tower are laid to waste by Cabal invaders. They\u2019re led by Ghaul, a commander who wants to take the immortal gift of the city\u2019s giant space orb, the Traveler\u2019s light, and acquire its power for himself. The Traveler is caged, Guardians lose their light, and it\u2019s up to us, one single Guardian out of thousands, to crawl our way back to our former glory, reuniting our old mentors to reclaim the city, and the light, from Ghaul.If most of that sounded nonsensical, that\u2019s understandable. Destiny has struggled to create a cohesive narrative with its use of nebulous concepts like \u201cLight\u201d and \u201cDarkness\u201d as major forces in the universe, but the sequel does manage to improve on the story of the original, which was ten times more bizarre than what I just described. I\u2019ve played the original Destiny\u2019s story probably 20 times by repeating missions, and I still probably cannot accurately tell you what happened there, or why.Destiny 2 is different. Though the story is somewhat generic, you must rally the troops to take down a big bad, it\u2019s at least coherent, and often well-told, relying on the voicework of sci-fi staples Gina Torres, Lance Reddick and Nathan Fillion as the members of the Vanguard, Ikora, Zavala and Cayde-6 respectively. The game also introduces quirky new side characters, a glitchy AI, a stoic sniper, a skeptical resistance fighter, who manage to actually be some of the more interesting NPCs in the game by the end, once you\u2019ve fleshed them out with a variety of story and side missions. The weakest link in the chain remains your own Guardian, who used to have a handful of lines in the original game, but now has zero, and only your Nolan North-voiced Ghost does the talking for you, which grows tiresome after the first few cutscenes that have you standing around in awkward silence while a blinking tetrahedron speaks on your behalf.Destiny 2Stripped of your power and gear, the hunt to reclaim both begins all over again.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d301e1fa-16bf-402e-b014-a62539205ca7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d301e1fa-16bf-402e-b014-a62539205ca7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "27fd312f-e1ca-468f-8ee7-2a4cf1fd2531", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ae8df08fdae5bf06be2414584e342601c01f270f4ce5453606cba819a2b3704"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5a6e6ef-0696-4c98-8d7d-0b37ecfac8c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "18a649db1d37250232766af2220b840538f21f9aa1a190f2e2e56a54e79f55e9"}}, "hash": "825c758b0750e87f7cbf0bc8988924f12321f0f49d1520e8ec526833dee388cc", "text": "Soon you will reclaim at least some fraction of your lost light, allowing you to use \u201cspace magic\u201d once again and try out one of the game\u2019s new subclasses, which will have you throwing flaming swords as a Warlock, using a crackling electric staff as a Hunter, or marauding around with a Captain America-like shield as a Titan. The new subclasses are fun, as are tweaks to the old ones, but one major area in which Destiny 2 is lacking is the absence of a new fully-fledged class, an odd move for an RPG sequel where that would usually be mandatory. And even the new subclasses are killing off old ones they\u2019re replacing, and many closely resemble others that already exist in the game.Still, that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t fun to use, and combined with Bungie\u2019s eternally top-notch gunplay, Destiny 2 is one of the tightest-performing shooters in the market. This has been the series\u2019 strength from the start, and while not much has changed from the original in this regard, not much needed to. The simple act of a headshot, of an enemy-blasting super move, of an unloaded shotgun clip into a boss\u2019s ribcage feels better than in any genre equivalent. Destiny runs circles around its rivals in this department, as it allows you, the player, to feel supremely powerful at all times, a singular thresher maw of destruction from start to finish. The game's expert gunplay also translates into a more refined PvP system, which shifts the focus away from one or two power weapons and allows for more competitive, diverse play through the game's new dual primary loadouts, something I initially hated, but gradually understood to be an improvement. It's taken PvP from a mode I mostly avoided to something I actively seek out to mix up gameplay.Part of Destiny 2\u2019s narrative improvements are linked to the structure of the game, which blends story missions, side-adventures and frequent cutscenes to move the story forward. The earlier sections are some of the game\u2019s most memorable, as you track through a frozen wasteland with only a single pistol to defend yourself against pursuing War Hounds as a heartbreaking orchestral soundtrack plays. Destiny 2\u2019s score is one of its crowning achievements, a haunting, thrilling tracklist that will stay with you long after stop playing.Players will trek across four new zones, the European Dead Zone on earth, the moons of Titan and Io, and the planetoid of Nessus. The EDZ is a hugely, sprawling area that is easily two or three times as big as any zone in Destiny 1. Yet, Titan, in contrast, is more or less only two open play areas with a bunch of branching hallways used mainly for missions and not general exploration. The size disparity across the zones is significant, but unlike the lack of any new character classes, at least this sequel did create four truly new zones rather than continuing to build on old assets like the first game did for years. Patrol mode in each of these areas now integrates almost all the activities of the game and is the most improved aspect of the sequel as you can hunt down hidden chests, fight secret bosses in Lost Sectors and participate in rewarding (possibly too rewarding) public events in your eternal quest for loot.Destiny 2But even with brand new activities found in these zones, the enemies that populate them area nearly identical to what we\u2019ve seen before. All five of Destiny\u2019s races return, the Fallen, Hive, Vex, Cabal and the Taken, the last of which is an amalgam of the first four, and one I hoped we\u2019d leave behind. Only the Cabal adds more than one or two new types of fighters to their roster, and everyone else has to be content with minor tweaks. This creates a rather weird experience in Destiny 2, where you can easily be the same subclass using the same exotics fighting the same enemies that you were in Destiny 1. In those moments, the claims that Destiny 2 is really Destiny 1.5 feel like they hold true.In some ways, however, Destiny 2 adds by subtraction. I am frankly amazed by just how streamlined Destiny 2 made its economy compared to the first game. Staples of the old Destiny, planetary materials, strange coins, ammo synths, exotic shards, motes of light, have either been eliminated or had their role greatly reduced. No longer do you have to do anything to upgrade weapons or armor, as all drop with set, unchanging perks that are instantly unlocked the moment the item drops.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5a6e6ef-0696-4c98-8d7d-0b37ecfac8c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5a6e6ef-0696-4c98-8d7d-0b37ecfac8c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "d301e1fa-16bf-402e-b014-a62539205ca7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "825c758b0750e87f7cbf0bc8988924f12321f0f49d1520e8ec526833dee388cc"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7a26ce5-bc89-436c-b504-d494b0558d48", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f07638994751cdc70bb9751694f3d123572cb9dda01f30a654e7521f326abd68"}}, "hash": "18a649db1d37250232766af2220b840538f21f9aa1a190f2e2e56a54e79f55e9", "text": "Every vendor is now based on a \u201ctoken\u201d system where running strikes, playing Crucible, doing patrol, dismantling guns will let you turn in specific tokens to assigned NPCs to get yourself 1-2 pieces of legendary loot as you slowly increase your power level. It\u2019s incredibly straightforward, and I would argue a vast improvement over the original, which had a mess of bounties, objectives and currencies that over-complicated everything the deeper you got into the game. The addition of Bright Engrams to the real-life-money Eververse store has been a point of contention, but given the rate in which you can earn them in-game without paying, and their complete focus on cosmetics, the concept does not appear to be anything that significantly hamstrings the game in the pursuit of greater revenue. But we\u2019ll have to see how the system expands in time, like it did in D1.What these changes will mean for the endgame is a bit less clear. This week, Destiny 2 opened up its two endgame activities, a new 6-man Leviathan raid and ultra-competitive PvP, Trials of the Nine. Both are challenging in different ways, with Leviathan being arguably the most complicated raid in the game\u2019s history and 100x the difficulty of anything you\u2019ll encounter in story mode. Destiny\u2019s endgame usually revolves around running these activities multiple times indefinitely, but the streamlining changes make me wonder if that will still happen this time around. Exotics drop like candy through frequent play (I have almost a full collection of exotic guns after just two weeks), and the changes to Legendaries, where all guns of the same name drop with the same perks, makes farming the \u201cperfect\u201d roll on your favorite weapon obsolete. So for these endgame activities, once you have X gun or X piece of armor, that\u2019s it. Duplicates serve no purpose. While I don\u2019t particularly mind this as I have too many other games to play to sink 2,000 hours into grinding for perfect drops in Destiny 2, I feel like die-hard players may run into a wall pretty quickly as it\u2019s incredibly easy to amass most of the best gear in the game in short order with this new system.Destiny 2Still, I think these changes are for the better. Destiny 2, from its story to its gameplay systems, is a much more coherent experience than the original in almost every way. Combine that with its rock-solid gameplay, and you have a recipe for a sequel that takes several dramatic steps forward for the series, even if it remains weirdly stuck in place in a few areas like classes and enemy types.I have had nothing but fun with Destiny 2 in the last two weeks. When my most major complaint is that I just wanted more from it, that implies what is there is thoroughly worthwhile. I wish Bungie had more time to build even more into Destiny 2, but what they have added is great, and what they\u2019ve taken away also makes for a better experience, for the most part (I\u2019ve avoided a consumable shader rant for this entire review, somehow).It\u2019s hard to imagine that Destiny 2 won\u2019t satisfy fans of the original, but it\u2019s also the type of game that will allow new players to jump right in, and skip some of the worst growing pains of the series. While there\u2019s still room for improvement, and for this universe to live up to its full potential, Destiny 2 makes undeniable progress, and reinforces the idea that this is a series we\u2019ll be playing for at least an entire decade, when all is said and done.Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One (later PC)Developer: BungiePublisher: ActivisionRelease Date: September 6, 2017Price: $59.99Score: 9/10Follow me\u00a0on Twitter\u00a0and\u00a0on Facebook.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7a26ce5-bc89-436c-b504-d494b0558d48": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7a26ce5-bc89-436c-b504-d494b0558d48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "723c922bcb8963018d65086a9f7bbbfaec5588d69bba783cac71bb64fdb24ff9"}, "2": {"node_id": "f5a6e6ef-0696-4c98-8d7d-0b37ecfac8c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "18a649db1d37250232766af2220b840538f21f9aa1a190f2e2e56a54e79f55e9"}}, "hash": "f07638994751cdc70bb9751694f3d123572cb9dda01f30a654e7521f326abd68", "text": "Pick up my sci-fi novel series,\u00a0The Earthborn Trilogy, which is now in print, online and on\u00a0audiobook., nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"1e1bcd16-1343-456a-8c27-5ef062489670": {"node_ids": ["9e306309-152d-4de9-a812-a7a43cadb4df", "6f6d13c7-91cd-4558-8325-a4040a677278", "f871d1b0-da81-41f4-bfb2-d9b24cfc0e8a", "9fceebee-7856-4e6d-a9f7-eab8038c3421", "293fcc51-7a31-4902-bd04-8e95158856ea", "472baaf3-1eba-46a5-b631-e4b82ab7d64c", "2fde33b9-7dee-4dd1-be45-487c87992516", "e6c65ffa-b1d0-48f3-bfb7-9fb3a1eb3808", "67792303-93f2-475f-ac84-d5527c9d6217", "f9c9822d-6dbf-4753-91bd-7848bda9547e", "e3609a85-dbc9-4953-b2cf-f4fbbacf732e", "ace7598c-a01b-4949-9a93-75296a244fec", "a25d5d05-804f-432c-b008-7cc7e3371daa", "a8df96ad-f092-4f43-82e2-6ddc2e90cdff", "9a3b8b71-aef0-4919-9b60-c7bb369e0552", "a588155c-2ac0-413e-9406-b1573e77c0c8", "6cad791b-411c-4669-bddd-15ddb71d7b1d", "057c944f-3b78-4ff6-8055-be96d0887dff", "3d34a3f8-2961-415d-a1a9-7099d14af3dd", "fffb016f-588d-4840-b763-f941206598f4", "14d0eebc-95ec-4921-8f1d-3a1fa9fa9ad4", "9cf34493-8dee-4234-aac9-b7f5a45b0410", "b16b79f2-e162-47ec-a68f-60d35cde10a7", "8de47afa-4a58-40e9-9616-3bc2948af09e", "6c08832a-b396-44b0-8bef-cb9b267e81c0", "e81175fa-f0ce-4d5b-9209-2a1f0a528838", "d5695f0a-a8ad-4a94-bfed-d0e09e7a116b", "72c71020-1dd3-423a-9fde-713ca2a59bba", "43d378bf-0183-45f2-8884-8da7b11cc02b", "8d7833cf-686c-4a4a-a8e3-af30c83571d3", "c982af05-7840-47fe-b1f3-6439f2f25ece", "d4dff910-414e-4feb-aa9c-71a04366bd84", "ff603ef5-9f4d-4c52-bfa2-5c95971908da", "43a3d0c8-dc9f-4df8-abf6-c2749a835abd", "dc62c79b-a963-4c0e-bf4c-e17c0bfd42c6", "2ae3d3fa-96f8-4398-bc29-6c3c9e197c95", "fae6e65e-8ad2-4357-bcc9-bb89e5fa7db9", "7236ba0c-781f-46c1-973c-ed2c34fd93db", "75dda389-09a5-4f71-8842-9f5fadc4898f", "91f8d98d-ae8c-4c67-a1ad-f882351e13c1", "dc36a6cc-2b49-498c-9e01-91c238d5b195", "27fd312f-e1ca-468f-8ee7-2a4cf1fd2531", "d301e1fa-16bf-402e-b014-a62539205ca7", "f5a6e6ef-0696-4c98-8d7d-0b37ecfac8c5", "c7a26ce5-bc89-436c-b504-d494b0558d48"], "metadata": {}}}}
