The Mandalorian has gotten too cheesy in its third season, the Boba Fett and Obi-Wan shows were toothless side stories, and enthusiasm around the next wave of movies feels, at best, muted. Jedi: Survivor bucks this trend. It's one of the best things to happen to the series in years, and easily the best modern Star Wars game.At a glance Jedi: Survivor seems like it falls squarely on the pulpy, safer side of Star Wars\u2014the gifted jedi with untapped potential, faithful droid companion, and swashbuckling crew certainly paint that picture, but there's more to Cal Kestis. Jedi: Survivor doesn't shy away from the darkest chapter of Star Wars history, finds humor in an unfair world, and sometimes succumbs to helplessness.It's not a story about fighting the Empire as much as coping with its dominance, grappling with the futility of rebellion, and questioning what's left to fight for. The modern Star Wars media that this feels closest to is Andor, though it's not as ambitious in its storytelling or as cynical. Unfortunately, those themes take a backseat through the middle of the story while Cal Kestis and crew entertain the deranged tantrums of a skin-deep evil guy with a red lightsaber, reminding us that this is still Uncharted in space.\u00a0But man, is it damn good space Uncharted. Better, in fact, because Jedi: Survivor breaks free of the Naughty Dog trends 2019's Fallen Order chased. Yes, Cal climbs up crumbling buildings and swings on ropes (especially in the opening hours), but he also double jumps, air dashes, wallruns, and grapple hooks all over the place. There's an almost equal ratio of combat to platforming, and both things are fun this time.\u00a0Jedi: Survivor revisits an era when third-person action games were designed like jungle gyms\u2014bottomless death pits flanked by that special kind of wall you can climb on, platforms that move for no reason at all, floating balloons that slingshot you across the sky. Respawn has resurrected the big-budget 3D platformer, and it's glorious.Much of Jedi: Survivor's platformer spirit is felt in its hub world of Koboh, a frontier planet in the midst of a turf war between stormtroopers and raiders wielding reprogramed prequel droids. You might be surprised to find out that half (if not more) of the game takes place on Koboh, but that's because it's packing multiple full-sized levels, side quests, secret areas, puzzle rooms, and optional boss battles. It's deep, wide, and technically an open world, but not a boundless sandbox. It's more like a collection of linear levels connected to a central area like spokes on a wheel\u2014a PS2-style platformer without the loading screens, essentially.The only thing Jedi: Survivor's missing are trails of floating gems or coins to draw my eye to optional areas. Instead, Respawn has made a dozen-or-so sidequests and bounty hunts that take you to lesser-explored corners of the map. Sometimes the quests come with a bit of story setup from a Koboh local, but they're often just a tip to go cave diving for treasure or a heads up about a particularly nasty droid on the loose. Rewards are usually underwhelming perks like \"more block meter\", a new pair of pants, or tiny health bar upgrades, but Koboh's mini dungeons and environmental puzzles are fun enough that I sought them out constantly.I did enjoy playing dress up with Cal, though. He has expanded his horizons beyond ponchos, and can how be fitted with any combination of shirts, jackets, pants, and hairstyles. Similarly, Cal's lightsaber, blaster, and BD-1 himself can be customized with dozens of different parts and materials.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4f1b1be-95bd-4a5d-b718-b437aaaf25e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4f1b1be-95bd-4a5d-b718-b437aaaf25e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "654846a7-f4cf-4ae2-9790-67501e70f6c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "89c8a777035cd9e12c682a872e67eeb718d389c4bc8880f733e804532d7920a0"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b3e3818-6315-4189-90fa-5f2a9334ad69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e446e9f6ec1ebae07103d789db47c152d760cfcdef9cafe0ae4eec20921a433d"}}, "hash": "102d11d954755008d45bf50b94616bc968bed0ffdac36924722aee0b6ee08331", "text": "The details are immaculate and I'm sure a bigger Star Wars fan than me will find a specific a middle chunk lightsaber piece and recognize an obscure reference, but I found a setup I liked early on and rarely changed it, which speaks to a general loot problem in Jedi: Survivor. You never know if the next chest Cal opens is holding a permanant upgrade, new ears for BD-1, or a handlebar mustache.\u00a0Some of my favorite Jedi: Survivor moments came from poking around a side path on my way to the bigger mission. I was always on the hunt for these little purple rifts that teleport Cal to a dream-like world for platforming or combat challenges. Here, Respawn's level design drops the Uncharted act in favor of Neon White\u2014crucibles of timed jumps, dashes, and grapple skills that push Jedi: Survivor's remarkably fun platforming chops to the extreme. Respawn has come a long way from Fallen Order's lethargic moveset.A big reason getting around is so fun is that backtracking is extremely easy. In Fallen Order, the frequency of return trips meant I had to go through the same fights and clamber through the same locations four or five times. Jedi: Survivor speeds things up with fast travel between checkpoints and way more shortcuts.Maybe too many shortcuts, actually. You'll find a new one every five to ten minutes, almost always in the form of a zipline or rope. They're so ubiquitous that you essentially never have to repeat any significant climb twice. Shortcuts are undeniably convenient for cleaning up sidequests, but their overuse makes the spaces between them feel artificial and somewhat arbitrary.The one aspect of Jedi: Survivor that hasn't been reimagined, but didn't really need to be, is combat. It has been enhanced, though, and is even better now that droids are in the mix. Cal has gotten a lot more lethal with a saber in the five year time skip\u2014limbs are chopped off from heavy attacks (troopers and droids alike), giant bugs can be entirely bisected, and sometimes Cal will unholster his blaster for a finishing execution that I assume he learned watching John Wick.I'm impressed at how Respawn has managed to make what is essentially the same saber feel like five distinct weapons.Oh right, Cal has a blaster now. It's one of the two saber stances new to Jedi: Survivor for a total of five: single saber, double-sided saber, dual saber, blaster, and crossguard. I'm impressed at how Respawn has managed to make what is essentially the same saber feel like five distinct weapons\u2014each stance has a unique moveset, its own upgrade tree and inherent tradeoffs. The double-sided saber's long reach, for instance, makes it the undisputed king of crowd control but doesn't hit as hard. Dual sabers deal a lot of damage quickly, but you have to commit to long combos that expose Cal's flanks. Crossguard stance (the Kylo Ren one) is basically a medieval claymore: devastating chops and cleaves that take a long wind up to connect.I ended up maining the blaster and crossguard stance for the majority of the game because they were easily the most fun to experiment with. The blaster stance in particular feels so delightfully un-Star Wars. Half of your attacks become ranged and you replenish blaster ammo by dealing saber damage. The saber attacks in blaster mode mimic fencing moves, which don't hit as hard as the dedicated single saber stance, but let you keep your distance while recharging your gun.The blaster has a nice give-and-take that's consistent with every stance, though most weaknesses can be overcome with upgrade points. The weapon trees are a healthy mix incremental updgrades and entirely new moves, like a flurry of stabs that rapidly recharges Cal's blaster. After maxing out the blaster tree and equipping a few complimentary perks, I managed to clear entire rooms without swinging a saber\u2014definitely the jedi equivalent of a cheesy magic build in Elden Ring, and I feel no shame.Jedi: Survivor's combat clicked way better with me than Fallen Order's. Stances are part of it, and having easily three times more types of enemies is nice, but honestly, I like that it's easier.

Stepping through doors sometimes triggers double-digit framerate drops for ten seconds or more. Cutscenes often plummet to 15-20 fps, cut off or overlap dialogue, and usually don't recover until I get control back.I'm no Unreal Engine expert, but the worst slowdowns always seem to occur when the game's loading stuff in the background. Using the galaxy map on Cal's ship turned into a slideshow every single time\u2014presumably because it's begun loading the planet I'm about to travel to. Performance in the most open parts of Koboh is pretty bad, too. On an RTX 2080 Super, i9-9900KS 4.00GHz, and 32GB RAM, I was lucky to squeeze a 35 fps average in the semi-open world. Isolated levels ran flawlessly at 80-90 fps, so there's clearly something up with the way Respawn is drawing big spaces. I briefly tried one other machine (RTX 3060, Ryzen 7 5700G, 16GB RAM) and had the same problems.Fiddling with graphics options didn't help much, either. There's no native option to limit the framerate, but the Nvidia control panel did the trick. The only upscaling option is FSR 2.0, which usually failed to improve my fps but always succeeded in making Cal's face blurry and unintelligible in motion. I've never missed DLSS more.For what it's worth, there's a pre-release patch coming a few days before launch, and among the patch notes EA shared with press is \"performance improvements across all platforms.\" Hopefully it'll help, but I'd be surprised if all of those framerate drops disappeared overnight. We are living in a time of bad PC ports, after all.Unacceptable performance aside, the good news is I still had a great time. Jedi: Survivor is a bigger, bolder game than its predecessor that prioritizes tight level design over map scale, a rarity in an age of sprawling sandboxes. This is Respawn firing on all cylinders, having finally figured out what works in its weird soulslike adventure format.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is an excellent sequel and a fun Star Wars story, but maybe wait for better performance.Morgan has been writing for PC Gamer since 2018, first as a freelancer and currently as a staff writer.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nEurogamer, Generic Kenobi!\r\nIt's easy to think of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in terms of its predecessor. Jedi: Fallen Order was broadly thought of as a good game with a few snags holding it back, namely a few disruptive technical issues, an incomprehensible map, and an overreliance on backtracking through lengthy platform sequences (not helped by, you know, the incomprehensible map). Fix those, you reckon, and there's probably a very good game here.\r\n\r\nMostly, Jedi: Survivor has fixed all that. Or at least patched it up. There's much less backtracking this time, thanks to new and plentiful fast travel points.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c31e0af-aa94-4eac-b65b-9d006e418103": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c31e0af-aa94-4eac-b65b-9d006e418103", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b3e3818-6315-4189-90fa-5f2a9334ad69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e446e9f6ec1ebae07103d789db47c152d760cfcdef9cafe0ae4eec20921a433d"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d9bccda-80a5-4399-8e73-1b31331ff91a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "83c5ca133fe831ee72d5db721c42a9dacf993dd549586a33ecd5873ec40da5ee"}}, "hash": "7d103e40f6e2233b56feb851591b43c6ff9db4430450de1654c38c10665e089e", "text": "There's much less backtracking this time, thanks to new and plentiful fast travel points. The map is clearer, since sacrificing the Star Wars-iness of the last game's flickering holo effects for this one's more opaque visual helps a fair bit. And the technical issues are less catastrophic, although things can still get pretty rough at the seams - think hands, hair, and various items regularly clipping through surfaces, and some frantic pop-in and cloak-flapping when coming in and out of cutscenes. Plus one hard crash - but broadly, those gripes have been tended to.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, Jedi: Survivor's systems have expanded beyond Fallen Order's. Instead of adding a few potted plants to Cal Kestis' ship, after you've collected their seeds from the wild, you now have an entire roof garden on the new planet, Koboh, that you can pootle about with. Instead of new people you meet during the story joining you on the ship as major characters, NPCs will now be recruited to Greeze's Koboh bar, Pyloon Saloon. There's a new mini-game, a kind of highly simplified auto-chess battler, where you can deploy units that you'd defeated in battle and scanned with your lovable droid, BD-1, to unlock them. \r\n\r\nIf I were feeling really miserable I'd call this stuff filler, but it isn't quite. These are things that were already in Fallen Order that have had their little corners expanded: we already collected seeds and scanned enemies and had a little hub, of sorts, on the Mantis. You can see how they came to be - it's a direct sequel, the team at Respawn has a lot of the foundations already in place, so now they have time to expand on the little things, so might as well. Again, that's a recipe for bloat, but more importantly Jedi: Survivor, you'll discover, is a game about finding small ways to make a life under the Empire's oppression, and these little homely touches play into that. I might work through the last few opponents of the minigame - I am a sucker for miniature tactics - and I really could not have less interest in fumbling about with arranging space plants on a grid, but there's something sweet about their presence, which strikes at what Fallen Order and more prominently, Jedi: Survivor really are.\r\n\r\nJedi: Survivor is an endearingly sentimental game. Cameron Monaghan, Cal Kestis' voice actor and likeness, felt like such a strange casting choice in Fallen Order, but as he's developed here you can see much more of the reasoning - and much more payoff for it. Kestis is really a pseudo-Anakin Skywalker, an orphaned late teen with a little too much emotion, but in Survivor he's developed into more of a stand-in for every Jedi. \r\n\r\nAt it's best, Jedi: Survivor uses Cal as an example: here's what every Jedi must wrestle with in an Empire-dominated world. Familiar themes return - loss, anger, obsession, power and powerlessness - and they do so in the familiarly broad strokes of Star Wars lore, but they're potent ones. And Monaghan has such curiously clean, boyish looks, and Cal is so earnestly written, I can't help but feel a little charmed. There's a sense of the long arm of Disney maybe creeping in here - naturally Star Wars has been more overtly \"brand safe\" since that takeover, despite the inclusion of casual, if bloodless limb-lopping to Jedi: Survivor's combat and, shock, actual romance - but in this particular case it suits. \r\n\r\nCombat and action, of course, is where Jedi: Survivor's had its biggest expansion. Cal's gone from two-and-a-half to a whopping five fighting styles this time - the single and double blades from the first game, plus a full fleshing-out of dual-wielding and the two new ones: a Kylo Ren-style crossguard greatsword, and a blaster-and-lightsaber combo mode.\r\n\r\nBeing honest, I cannot tell you how disappointing it is to watch Respawn contrive to add a gun to a game that doesn't need one, and that's backed up by the lacklustre way it's been added. You can mash Triangle to shoot, hold it to shoot a bigger blast, do a little shoot-and-parry thing or perform a special move reminiscent of a watered-down Auto Pistol from Titanfall.

At best it's representative of the smack-on-the-nose approach to the notion of Jedi as wandering cowboys - Koboh is a wild west inspired planet complete with treasure-seeking prospectors, southern drawls, rideable mounts and cheesy thumb-in-the-belt faceoffs outside saloons - which is clearly being done playfully, but still doesn't make the blaster necessary. We had this conversation in Revenge of the Sith - \"so uncivilised,\" and all that - and bearing in mind you can lob an actual laser sword at someone's head using space magic, even if you set aside the \"old ways\" of the Jedi, as Survivor often encourages Cal to do, the pew pew pews will always feel relentlessly naff.\r\n\r\nThis also plays into the other half of Jedi: Survivor's pitching of Cal as the every-Jedi. As Edwin put it so brilliantly already, at its best Star Wars uses the fighting styles of its Force-sensitives as character in action, or even character development as it happens. By giving Cal a full five styles, plus a widened range of Force moves, like confusing enemies into attacking one another, the occasional predetermined mind trick and a fairly rudimentary pick up, put back down attack, his character's been lost in the noise. \r\n\r\nYou can see the tradeoff in action here, and I'm genuinely sympathetic to Respawn's dilemma. Fundamentally the fun of these new Jedi entries is their nature as these kinds of supermarket games - the broad, play-as-you-like action-adventure games with RPG elements, that are eminently enjoyable and absolutely have their place, being accessible and filled with choice. But there's no specialisation here and so no conviction, and no real, special magic that comes with it.\r\n\r\nThis, more than the nitpicks about its map or the sense that you were whacking enemies with a fluorescent lighting tube rather than a laser sword before Respawn added dismemberment, is this Jedi series' real problem. These are third-person action-adventure games centred around sword combat, boss fights, stagger gauges and execution blows, with plenty of metroidvania platforming thrown in too. But they also released into a post-Sekiro, post-God of War world.\r\n\r\nAs much as those games might sell themselves on their difficulty or their polish, what they really ride on is two very distinct ideas of how to tackle melee combat, executed to absolute world-leading standards. To massively simplify things, at Sekiro's end you have a demand for absolute precision and intention in how you play, at the expense of animation flourishes or forgiving targeting, with the goal of making you feel flimsy but deadly, a tiny, lethal ninja. At God of War's end it's about power: massive effects, auto-targeting enemies, and entire systems tuned for maximum satisfaction. Jedi: Survivor, and Fallen Order before it, sit almost precisely between the two - again aiming to capture as broad a range as possible. Too broad.\r\n\r\nCompare it with those games for results: occasionally (or often, if you're better than me, which is likely) in Jedi you will land a perfect parry or dodge. In God of War the entire game around you slows, warps, and your shield returns the blow with some almighty elastic snap. In Sekiro a parry is a small chip on the enemy's stance gauge - the real health bar of Sekiro - one of a dozen rapid, immaculately-timed strikes you might have to land just right. In Jedi a parry feels\u2026 okay? Its red circle finisher moves don't always actually trigger a finisher - some standard enemies take several - and breaking a foe's stance just leads to a small window to land a few lightsaber whacks. (I should say: I learned all this from reading Jason De Heras' own excellent blog - the combat design director on Fallen Order and Survivor. I have no doubt Respawn knows this stuff and has thought about it in real depth.)\r\n\r\nThe long and the short of it is Jedi: Survivor's combat is neither here nor there, neither satisfaction by explosive power fantasy feedback nor by the fantasy of precise personal competency in the face of terrible odds. Combine it with the magpie approach to design too - the platforming, the gardening, the settlement building and the all-new shops to spend collectibles - and it's a disappointing picture. Especially when those collectibles, with the lightsaber colours and stances handed out to you by default, rather than as the most exciting discoveries you might make as reward for exploring, just don't pop in the same ways as Fallen Order.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d10e2696-a4ac-4096-95ee-d7ee5babb99d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d10e2696-a4ac-4096-95ee-d7ee5babb99d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d9bccda-80a5-4399-8e73-1b31331ff91a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "83c5ca133fe831ee72d5db721c42a9dacf993dd549586a33ecd5873ec40da5ee"}, "3": {"node_id": "86ca44fe-03de-4cd2-b1d1-0206403fac1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8492853c5ad3ab364981499c105aed95db95144fe0e7efa1f0708b8ce8a495fc"}}, "hash": "1ec0a0e72cf3a3902ebfb3687945ecc62560328f66aa6e0c32c87bc075141a6f", "text": "But - and a big but, I can't emphasise this enough - Star Wars: Jedi Survivor remains fundamentally really fun. Cal's platforming skills expand even more, and Jedi: Survivor's set pieces have become even more elaborate. There's a whiff of Force Unleashed at times, with the angsty but wonderfully over the top sense of action and melodrama. It is always enjoyable to ping yourself around runnable walls and ziplines and now grapple hooks (I know) like a human pinball. It is much more desirable that Star Wars games have a little goofiness, from genuinely funny companions like Greeze to the sheer amount of Jedi Suspension of Disbelief you have to harness throughout, than it is that they become too self-serious or stoic. UItimately this is the almost impossible tradeoff Respawn has with Star Wars: Jedi Survivor. Its lack of focus is what holds it back - and also what makes it such a blast.\r\n\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nChris Tapsell\n\n          Deputy Editor\n        Chris Tapsell is Eurogamer's Deputy Editor and most decorated Football Manager.

More ambitious, confident, and heartfelt, it's clear that this is Respawn Entertainment at full stretch, relishing in the scope and scale afforded by the success of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. All that holds this bold sequel back, on occasion, is Jedi: Survivor's tendency to over-reach in its attempt to tell the next Star Wars epic.\u00a0Release date: April 28, 2023\nPlatform(s): PS5, Xbox Series X, PC\nDeveloper: Respawn Entertainment\nPublisher: Electronic ArtsPicking up five years after the events of Jedi: Fallen Order, Cal Kestis is himself key to Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's expansion. While most sequels offer something of a character reset, the story of Fallen Order makes that impossible for Cal \u2013 his growth through that game a crucial part of what his character has become in this one. The result is a Jedi more confident and agile than before, a fighter who feels like he's reveling in his abilities from the very beginning. The Force Powers that Cal spent Jedi: Fallen Order recovering \u2013 double-jumps, wall-running, push and pull \u2013 are all there, ensuring versatility in combat from the outset. Combine that with a fighting style which flows between strikes more smoothly, and a camera that closes ever-so-slightly closer in on the action, and Cal feels like the hero of his story from its opening moments.But it's not just Cal that feels better from the start. The galaxy itself has been brought to life in a way more in line with the best Star Wars movies than anything Jedi: Fallen Order offers. An early scene feels like a shot directly out of the original trilogy. Set-pieces offer incredible vistas and heart-in-mouth action scenes. Planets feel like planets, rather than tiny regions. There are living worlds to explore, not just arenas of carefully-placed stormtroopers. Jedi: Survivor injects a huge amount of life into the Star Wars universe, and in doing so gives Respawn room to play. There's humor and heart far beyond what I was expecting, and it's only given the space to come to the surface because of the work that's gone into making the galaxy feel like a living, breathing entity.Much of that work is attached to Koboh, a planet that functions as a hub world for Cal to explore, as well as the location for a significant portion of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's story. Styled after the American Old West, it's a classic frontier town; prospectors on every corner, a ranch owned by a woman literally called Mosey, an old-timey bartender droid in the saloon, and a bounty hunter-hunter obscured beneath the brim of a stetson.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4290f4d0-7715-4f2f-95ed-dc1fb163b4e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "4290f4d0-7715-4f2f-95ed-dc1fb163b4e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "86ca44fe-03de-4cd2-b1d1-0206403fac1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8492853c5ad3ab364981499c105aed95db95144fe0e7efa1f0708b8ce8a495fc"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ac2b71c-246b-43d4-9e6a-25fdac6dd971", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "30cc3cb93e1f79fb46fc20c1613ec4d2d469df553029265182a7b61f2571776e"}}, "hash": "3e0c335a686ed417255205a3acd855873c86e53a156d2825b98c4ac6be2cb31c", "text": "Koboh is huge, a space that feels as though it dwarfs all of Jedi: Fallen Order combined and has the density to match its square footage; Jedi: Survivor's Metroidvania-style traversal is at its most varied in the towering mesas and weaving canyons that spin off from the main hub area. Side-content, optional bosses, and puzzles fill every nook and cranny, and patrolling troopers ensure you're not just battling random fauna as you explore. Fast-travel ensures that Koboh's biggest expanses aren't too disruptive, but it's clear that Survivor's maps haven't been deliberately built to take advantage of the system.All that size, however, remains the foundation of Jedi: Survivor's keenest weakness. There are times when, in an attempt to fill this vast space, Respawn isn't sure what to do beyond throwing challenges at you. Sometimes, these are elaborate jumping puzzles, other times arenas full to bursting with enemies. Through the first act in particular, there were times where I was desperately searching for a place to stop, more so that I could take a break than so Cal could replenish his health.In an attempt to match the scope of its story to the size of its world, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor stumbles. What I thought was set to be a climactic moment after a beautiful set-piece ended up being only the end of the game's first act. The story streamlines as you progress beyond this point, but having spent a dozen or more hours building up a major threat, Jedi: Survivor finds it difficult to climb back down. Later stages are suitable fodder for the broader stakes of the story, but it's clear that Jedi: Survivor is trying hard to land on a true antagonist.The main cast, however, is more than capable of supporting Jedi: Survivor through its less certain steps. As the Empire closes its fist around the galaxy, there's a fascinating dichotomy at play between those desperately trying to find a place to hide from the regime's greatest cruelties and those still trying to fight against it. Jedi: Survivor explores the time before the Rebel Alliance is established \u2013 a period where hope has given way to anger, fear, and resentment.\u00a0 Jedi: Survivor sets itself up as a benchmark for what new Star Wars stories can look likeAs Cal and Jedi Master Cere harden in the face of the injustices they fight against, other characters soften as they search for a safe haven in which to wait out the storm. The performance by Merrin actor Tina Ivlev is a particular highlight in a story that constantly plays to the strengths of its ensemble cast. Belly laughs are woven in alongside tragedy, but the mundanity of daily life is a potent refrain. As this universe moves away from The Skywalker saga, Jedi: Survivor sets itself up as a benchmark for what new Star Wars stories can look like.Jedi: Survivor so clearly wants to live up to that mantle. There's a sense of Cal as a folk hero, and of this story as a chance to show off what the galaxy looks like for those that aren't its destined heroes. The focus is on the people simply trying to scratch out a living in the face of constant oppression, whether they once wielded a lightsaber or not. It doesn't always work out \u2013 Koboh's many side-quests don't aren't really necessary to prove Cal's desire to help people \u2013 but there's a maturity here that embraces Star Wars' space-western roots while making clear that there's a very big galaxy to explore out there.As strong as the world and characters around him are, it's still Cal who's forced to knit the whole thing together, and he really shines as he does so. With a suite of Force powers immediately available, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor gives you the space to play. The sandbox-style moments that once marked little more than the chance to try out a new skill in Jedi: Fallen Order now feel like a regular occurrence; arenas filled with droids or troopers are scattered liberally, offering the chance to really get to grips with the many new abilities you've got. Jedi mind tricks let you turn enemies into allies, Force Pull lets you turn a trooper's weapon on his friends, whole groups of foes can be flung around like ragdolls.But the real star is Cal's new and improved saber. From the single and dual-blade setup he starts with, Cal gains three new stances; twin blades are fast and frantic, harrying foes under a persistent rain of blows until their guard breaks; the blaster stance lets Cal engage from range, recouping ammo with probing, testing strikes; and the crossguard turns saber into Zweihander, a slow but devastating weapon to smash through even the most hardy defenses.\u00a0The Empire remains present, but takes a back seat as Jedi: Survivor tells a different kind of story.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ac2b71c-246b-43d4-9e6a-25fdac6dd971": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ac2b71c-246b-43d4-9e6a-25fdac6dd971", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "4290f4d0-7715-4f2f-95ed-dc1fb163b4e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3e0c335a686ed417255205a3acd855873c86e53a156d2825b98c4ac6be2cb31c"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd708f8d-ceef-4dba-b0a7-7416f6879998", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e685dc4be06f262d5b336750eeed497205f1622014fb29ec0b14bb70c53c126"}}, "hash": "30cc3cb93e1f79fb46fc20c1613ec4d2d469df553029265182a7b61f2571776e", "text": "Instead, your main foe is an army of raiders and their repurposed battle droids. Initially presented for comic relief, they soon become reminiscent of Borderlands' Claptrap with their constant barks, perhaps it's best they've been largely abandoned to the prequel trilogy.As I started to get to grips with multiple stances, combat really opened up. The balance system, defined by Cal's parrying skills, continues to make Jedi: Survivor's fights feel like delicate duels, without robbing you of the chance to let loose around weaker enemies. Combined with those improved Force abilities, combat started to feel like a sandbox of control, dancing back and forth between cowering groups of enemies, sending a batch of stormtroopers flying off a ledge while ducking around a security droid as a Flame Trooper turns on his allies. Occasionally, Jedi: Survivor's ambition would catch up to it again, cramming multiple complex enemies into the same space Fallen Order might have put a single miniboss, but despite some slightly cheap tactics, especially around battle droids, the difficulty balance felt perfect, especially in bigger spaces. At the end of one arena, out of stims and with just a sliver of health left, I felled a final enemy and breathed a genuine sigh of relief.It took a while, but by the end of Jedi: Survivor the different stances really came into their own. Dual Blades felt crucial throughout, given the weight of enemies in some areas, and that means it's a shame that only two stances can be active at any one time. To alternate between them Cal has to meditate, making it difficult to work out how best to use each one. An early boss succumbed to the constant pressure of the Twin Blades whittling down its weak defenses, but later on that same stance felt weightless in the face of the fury of stronger enemies. I turned to the Crossguard, a heavier weapon to let me weather the storm of those withering blows before retaliating in kind. Coupled with Perks, which let you further dial in on the strengths or weaknesses of particular stances, and there's depth to Jedi: Survivor that definitely wasn't present in the first game.Even traversal is transformed \u2013 the confidence that's evident in Cal's combat feels like it lets him jump higher and wall run further right from the start, and mid-way through the game you're slingshotting around, chaining together gravity-defying flights above aching drops like something out of a Spider-Man movie. Jedi: Survivor puts something of a limit on your leaps with a form of fall damage, but there's a sense of mastery around movement that's quietly one of its most exciting additions.All of Cal's new powers are additive \u2013 nothing is lost from Jedi: Fallen Order, and what you gain feels like a seamless extension of character and universe. It's obvious that there'd be plenty of connective tissue between games, but Respawn uses Cal's first adventure as an excellent foundation for his second; the re-use of Imperial enemies and animations helps stitch these stories together so closely that there were moments that the entire experience was so cohesive I could've believed it was DLC.It's the confidence to unabashedly lean on what's come before that lets Star Wars Jedi: Survivor become its own excellent version of something new. Respawn pushes slowly at the edges of Fallen Order to expand its take on this world, doing so with an obvious love and respect not only for its source material, but its characters. Where it over-reaches, it does so out of an ambition so apparent that it leaps off the screen, but always manages to ground itself in a beautifully human story. In allowing Cal Kestis' story to grow with him, Jedi: Survivor establishes what could be the next great Star Wars hero, and is certainly one of the best Star Wars games out there.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was reviewed on PS5, with a code provided by the publisher.I'm GamesRadar's news editor, working with the team to deliver breaking news from across the industry.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, The sequel to Fallen Order continues its unexpected mix of Dark Souls and Uncharted, as the Star Wars Jedi saga continues\u2026It\u2019s a terrible curse to be a Star Wars fan, to endure the roller-coaster of quality that goes from the nadir of The Rise Of Skywalker and The Mandalorian season 3 to the unexpected joys of The Mandalorian\u2019s earlier seasons and the amazing Andor. By comparison, the video games have achieved nothing like the same highs and lows since Disney took over, they\u2019ve just all been pretty good without ever being particularly exciting.Star Wars Squadrons is probably EA\u2019s best effort so far, but the Battlefront games were both fun, if unimaginative, diversions. 2019\u2019s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was more ambitious, although even now the idea of mixing Dark Souls gameplay with Star Wars seems an odd combination. Fallen Order was never as difficult as that comparison implies but that was clearly the primary inspiration, along with Uncharted and Super Metroid.The end result was a solid and enjoyable experience but one that suffered from some irritating level design contrivances, bland storytelling, and Force powers that were never quite as fun as other games with telekinesis (especially Control, which came out only a few months earlier). It was good but it could have been better, and that is exactly what Survivor sets out to be.To be honest, the storytelling is still one of the weaker elements, with Survivor taking a peculiarly long time to set up any kind of clear goal or threat. You play as Cal Kestis, de facto Jedi Knight and charisma vacuum, who starts the game ineffectually trying to fight the Empire and then stumbles into a needlessly complex plot involving the High Republic era and an unreachable planet that may or may not be a safe haven for dissenters.Although it\u2019s a dozen hours before you have any real clue as to what\u2019s going on, the plot isn\u2019t quite as overegged as Fallen Order and, importantly, the character work is generally better. Cal and a lot of the leads have Aloy from Horizon syndrome, in that they\u2019re deadly earnest and dull as dishwater, but many of the side ones are quite fun, including indestructible bounty hunter Rayvis and a number of comic relief aliens and droids. The repurposed battle droids are particularly funny, with their hapless comments ranging from absurdly unjustified confidence to fatalistic despair.There\u2019s little real depth to the characterisation or storytelling though and while there\u2019s a faint attempt to mimic the more forthright portrayal of the Empire seen in Andor and The Bad Batch it amounts to little of substance. Although the game does better as it tackles the question of morality within the Jedi order, as Cal flirts with the dark side.The core gameplay of Survivor is very similar to Fallen Order, so much so that you start the game with all the abilities Cal learnt by the end of the last game \u2013 rather than you starting from scratch in traditional Metroid style. That\u2019s not the problem for accessibility it might sound, as the basics of combat are very simple: a single main button for swinging your lightsaber and pushing and pulling with the Force is on the left and right triggers.There\u2019s also a dodge, a parry, a bullet time meter that builds up, and dozens of special lightsaber moves for each of five stances, but these are either easily ignored at first or introduced later, once you have the hang of things.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4145c448-83c0-44a2-af4f-b00b9c1aa316": {"__data__": {"id_": "4145c448-83c0-44a2-af4f-b00b9c1aa316", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd708f8d-ceef-4dba-b0a7-7416f6879998", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e685dc4be06f262d5b336750eeed497205f1622014fb29ec0b14bb70c53c126"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3084e4c-4747-4ba5-a6ae-4c2f83d03e00", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2095785fb0d4ef5576fb59533144fef2c6e600b7dd3006fbb62898daaf93e6ff"}}, "hash": "25a7ea4f2a74b43705051c49a3bfe494925e9baa1150fd3052de899d65d33d86", "text": "The parry, which lets you get in a free hit if you do it at just the right moment, is certainly optional as you can automatically block most attacks anyway, only having to dodge out of the way when an enemy flashes red.Lightsaber combat is difficult to get right in any game because theoretically it should cut through anything and there are very few talented opponents in the galaxy, especially in this pre-A New Hope period. Survivor balances its compromises very well though, with a lot of enemies having staffs that can stand up to lightsabers, similar to the ones used by General Grievous\u2019 guards in Revenge of the Sith.There\u2019s also a lot of heavily armoured droids and fauna, including everything from rancors to different variants of wampa. The idea is that you switch between one of two stances at any time, depending on whether you need to rely on quick attacks, working with a crowd, fighting another lightsaber user, or even using a blaster. You can switch your chosen two stances when you rest at the game\u2019s equivalent of Dark Souls bonfires, where you can also unlock skill trees and assign perks.The use of lightsabers is an improvement on Fallen Order and a new high watermark for laser swords in video games, with a really solid, satisfying heft to the action. As good as it is though, the Force powers still aren\u2019t as much fun as Control, probably because Star Wars in general tends to use telekinesis in a less bombastic manner.Survivor, like Fallen Order, is patchwork of ideas from other games, where the joins are very obvious. Much of the platforming is straight out of Uncharted, while it also includes a Metroid style grappling hook and Assassin\u2019s Creed wall jumps. The puzzle-solving isn\u2019t exactly The Legend Of Zelda but it is more involved than the action game norm, with the added bonus that you can tell the game to shut up and stop giving you hints every five seconds.Everything in Survivor is that little bit better than you\u2019d expect, to the point where you begin to forget that it doesn\u2019t really have a single original idea of its own. However, we\u2019re still not convinced that Star Wars x Dark Souls is a very sensible idea. The level design of a Soulslike, with its interconnected levels and secret shortcuts, is actually quite abstract and nonsensical if you analyse it, but it makes sense in context because of the games\u2019 surreal, fantasy setting.By being that little bit more grounded it all starts to seem rather contrived in a Star Wars setting, especially in a fictional world where anti-gravity devices and jetpacks are commonplace. Your new pal Bode has one of the latter and the game would probably be over in half the time if you just played as him. As it is you get him, and nightsister Merrin (basically a witch), helping you out in some of the levels, where you can direct them to attack specific enemies.As well as brand new features, the game also sets about addressing all the complaints levelled at the original, with not just fast travel but also several different mounts you can use on different planets, some just for speed and others because of climbing abilities or other benefits. Together with the generally more coherent level design this makes backtracking far less of a chore than in Fallen Order.What\u2019s also new is the game\u2019s more open world environments. There are several planets in the game but two of them in particular are quite large and non-linear. They\u2019re not terribly imaginative in terms of biomes \u2013 a rock planet with a bit of jungle and a rock planet with a bit of desert \u2013 but there\u2019s tons to see and do, including side quests, a near endless array of collectibles, and trial challenges that work something like Zelda: Breath Of The Wild shrines.It\u2019s going to take the average person something like 30 hours to complete the whole game and far more to see everything, which is very impressive given the size of the world(s) and the quality of the visuals.There are some blind spots when it comes to the graphics, though, which while generally impressive aren\u2019t very good at faces and come with some disappointing frame rate problems at certain points \u2013 as well as the inevitable promises of a day one patch. Some of the animation is a bit jagged too, with some odd choices, such as an overuse of the flip Luke does while training on Dagobah, that never stops looking silly.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationOverall though this is a small but measurable improvement on the original.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3084e4c-4747-4ba5-a6ae-4c2f83d03e00": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3084e4c-4747-4ba5-a6ae-4c2f83d03e00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "4145c448-83c0-44a2-af4f-b00b9c1aa316", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "25a7ea4f2a74b43705051c49a3bfe494925e9baa1150fd3052de899d65d33d86"}, "3": {"node_id": "8daf6718-4f2e-4a4f-bec1-ddffd827c204", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4590c3eff19ae51e5d03f126426be24a22e90350cbdc5509befffb6608813329"}}, "hash": "2095785fb0d4ef5576fb59533144fef2c6e600b7dd3006fbb62898daaf93e6ff", "text": "It\u2019s far too beholden to its many inspirations to be considered a classic but is in itself a very solid and well-made game.

Lots of skills and collectibles to discover and some well-designed levels and open world areas. The battle droids are great.Cons: Almost no original ideas of its own.

Picking up where its predecessor left off, Jedi: Survivor isn\u2019t just more of the same but more of virtually everything, with meaningful advances and improvements across the board. It\u2019s a longer game with greater levels of customization, more enemies, more diverse approaches to combat and puzzles, and more storytelling and character development for its compelling cast of characters. While some structural and story choices start to wear thin, Jedi: Survivor is nonetheless a step up in almost all the ways that matter. It also manages to capture a lot of the tonal and thematic ideas that work about this fiction, helping cement its place as one of the best in the long history of Star Wars games.As we rejoin Cal Kestis, there\u2019s little of the step back in power that some action game sequels attempt. He's a full-fledged Jedi Knight, with all the Force powers and lightsaber tricks you worked so hard to earn last time still in place. Robust onboarding quickly gets into the action and story, making you feel powerful and capable. The flexibility of playstyle expands from there, with new saber stances and equipment that provide choice in confronting the galaxy\u2019s dangers. The downside is that most upgrades to Cal\u2019s use of the Force feel more like twists and tweaks rather than wholly new powers, but it\u2019s a small price to pay for well-paced action from beginning to end.Combat and dueling are excellent, demanding a Jedi\u2019s patience for defense to master. It\u2019s impressive to balance battle encounters across a big game like this so that they remain challenging at every step, but Cal\u2019s new adventure manages to do so. A wide variety of formidable foes await, each demanding observation and canny button work. A few late-game bosses rely on frustrating cheap tricks, but they always make for climactic and affecting encounters.I adore the mobility and navigation challenges, which nail that sense of controlling a Force-attuned hero leaping and swinging through seemingly impossible paths. Like the combat, a satisfying upward slope of complexity keeps traversal engaging throughout \u2013 no small feat in a game this big.

I felt invested in the adventure and the improvements I found along the way.Across its lengthy campaign, Jedi: Survivor takes an initially meandering course to find its plotline but eventually coalesces into a story about disparate people searching for a safe home. The moment-to-moment character interactions and dialogue help elevate the lack of focus, with some sweeping melodrama in the best traditions of Star Wars fiction. The distinctions between love and attachment, and the dangers of both, often lurk in the background of Star Wars stories. Those themes take centerstage this time, with memorable and rewarding results.Developer Respawn Entertainment clearly took a measured and thoughtful approach to analyze what worked and what didn\u2019t in its last Star Wars game, and Jedi: Survivor feels like a worthy attempt at evolution. It captures the magic of Star Wars as well as anything in the current canon, and it\u2019s a stellar adventure in its own right. Still, nailing the fantasy of being a Jedi?

Exhilarating lightsaber combat and physics-defying platforming puzzle challenges remain the best part of Respawn's latest Star Wars game, but Survivor also makes big swings with its story this time around. Cal's quest takes him to new corners of the galaxy, but the most compelling journey he makes is an introspective one. Survivor is a very well-written tale about overcoming fear, and it's the Jedi story I've wanted for a long time.Survivor takes place about five years after the events of Fallen Order, with the Mantis crew having gone their separate ways to pursue different goals in a galaxy increasingly dominated by the Galactic Empire. After a daring escape from Imperial authorities, protagonist Cal finds himself on the planet Koboh, where he discovers a High Republic Jedi protocol droid who carries a clue to reaching Tanalorr, a supposedly unreachable mythical planet. Seeing a potential home that's free of the Empire's influence, Cal sets about reassembling the Mantis crew for another galactic scavenger hunt, but his efforts are waylaid by a former High Republic Jedi who--having originally discovered Tanalorr decades prior and bid his time until the right moment--wants Tanalorr for his own purposes.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Star Wars Jedi: Survivor Review - Fear ItselfThe High Republic is a fascinating time period for Survivor to connect its story to given what we know has transpired between that era and the events of post-Revenge of the Sith. The comics describe The High Republic as the golden age of the Jedi. And that may be the case, but we also know this time period will culminate in the Jedi Order led by Master Yoda, who preached to a young Anakin Skywalker that \"fear is the path to the Dark Side.\" Not anger. Not grief. Not any of the other emotions a Jedi is supposed to unhealthily suppress.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed56f29a-8636-45c7-bcd0-5e0cbb8ad9aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "ed56f29a-8636-45c7-bcd0-5e0cbb8ad9aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "8daf6718-4f2e-4a4f-bec1-ddffd827c204", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4590c3eff19ae51e5d03f126426be24a22e90350cbdc5509befffb6608813329"}, "3": {"node_id": "0efde38f-f1f0-490d-930d-02da9826cebb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "05380ba3e3be7f88c40ee746d83515c2aa11f0cee36c1b1dbfa9d2bde15aa464"}}, "hash": "e6c085eb9ebffa2fff9d65c478a61a83504a36a083ccedd9483de2dc3e62d5c8", "text": "Not any of the other emotions a Jedi is supposed to unhealthily suppress. The events of the High Republic teach the Jedi that fear is the path to evil--the other emotions are just stepping stones along it.Survivor runs with that idea, exploring the concept of fear and what it means for someone like Cal, a survivor of both a war and a genocidal attack on his people, to live with the ever-present shadow of fear. As a survivor of the Jedi Order, Cal fears failing to live up to its ideals, compelling him to go to unhealthy extremes in his fight against the Empire. All the while, he pushes down the growing sentiment he feels for those he loves in order to avoid painful rejection.While the theme of fear and how it can change you is central to Cal's journey, Survivor's main antagonists also benefit from this focus, transforming into foils for Cal to reflect on his actions. On their own, the two big bads lack the level of nuanced characterization I want from a villain--in the end, both boil down to being evil because they're selfish, albeit in different ways. It's not exactly compelling when compared to Fallen Order's terrifying and yet understandably tragic Second Sister. But as foils for Cal, Survivor's villains catalyze his growth. First, forcing him to come to terms with how his reckless pursuit of destroying the Empire and reaching Tanalorr could culminate in his own fall to the Dark Side if he's not careful. And second, recognizing the importance of being a new type of Jedi for a changed galaxy.We've seen variations of these transformations in Jedi before--Luke Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano being the two major examples in the current canon. But in Cal's journey, Respawn delves even deeper into what it means for a Jedi grappling with the doubts and insecurities that everyday people in the Star Wars universe navigate all the time. Cal did not grow up as a normal kid like Luke nor did he have a non-traditional mentor as a padawan like Ahsoka. As a result, his attempts to wrestle with his fears of obsession and commitment are more tenuous and susceptible to outside influence than the Jedi we've seen safely balance their internal light and darkness before.As a result, Cal's conflict with Survivor's villains sees him regularly teetering toward the Dark Side more than the typical Star Wars protagonist (save for Anakin Skywalker, obviously), leaving you guessing up until the final fight of the game as to where Cal's moral compass is eventually going to align. That seesaw ride is so poignant because Survivor's story gives Cal a lot to care about and isn't afraid to see him lose it during crucial narrative beats. The narrative incentive of Survivor isn't a desire to see the good guys win, it's to explore just how much the good guys are willing to throw away on their path to victory.While these new personal challenges require a great deal of growth from Cal to grapple with, the more immediate physical challenges rely on a familiar set of skills and abilities. Survivor smartly avoids the pitfall of depowering its protagonist, meaning Cal starts off with the lightsaber and traversal abilities he earned during Fallen Order. Against the weaker foes of the early game, Cal already feels suitably dominant, as a seasoned Jedi that has been fighting for survival should be. You are empowered to slice through simple Storm Troopers and perform Force-propelled parkour across bottomless pits with ease. These skills don't mean Cal is all-powerful, though, and after an exciting opening chapter, Survivor puts you in your place with an assortment of challenging new enemy types. This encourages you to spend your points wisely in Survivor's branching skill tree to unlock new powers.Much like Fallen Order, Survivor's combat primarily relies on Cal's lightsaber, slicing through an enemy's guard and parrying their strikes until their stamina gives out so you can land some solid hits. It's much easier to discern incoming attacks from fakeouts or preemptive wind-ups in Survivor compared to Fallen Order, and Cal's moves feel sharper and quicker this time around, too. This affords you more control in the heat of battle and helps the game's mostly fast-paced fights feel more surmountable. When an enemy gets a hit in, it now feels more like your mistake and not a stroke of bad luck where the glow of Cal's lightsaber and particle effects of an enemy's weapon muddied the visual language of the parry mechanic.Cal has his own stamina meter to worry about, so combat is as much about control and careful timing as it is about being strategically aggressive. Each battle plays out as a cerebral exercise; the experience evolves with an exciting flow as you get the hang of it, all of which is captured with incredible audio detail.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0efde38f-f1f0-490d-930d-02da9826cebb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0efde38f-f1f0-490d-930d-02da9826cebb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed56f29a-8636-45c7-bcd0-5e0cbb8ad9aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6c085eb9ebffa2fff9d65c478a61a83504a36a083ccedd9483de2dc3e62d5c8"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ea72fdd-e3c0-4c8f-add1-75a830fbb406", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67e180d5e08934eb04401557b4e2620d437e191521d1323290c05cded95e93b3"}}, "hash": "05380ba3e3be7f88c40ee746d83515c2aa11f0cee36c1b1dbfa9d2bde15aa464", "text": "Each carefully deflected blaster bolt resounds with that distinctive Star Wars ping; the hum of Cal's lightsaber and the compressed flux of Force energy help sell the exhilarating thrill of playing as a Jedi Knight.Though BD-1 is still your regular companion who keeps you healed up and unlocks doors, Cal is joined by other characters during certain parts of the story too. Either the blaster-toting Bode or magick-wielding Merrin joins Cal in certain story missions to help him deal with tougher fights. Neither one adds anything especially noteworthy to the experience of combat but they are a welcome resource for crowd control in the tough-as-nails fights in the latter half of the game, and their tag-team takedowns with Cal are all visual delights.To go along with the idea that he's now older and more skilled, Cal also gets two new lightsaber stances in Survivor: Blaster and Crossguard. The former offers Cal a ranged fighting style while the latter deals in slow but heavy strikes. Both have their advantages, but Blaster feels a lot better in motion, matching the other three styles in sense of speed. Cal feels strongest when he's weaving through a crowd of enemies, deflecting blaster bolts and quickly striking his opponent in the moments their guard falters, and that's just trickier to do with the slower Crossguard style.Survivor limits you to only having two lightsaber stances equipped at a time, forcing you to visit a meditation circle checkpoint in order to change them. At times, this restriction can feel frustrating as it funnels how you spend your skill points into the two styles you ultimately end up using most often, thereby discouraging experimentation. And since you only get one free skill respec per playthrough there's little opportunity to explore what could be interesting new abilities and approaches. You can respec after using the freebie, but you have to give up one of your skill points each time.While I initially found this stifling, I came to appreciate how the limitation forced me to adapt to where I did allocate my skill points, especially when it came to lightsaber stances. Each style has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, so you can curate your own take on how Cal fights. You decide where Cal falls short--crowd control, for example, or maybe all-out attack power--and then get creative in how you overcome that weakness. I opted to focus on the jack-of-all-trades Single stance and range-focused Blaster stance, for instance, which made Cal a beast at dueling one-on-one. However, I suffered during combat encounters where the game threw a dozen enemies at a time at me. In those instances, I leaned on Force abilities to help Cal stall certain foes long enough so that I wouldn't be overwhelmed. It felt like I was able to make my own unique version of Cal who specialized in this fun hit-and-run fighting style that ultimately carried me through to the credits.Platforming challenges and Force puzzles return in Survivor as well. Like combat, both feel better in Survivor in comparison to Fallen Order--Cal automatically latches onto climbable surfaces now, and a healthy assortment of unlockable shortcuts means that accidentally missing a jump midway through an action set piece likely won't set you back too far. Survivor has a helpful hint system, too. More importantly, it respects your intelligence, only popping up if you leave the game idling while you're in the midst of a puzzle or you seem stuck. And even then, like Fallen Order, the game will ask if you'd like a hint first instead of just giving you a clue outright--that's a welcome level of restraint. It only offered to give me hints twice, both times during puzzles I just really couldn't figure out where to go or what to do. I don't know how Survivor knew which puzzles I wanted to take the time to figure out and which I desperately needed a clue for, but it did.Survivor is at its best when every element--story, combat, and puzzle platforming--collides together with frenetic momentum in a way that is quintessentially Star Wars. This is most apparent in one of the game's most memorable highlights, a boss fight about midway through the game. The moment features segments of combat, platforming, and a major narrative payoff, in which Cal and Merrin work together to destroy an Imperial mining tool, combining Jedi abilities and Nightsister magick in a tense, cinematic encounter where your reactions are put to the test and Survivor's absolute banger of a soundtrack is swelling in your ears. It all culminates in the two allies taking down the machine with one of the coolest finishing moves I've seen in any Star Wars project.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9ea72fdd-e3c0-4c8f-add1-75a830fbb406": {"__data__": {"id_": "9ea72fdd-e3c0-4c8f-add1-75a830fbb406", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "0efde38f-f1f0-490d-930d-02da9826cebb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "05380ba3e3be7f88c40ee746d83515c2aa11f0cee36c1b1dbfa9d2bde15aa464"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6c7b483-ece2-4feb-a4e0-7ccf1615b01a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c68824fcd96beaa4bb9972bca52efdafd774ac2f20ebe3075e1b4d4f5cf35052"}}, "hash": "67e180d5e08934eb04401557b4e2620d437e191521d1323290c05cded95e93b3", "text": "I actually stood up from my couch and cheered when it happened--you can tell that the team behind this game understands just how cool Star Wars can be.The game makes time for quiet moments too, best seen in another of Survivor's major new features: a hub-like area that Cal can return to frequently. On Koboh, Cal can visit a cantina that fills with NPCs you've saved on your travels across the galaxy. Some of these characters act as vendors, selling Cal cosmetics or optional gameplay perks. Others help Cal liven up the cantina with music or a rooftop garden. The best of them act as quest-givers, pointing Cal towards the puzzle boxes that are High Republic vaults, bounty hunter mini-bosses, or more recruitable NPCs. Even if the characters themselves are, for the most part, narratively flat and boring to talk to, the perks they sell are rewarding and the missions they give you are often fun to complete. Caij Vanda is my favorite--she helps you find the Haxion Brood bounty hunters who are coming for Cal after he escaped their clutches in Fallen Order. These bounty hunters are oftentimes nimble fighters with jetpacks, blasters, deployable shields, and a wide array of gadgets ideally suited for overwhelming a Force user. Tracking them down makes for some fantastically tense duels, and the rewards Caij gives Cal for doing so are some of the best in the game.On a final note, Survivor's technical performance is a stumbling block that must be noted. Playing on Xbox Series X, I experienced random crashes on a number of occasions, all annoyingly during cutscenes before the game had a chance to autosave. On one unlucky (and deeply frustrating) occasion, the game crashed during the cutscene following an especially challenging multiple-phase boss fight that had taken me many attempts to finally beat. Because of the crash, my progress was lost and I had to fight the boss half a dozen times again, earning a victory that felt so much more hollow than the first time I beat him. On PlayStation 5, a colleague reported some occasional stuttering, screen-tearing, and crashing too, and the PC version also has a variety of technical issues relating to in-game presentation, performance, and hardware optimization.Survivor builds on Fallen Order in several meaningful ways, tightening up the combat mechanics, expanding the variety of lightsaber styles, alleviating the frustration of platforming and puzzles, and digging into less-mainstream Star Wars lore to tell a fantastic story about a Jedi trying to defeat a tyrannical evil at all costs and coming to the realization that you can't just fight for good--you have to fight for good in the right way. It's a superb Star Wars game that gets into the nitty-gritty of the struggle of what it takes for a Jedi Knight to begin the journey toward the rank of Master.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:Build a team of space rogues in Respawn\u2019s much-improved, but still flawed, sequelYes, there is fast travel now.OK. Now that I\u2019ve gotten the most important part of the review out of the way, let\u2019s get properly started.Writing a video game review is a bit like having a whirlwind vacation romance: It all happens so fast, and you absolutely cannot gauge the experience by traditional metrics. You and your new obsession cram an entire relationship into a really compressed time frame, and as a result, emotions can run a bit hotter than you\u2019d anticipate.

Sometimes I\u2019d let out a piercing \u201cWOO!\u201d as I turned a grappling-hook vault into an air dash that literally took me through a Stormtrooper. Sometimes I\u2019d look at a room of 10 enemies I was expected to fight all at once while being pelted with blaster fire; say out loud, \u201cNah, bro\u201d; and walk away for a while. There were story beats I genuinely didn\u2019t see coming, and story beats so predictable that I groaned when they happened.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a bought-on-sale game collecting proverbial dust in my PlayStation library, but in preparation for this review, I threw an entire weekend at it before I even touched Jedi: Survivor.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6c7b483-ece2-4feb-a4e0-7ccf1615b01a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6c7b483-ece2-4feb-a4e0-7ccf1615b01a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ea72fdd-e3c0-4c8f-add1-75a830fbb406", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "67e180d5e08934eb04401557b4e2620d437e191521d1323290c05cded95e93b3"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea07e7de-56d0-4736-9f97-a9aacdb26893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9236369f9241b0633fec4b19db6bb0e4c48ddcd668b287019b9f2a0a8f195411"}}, "hash": "c68824fcd96beaa4bb9972bca52efdafd774ac2f20ebe3075e1b4d4f5cf35052", "text": "To my surprise, I encountered many enjoyable characters, fun but rote story beats, reasonably engaging puzzle rooms, plenty of Uncharted-esque climbing, but also a parade of serious roadblocks.

Provided we set some ground rules first.Jedi: Survivor is a more polished, thoughtful, and complete game than Jedi: Fallen Order. Protagonist Cal Kestis already has all the Jedi abilities he collected by the end of the first game, so you actually feel like a Jedi from the outset. Different lightsaber styles, which were introduced very late in Jedi: Fallen Order, don\u2019t always make a huge difference, but they do let you more effectively tailor your approach to the enemy mobs you\u2019re going to fight. There\u2019s fast travel now (seriously, Respawn, what were you thinking?), and the critical path in the sequel yields more survivability tools (health upgrades and healing stim charges) than Jedi: Fallen Order, where these helpful upgrades often required tedious backtracking \u2014 which was made all the worse by the lack of fast travel. (If you hadn\u2019t noticed, the fast travel thing really bothered me.)All the things I liked about Jedi: Fallen Order have returned, too. I\u2019m a sucker for a Jedi story, and Cal is, at the very least, a likable protagonist who doesn\u2019t make any egregious mistakes that test my patience. The cast of NPCs that you gradually assemble \u2014 a process that also involves getting the Jedi: Fallen Order band back together \u2014 ranges from will-they-won\u2019t-they love interests to a Scots-accented fisherman alien approximately 2 feet in height, each with their own amusing interactions and budding friendships (or more) with Cal. There\u2019s an enjoyable Mass Effect 2 vibe to (re)assembling your team as you race to collect the MacGuffins in order to save the galaxy.Jedi: Survivor\u2019s plot itself is not going to wow you with unexpected twists and turns, with perhaps one exception that was not only genuinely surprising, but sent the story to a place I never expected it to go. Of course, a story doesn\u2019t have to be surprising to be enjoyable, and truthfully, Jedi: Survivor\u2019s core narrative is mostly a vehicle to bring you to new locales and get to the real focus: Cal\u2019s developing relationships with the other major cast members, particularly returning character Merrin and new buddy Bode Akuna.While the total number of planets you visit in Jedi: Survivor isn\u2019t very high (six, a couple of which are pretty small), it\u2019s a visually pleasing game, and Jedi parkour-ing your way through jungles and floating sky ruins while using your Force powers and gadgets to get around is usually a good time. Most of the game takes place on the planet Koboh, a \u201cNew Mexico in space\u201d that\u2019s typical for Star Wars. You can freely explore Koboh, which also includes Breath of the Wild-esque puzzle dungeons that unlock new passive skills \u2014 a nice change from Jedi: Fallen Order\u2019s hidden treasures being largely cosmetic. (Then again, one of the first things I found in a treasure chest on Koboh was a mullet. Just saying.)It\u2019s not all peaches and, uh... blue milk, however. The combat is improved compared to Jedi: Fallen Order, but it certainly isn\u2019t fixed. Fighting a couple of enemies at a time imparts a terrific feeling of mastery if you\u2019re on top of the all-important parry timing (easier combat difficulties widen the parry window, which says a lot about the mechanic\u2019s significance), and the animations for each of the saber stances feel aesthetically and even kinetically different.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea07e7de-56d0-4736-9f97-a9aacdb26893": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea07e7de-56d0-4736-9f97-a9aacdb26893", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6c7b483-ece2-4feb-a4e0-7ccf1615b01a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c68824fcd96beaa4bb9972bca52efdafd774ac2f20ebe3075e1b4d4f5cf35052"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f966427-8efe-42f4-a27c-077919fd0c1e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e43b2ebd004f56abc1b7453638bb546def21eef3edf1ba2e32441d8ca92bc8bd"}}, "hash": "9236369f9241b0633fec4b19db6bb0e4c48ddcd668b287019b9f2a0a8f195411", "text": "In the piratelike Blaster stance, Cal attacks with rapid, fencing-esque jabs interspersed with offhand gunplay, while the heavy and powerful strikes of the claymorelike Crossguard stance have a genuine heft to them.As the game wears on, though, the battles in which you\u2019re pitted against a horde of enemies \u2014 with a melee swarm steadily hammering your block meter, and laser fire breaking your combos from afar \u2014 continually become more frequent, and those fights are intolerable. This is to say nothing of bosses. They usually aren\u2019t so bad on the default Jedi Knight difficulty, but some of the late-game multistage boss fights really, really tested my patience. Each successive phase made my window to attack increasingly small, while the boss\u2019s attack strings (often with unblockable attacks doing massive damage) got longer and longer.At its worst, Jedi: Survivor\u2019s combat felt like a chore preventing me from enjoying the parts of the game I liked, which is to say, literally everything else. As a saving grace, however, Respawn places meditation spots \u2014 the game\u2019s equivalent of Dark Souls\u2019 bonfires \u2014 thoughtfully enough that you\u2019re never stuck doing a combat gauntlet and a boss fight back to back.One of the metrics I use for reviewing a game, in terms of its quality, is \u201chow much time do I spend thinking about it when I\u2019m not specifically on task for the review?\u201d Jedi: Survivor clocked pretty high on that front in the six days I spent with it. I was invested in the characters; I wanted to explore each planet, and see what was out there. I wanted to recruit more colorful space rogues to Pyloon\u2019s Saloon, Cal\u2019s informal base on Koboh. There was a lot left untouched.If I plan on seeing this guy again, though... ground rules, for sure. I played Jedi: Survivor on the default difficulty for review purposes, but I probably would have had a lot more fun on an easier setting. This way, I could have focused on what the game was doing well: the exploration, the parkour, the characters, the locations, and the combat animations, like the ones that make Jedi in the films and TV series so cool to watch.So, did Jedi: Survivor sweep me off my feet? Am I about to introduce him to my mom, and talk about getting a condo? Probably not. For starters, we need to discuss that beard before there\u2019s any talk of moving in together. That said, if he hit me up again for a second date? That\u2019s an easy yes, provided that I\u2019m picking where we go. A healthy relationship is about boundaries, after all.

A lot has happened since then, and now a sequel, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, is back with more, more, and more.A lot of the edge Fallen Order had isn\u2019t here, but that\u2019s a product of time; AAA games playing footsie with Dark Souls was more novel back then. Instead, developer Respawn Entertainment took what worked before and went all in, stomping on the gas and fully committing to the story and characters we met before. Survivor feels huge, dense, and super got-dang expensive, and after just a few hours of playing the game\u2019s action-packed intro on Coruscant (I skipped that part during the press preview), its heart-stopping 150GB download size started making sense.Despite playing for around 30 hours before seeing Survivor\u2019s credits, I ended up leaving much of its world(s) unexplored.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f966427-8efe-42f4-a27c-077919fd0c1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f966427-8efe-42f4-a27c-077919fd0c1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea07e7de-56d0-4736-9f97-a9aacdb26893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9236369f9241b0633fec4b19db6bb0e4c48ddcd668b287019b9f2a0a8f195411"}, "3": {"node_id": "cbf7956d-2cf8-4197-a312-4826066a0fc7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d9a6f9b382d26b089f5bb7b342089ca3723e645866f937d0edbfa7681cc225f"}}, "hash": "e43b2ebd004f56abc1b7453638bb546def21eef3edf1ba2e32441d8ca92bc8bd", "text": "This is an ambitious Metroidvania that straddles the line between meticulous level design and open-world map game, that also desperately wants to tell a profound Star Wars story about found family, faulty institutions, and the personal costs of resistance. You also get to chat with a Scottish slug-man about fishing, maintain a garden on the roof of a grungy saloon, and play dress-up with Cameron Monaghan. I definitely felt the bloat at times (especially near the end), but between the effective emotional core at the narrative\u2019s heart and the game\u2019s fast and heavy platforming action, Survivor showed up ready to work.We\u2019re reunited with Cal Kestis five years after the events of Fallen Order, and it\u2019s not exactly a happy reunion. The Scooby Gang from the first game has broken up, due to events only hinted at in the game. The novel Battle Scars from Sam Maggs fills in those blanks, but you don\u2019t need to know exactly what happened to understand it probably sucked. Cal, now piloting Greez Dritus\u2019 Mantis ship by himself, has been working with Saw Gerrera to undermine the Empire at every opportunity, but is struggling with a lack of results. But before he can contend with burnout, he\u2019s forced to crash-land on backwater planet Koboh after a mission goes sour and the Mantis is damaged.On Koboh, not only is Cal reunited with Greez, he stumbles into a conflict that\u2019s been brewing since the days of the High Republic. Throughout the story Cal is forced to confront the dark side of the Jedi Order (figuratively and literally), and reconcile a looming fissure between wanting to stand up to the Empire and a growing desire to build a life with his found family. Star Wars\u2019 longstanding theme of balance on an existential scale runs parallel with the more human conundrum of finding (and even defining) value in balance on a personal level. And to its credit, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is honest enough to grasp at a bunch of questions and answer \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d in a way that feels genuine rather than like the kind of fence-sitting that games at this scale tend to lean into.The skeleton holding all that narrative muscle together is an interstellar Metroidvania adventure comprising several locations, but none as massive as Koboh. Introduced as a rural backwater full of prospectors and criminals, Koboh becomes a bustling hub that not only houses the bulk of Survivor\u2019s side content, but also acts as a sort of funnel toward major story beats. It\u2019s an interesting vibe, almost like Metroid Prime minus the jarring biome shifts. Excursions to other locations vary in size and scope, as Survivor\u2019s story isn\u2019t structured the same way Fallen Order\u2019s was in terms of locations as \u201clevels,\u201d so to speak.Read More: The 10 Best Star Wars Games Ever MadeWeirdly enough I found this approach reminiscent of Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia (shoutouts to the OoE sickos out there). I\u2019ve seen disappointment from peers on this part, since exploring different planets was a big attraction in the first game. But I appreciated Survivor\u2019s focus on building up a singular location in the Metroidvania tradition, with the additional locations adding variety and flavor without demanding proportionate time investment, especially since Survivor has a slight padding problem in its later hours, during which I felt the escalating story was interrupted by chunks of \u201cgameplay for the sake of gameplay.\u201d It was frustrating to be so invested in the goings-on just to come to a screeching halt to deal with an hour of bouncing around on space balloons.You may not be running around a bunch of different planets, but there\u2019s certainly no lack of running around to do. And it feels great to do so, even if there were times I wanted the game to just get on with it and wrap up a few hours earlier. I may have resented those space balloons for impeding my path to the ending, but I have to admit they were fun. Cal Kestis is a hell of an acrobat in Jedi: Survivor, with much more speed and weight to his movements than in Fallen Order. He\u2019s also more capable from the get-go, instead of forcing you to slog through the usual trope of having to re-learn everything.With a bag of new tricks to learn along the way, some truly badass setpieces are spun around what can be boiled down to a nerdy guy jumping on rocks. There\u2019s one sequence in particular that would unfortunately anger the Spoiler Police to get into, but it follows a notably excruciating puzzle and was so sick I completely forgave the game entirely for its heinous crime.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbf7956d-2cf8-4197-a312-4826066a0fc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbf7956d-2cf8-4197-a312-4826066a0fc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f966427-8efe-42f4-a27c-077919fd0c1e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e43b2ebd004f56abc1b7453638bb546def21eef3edf1ba2e32441d8ca92bc8bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "eeeebdcf-95c3-42e2-8658-31220513b22b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "71707bb98540e93999f14cb3483a148f155f6e0ce9249193c67798dd736283c2"}}, "hash": "4d9a6f9b382d26b089f5bb7b342089ca3723e645866f937d0edbfa7681cc225f", "text": "It\u2019s a testament to how rock-solid Survivor\u2019s fundamentals are.Perhaps predictably, Survivor is less rock-solid on a technical level. It\u2019s important to note I was playing a review build of the game ahead of a day-one patch, and I imagine whatever problems that persist after that will eventually be smoothed over as well. Nevertheless, throughout my time with the PlayStation 5 version I experienced a routinely unstable frame rate, multiple crashes, and occasional glitchy tomfoolery (mostly the fun kind). I\u2019ve heard each version has its own set of performance woes, but you\u2019ll have to seek out individual perspectives on that front. Overall though, after fiddling with my TV and settling the game to favor a solid 30fps over an unstable 60fps, things were fine far more often than not. A game this massive is gonna come with rough edges out of the gate, and it could have been a lot worse, at least on PS5.\"\u201cWhat am I fighting forrrrr?\u201dAction-adventure Metroidvania Soulslike with light role-playing elements.Grounded storytelling, satisfying gameplay/exploration/combat mechanics, tons of Stuff to Do, good jokes.Late-game padding, performance issues, 150GB are you kidding me?!Respawn EntertainmentPS5 (played on), Xbox Series X/S, PCApril 28, 2023Roughly 30 hours, finished the main story.What really stands out to me after playing Star Wars Jedi: Survivor all the way through is how it manages to tell what feels like a focused, grounded story about a single person. If you sift through all the messiness inherent to such a massive project, you can really see all the effort put into making Cal Kestis not just a more interesting character to play as, but making his presence felt in this universe. Star Wars prequels often suffer from having to reset the board, so to speak, because everything has to lead to the \u201cEveryone is Dead\u201d setting established in the movies. There\u2019s some of that here of course, but the writers found a clever way to subvert it, with a conflict that doesn\u2019t need to have galaxy-shattering ramifications to feel crucial for both the characters and the player.All the problems Star Wars Jedi: Survivor has are clearly and unsurprisingly tied to its ridiculous scope. There\u2019s stuff piled on top of stuff, and not all of it feels substantial, fully baked, or in some cases functional. But the foundation Respawn laid in Fallen Order is still here, and everything about Survivor that\u2019s connected really shines. The characters are more fleshed out and their conflicts are compelling and relatable. The level design is appreciably authored in that way that makes \u201cMetroidvania\u201d a stupid-looking word that means so much. And when it comes to combat, there are so many different ways to brutalize droids and Stormtroopers, the combo video community will feast for years to come. It\u2019s a hearty stew, even if you still have to watch the sodium.\nDestructoid, darkStar Wars is such a complicated beast in 2023. I say that a lot as a general critique about long-running franchises, but rights-holders did this to themselves as a result of oversaturation.On one hand, you have creators striving to move the series forward (and away from the Skywalkers) with\u00a0the meticulously-crafted and brilliant\u00a0Andor series. On the other, you have\u2026whatever the sequel trilogy was. But there\u2019s a middle ground for pulpy stories involving Jedi; combining the youthful spirit of adventure that George Lucas was known for while injecting some modern nuance into the mix. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor manages to walk that tightrope while improving on its predecessor mechanically.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (PC, PS5 [reviewed], Xbox Series X/S) Developer: Respawn Entertainment Publisher: Electronic Arts Release: April 28, 2023 MSRP: $69.99I dug\u00a0Jedi: Fallen Order at launch, but was able to clearly recognize its shortcomings. Some of those were addressed after launch, but you can\u2019t deny that some elements of the original had an air of sterility to them; like someone was checking boxes on a \u201cStar Wars\u00a0Souls-like\u201d directive from on high. The best way I can describe the sequel is that the team seems to have jettisoned that notion of being chained to a singular vision; adding in decades of character-action history while doing its own thing, while micro-managing the larger Star Wars universe.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eeeebdcf-95c3-42e2-8658-31220513b22b": {"__data__": {"id_": "eeeebdcf-95c3-42e2-8658-31220513b22b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "cbf7956d-2cf8-4197-a312-4826066a0fc7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4d9a6f9b382d26b089f5bb7b342089ca3723e645866f937d0edbfa7681cc225f"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7d8c1c7-4cb8-43ef-acf5-eebc39461e65", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f9d1917990ffb84c7115643a571a437d70f59aa94eeb275e55b1a7927c4e0f68"}}, "hash": "71707bb98540e93999f14cb3483a148f155f6e0ce9249193c67798dd736283c2", "text": "It\u2019s a tall order.Cal (played again by Shameless alum Cameron Monaghan) is back, and although he\u2019s aged up five years, you can customize that beard right off his face and feel like you never missed a beat from Fallen Order. That\u2019s mostly a good thing because Survivor starts immediately in the thick of it: with a \u201cChewbacca prisoner\u201d type situation on the ever-popular Star Wars locale of Coruscant. You\u2019ll miss some backstory and some interpersonal storytelling with returning characters if you jump right into Survivor, but there\u2019s no lengthy and drawn-out intro here (unless you want to watch the short recap video), as Cal has access to most of his core powers from the prior game and is able to kick more ass straight away. It makes for a much smoother transition out of the gate.There are also more opportunities for Cameron Monaghan to play off of the material in Survivor without all of the table setting from the first adventure. Monaghan, as he did effortlessly in many\u00a0Shameless storylines, is able to navigate those mixed feelings of insecurity and anger, as we see Cal deal with them in real time. If you don\u2019t like Cal\u2019s Everyman portrayal in the first game you probably won\u2019t warm up to it here, but by character action game standards, I was invested in seeing what happened next to him and his crew.Of course, there are some cheesy/fan servicey moments, and some creatures within that would definitely be sold as plushies if they were in a bad\u00a0Star Wars movie. But the story as a whole is a reminder that you can do Force-centric stories without putting the core focus on the Skywalker family.The decision not to redo everything and give Cal some powers immediately was smart. A double jump, wall run, and an Ascension (grappling) cable in the early game amounts to a lot of versatility when it comes to platforming, and perfect parrying/dodging feels smooth in the sequel. Later on, you unlock perks (passives) that can be slotted in to augment or change up your playstyle, as well as some larger mechanical developments like air dashing.My favorite aspect of the sequel has to be the open-ended expansion of lightsaber options. The stoic single saber is available at the start alongside the double-bladed option (which is built for crowd control); but you\u2019ll also gain access to a dual-wield aggressive stance, as well as a blaster style, and a bulky but powerful crossguard style. The best part? There\u2019s a Devil May Cry Dante swapping between two styles of your choice using the left and right d-pad.You can go all-out with access to two offensive styles, or plan out different encounters with a mix of options. I enjoyed the blaster style\u00a0immensely and had it equipped the entire time, and the concept of requiring players to strike enemies with a lightsaber to refill ammo is brilliant: in that it forces a non-passive approach to what is ostensibly a ranged combat style. The combat system thrives in group fights, especially as you\u2019re wielding your force powers and blocking errant blast shots. Bosses are flashy, but can blend together with similar attacks and tactics (which typically heavily favor parrying, breaking their guard, then striking).From a technical standpoint, my pre-release build had some issues on PS5. I experienced two crashes, which thankfully were during cutscenes\u00a0directly after a save (so I missed 30 seconds of total progress across both of them). I also encountered two areas where framerate drops were apparent (one of which was the main hub), even in performance mode: but never during major confrontations or even battle/platforming-heavy sections. Several doors took multiple seconds to load, which led me to believe there was a slight glitch at one point. There are some minor pop-in issues during cutscenes, and I was instructed to turn HDR support off before launch. Although Respawn notes that these problems will be addressed in a day one patch, I wanted to be as transparent as possible.While the original\u00a0Jedi game had shades of\u00a0Star Wars,\u00a0Survivor is drenched in Star Wars theming. In a good way! The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, to the point where it\u2019s movie-worthy quality. It elevates everything, from the action scenes to the drama, and some of the more adrenaline-pumping beats wouldn\u2019t work as well without it.The environments are fantastically crafted, and you can tell the team really cares about the\u00a0Star Wars mythos as you check out various flora and fauna inhabiting the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7d8c1c7-4cb8-43ef-acf5-eebc39461e65": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7d8c1c7-4cb8-43ef-acf5-eebc39461e65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "eeeebdcf-95c3-42e2-8658-31220513b22b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "71707bb98540e93999f14cb3483a148f155f6e0ce9249193c67798dd736283c2"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7eebba5-e20f-45ed-9192-41cad40342fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2021c6103e6b3da5a50276727d38e791ad2fba41e1299fb207edefdb4f06b2eb"}}, "hash": "f9d1917990ffb84c7115643a571a437d70f59aa94eeb275e55b1a7927c4e0f68", "text": "This sequel universe feels a lot more alive as a result, and if you\u2019re remotely into the\u00a0Star Wars lore, there\u2019s extra stuff to glom onto here.\u00a0 Platforming can feel off sometimes, and some portions of the map don\u2019t \u201ccatch\u201d correctly when you\u2019re jumping toward them. In those cases I respawned instantly nearby and tried another tact: it never got to the point where it was boiling over levels of frustration. There are plenty of gamey moments like riding on beasts (including one that functions as a Yoshi-like mount that you can jump off of), but that\u2019s distinctly a justified Star Wars trait in the vein of Lucas\u2019 reign.Crazily enough, there are a few areas that feel like direct homages to dungeons from Twilight Princess\u00a0(you\u2019ll know it when you see it). Far more than the first game, you can tell there are action game fans at the helm.Navigation can be unclear (even with accessibility options turned on), but I actually like that. Remember when I talked about Survivor being less sterile? The platforming options really help the sequel stand out. I found myself getting completely distracted for hours at a time attempting challenges and new routes; sometimes mistaking them for the critical path. It\u2019s a true testament to how well a lot of the areas are designed, as it was easy to get lost and not feel like I was going down an obvious \u201cside path.\u201dAfter you\u2019re done with the campaign there\u2019s a New Game+ (NG+) mode available right at launch, with toggles for extra damage for both Cal and enemies (Heaven Or Hell from Devil May Cry), remixed and tougher enemy layouts (popularized by action classics like Ninja Gaiden Black), and a cosmetic randomizer that triggers after every death.I only Platinum a few games a year, but I\u2019m considering going the distance for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor \u2014 that\u2019s how much I liked it, and I would have scored it higher if the technical concerns weren\u2019t in play. After finishing up Jedi Survivor and immediately cleaning up what I had missed for fun, I found myself wishing for a world where Respawn Entertainment focused all of its energy on single player games from here on out.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

This is a continuation of the story players experienced back in 2019 that builds upon the character of Cal Kestis and his motley crew as they try to not only stage a rebellion against the Empire, but survive all manner of threat.

Cal Kestis is striking at the Empire however he can with his new crew after his old ragtag bunch went their separate ways. After a bit of trouble, Cal is once again fleeing, this time with the goal of bringing his crew back together to not only work at taking down the tyrannical Empire, but to find a safe haven for other Jedi on a planet called Tanalorr.Cal\u2019s character has grown quite a bit from the first game. Though he can still be a bit bland at times, he\u2019s a rational protagonist with clear goals and is, amazingly, in-touch with his emotions. He understands his own limitations, tries valiantly to work through them, all while empathizing with others\u2019 plights and goals.The main antagonist, Dagan Gera, plays well off of Cal\u2019s own fears and goals. Both are obsessed with reaching Tanalorr, though their reasoning differs. It\u2019s through this motivation that they can see a piece of themselves in the other and all the emotional turmoil that comes along with it.Unfortunately, there are some inconsistencies with the story and character motivations. Cal tries to keep his identity a secret lest the Empire come and endanger those he cares about and yet, within the first few moments of arriving on the friendly world of Koboh, he lets a bad guy walk off. Seconds later, he asks a new ally to keep it hush-hush that he\u2019s on the planet.Toward the end, a few character motivations fell apart and illogical decisions were made. Some of these decisions appear to go directly against Jedi teachings. It left me puzzled, questioning why these established characters would act in such a way. By the time the credits rolled, I didn\u2019t feel content with how the story wrapped up.The discontent with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor\u2019s narrative also seeps into the gameplay. For those that focus on the story and leave exploration for later, the back and forth between locations becomes painfully obvious. Cal is just everyone\u2019s go-to man, \u201cGo to here, and then go to there.\u201d You\u2019ll just finish a mission chasing the next McGuffin and you\u2019ll need to go back to the previous planet or the base of operations, Koboh.Thankfully, Koboh as a hub world feels great to explore. It\u2019s basically southern US of A in space. Most characters have a drawl, there\u2019s a ranch, and the moment you sweep into town on a cloud of dust, you\u2019re fighting out front of a saloon. It\u2019s a welcoming place, ignoring the obvious threats lurking in the avenues and ravines that are begging to be explored.And explore you will, especially as you return with new abilities that grant you access to previously unreachable locations. These new areas could hold dungeons that ask you to solve some Force-based puzzle or tough monsters to fight, and all seem to reward you with a chest containing a health or Force upgrade, or even a cosmetic.Truthfully, I don\u2019t usually give two credits about cosmetics in single player, story-driven video games, but Star Wars had other plans for me. One chest in the early parts of the game contained one of the best hairdos a bloke from Australia could want. I had secured a mullet. Cameron Monaghan looks pretty great in a mullet and I now feel both represented and passionate about cosmetics.There are a host of improvements upon the first game that Respawn included in Survivor. Firstly, the map is significantly improved in both legibility and use. Terrain elements are now blocky with less cluttered details, with elevation changes clearly defined. While it does feel weird to change and rotate the camera around \u2013 almost as though the focal point is below or behind the map \u2013 you can now fast travel to locations via the mediation points. It speeds up the exploration and cuts down on the need to repeat the restrictive traversal areas.Many of the first game\u2019s abilities, weapons, and moves return for the sequel. Cal can use one lightsaber, two separated lightsabers, Darth Maul-style double-ended saber, and his Force abilities. As the story progresses, you\u2019ll acquire some new weapon options including a blaster-lightsaber combo that spices up the combat and everything can be expanded through the upgrade system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9cf7235-cc6a-421e-beae-29eb123cb6dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9cf7235-cc6a-421e-beae-29eb123cb6dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7eebba5-e20f-45ed-9192-41cad40342fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2021c6103e6b3da5a50276727d38e791ad2fba41e1299fb207edefdb4f06b2eb"}, "3": {"node_id": "09cd0237-a7a6-4f67-9b47-460f0c50c298", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "006f555b9f8a4aa246110b8a25160d2941f8793d53004c60b990811361420218"}}, "hash": "a020efba92616249c76005fd3443951544edf31ea18a0be3b76498eda7ff9ee1", "text": "Plus, the lightsabers can now, literally, disarm opponents, slicing off human limbs and cleanly cauterizing the wounds.As you fight through the campaign, some of your companions will join you, offering their unique abilities into the mix. Merrin can lock down foes with her magic while Bode, a new jetpack-using fella, can throw down stun grenades. It\u2019s a nice addition that can help turn the tide of battle, especially on the harder difficulties.Survivor introduces a wealth of other characters to enrich the world. Found while you explore, these characters will return to Koboh\u2019s town center and open up shop. Any materials you find while exploring can be traded for cosmetics or even perks, equippable items that improve or alter some aspects of Cal\u2019s repertoire of tools. Some of these characters are simply there to flavor the experience, like Turgle, a gangly, bumbling, frog-like alien whom I instantly fell in love with. I would kill for you Turgle.For every positive addition, there still exist some of the woes I held with the first game. The movement, though flashy, never reaches its full potential outside of the predetermined traversal sections. These sections are still restrictive, requiring players to string together specific moves along a set path. It\u2019s unfortunate, because you\u2019re given all these moves like a grapple and dash, but you\u2019re never unleashed within a playpen to use them freely. Arenas will have curved walls and other bits hanging from the ceiling, but you\u2019re fighting on the ground.The combat tends to feel quite samey after a while. It\u2019s still a treat to carve through droids and Stormtroopers with ease, especially in the few times the game throws large groups at you, but more often than not you\u2019re whittling away at stamina bars. When at its best, the fighting can be rewarding, especially against bosses, but when above-average mobs require multiple stamina bar breaks, it starts to get repetitive.You\u2019ll whittle down a stamina bar, get in a few choice hits, and then need to back off. This in and out method is repeated until the foe is out of health, and then it\u2019s on to the next above average foe. Sekiro got this right, rewarding you with a one-hit deathblow if you could reduce the stamina gauge. In Survivor, every foe with a stamina bar has the potential to turn into a drawn out fight thanks to their quick recharge.Using the Force is always a joy, especially when you can push, pull, and hold enemies up in the air. Unfortunately, many of the stronger combatants are completely unconcerned by your attempts at telekensis. Even after upgrading, you must still go through the process of whittling down their stamina for a brief moment of control. It can be unsatisfying and leaves you feeling more like a padawan than a Jedi that\u2019s been fighting non-stop for five years.For all the good, there was also the bad, and my time playing on PC was marred by a few issues. There were frequent frame rate hiccups in combat and texture pop-ins during cutscenes. I also experienced a couple of crashes and the final boss sunk into the ground, breaking the encounter, and required a restart to get it to work.As a user that enjoys a good Y-axis inversion, when it\u2019s not implemented well my whole world crumbles. Though the camera is inverted when controlling Cal, it\u2019s not when looking at the map, gliding on one of the bird creatures, or aiming laser devices to solve puzzles.For all the high points the story told, the cutscenes unfortunately undermined the efforts. The cinematics were almost unwatchable. Dialogue would stutter, stop, repeat, and play over the top of other lines. Emotional story beats were made unintentionally hilarious. A Day 0 patch promises to fix this, and I hold out hope that it does, but this is the game I was given to review.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a marked improvement upon the first game, despite suffering from some of the woes I had with the 2019 title. Cal Kestis\u2019 journey across the galaxy is fraught with danger and the supporting cast are a treat to chat with whether in the midst of a mission or as you explore Koboh. While the combat and movement is still quintessentially Star Wars, it feels like the game has yet to reach its full potential. The good news is that, if you\u2019re a Star Wars fan, you\u2019re going to have a great time in this galaxy.This review is based on a Steam key provided by the publisher.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09cd0237-a7a6-4f67-9b47-460f0c50c298": {"__data__": {"id_": "09cd0237-a7a6-4f67-9b47-460f0c50c298", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9cf7235-cc6a-421e-beae-29eb123cb6dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a020efba92616249c76005fd3443951544edf31ea18a0be3b76498eda7ff9ee1"}, "3": {"node_id": "18cfc7fe-04b9-44d5-953a-f0488d0a3a3f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f2f74a1039a775cbf8b899484af52cf2103d5e80f289415283135bdcfe580ee"}}, "hash": "006f555b9f8a4aa246110b8a25160d2941f8793d53004c60b990811361420218", "text": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is scheduled to release on April 28, 2023 on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.Hailing from the land down under, Sam Chandler brings a bit of the southern hemisphere flair to his work.

With AAA production flair, the game blended a very '90s Star Wars expanded universe setup with the scale of a modern action-adventure game to great effect. The sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor significantly ups its predecessor\u2019s scale, continuing Cal Kestis' story while expanding the suite of Jedi powers and worlds to explore.In many ways, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the best of both worlds for classic and modern Star Wars. By blending the focus on a traditional galaxy-hopping adventure with the sprawling scope of a AAA adventure game, the follow-up to Fallen Order succeeds in offering a compelling and dense universe to explore. Although this sequel has some rough edges that can dull its main story, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a confident sequel that shows off the best of what a Star Wars game can aspire to be.As the second story of a Star Wars trilogy, Survivor keeps with the franchise's tradition of taking the characters and plot into darker territory. Picking up five years after the end of Fallen Order, Cal Kestis is now a full-fledged rebel and Jedi knight who has become one of the galaxy's most wanted. After a botched mission on Coruscant, Cal escapes to the frontier planet Koboh, leading to a new adventure where he unearths lost artifacts from the early days of the Jedi Order, builds new alliances, and reunites with old friends as he continues his fight against the Empire.Survivor focuses on Cal Kestis' growth as a Jedi knight and the bonds he forms\u2014and breaks\u2014with the characters he encounters. The game\u2019s story presents a generally introspective look at what a Jedi must do to survive in the galaxy's darkest times.That comes through in the way Cal bends the rules of how a Jedi is expected to operate, an interesting story angle that plays out as plot threads unravel throughout the game. Though Cal still comes off as a bit of a plain protagonist during interactions with the more interesting and personable characters in the game, he possesses an endearing and likable sense of hope through it all.What I enjoyed most about the sequel's expanded scope is how it pulls plot threads and lore from different eras of Star Wars to bolster Cal's story. This isn't to say that this sequel is another round of \u201cgreatest hits\u201d that many other franchise games tend to be. Rather, it uses common details from the prequel and original trilogy eras to add context to Cal's story.Survivor's plot also leans heavily into lore from The High Republic, a recent series of books focused on the golden age of the Jedi Order. This forms an intriguing core part of the main story, with the highly principled age of the High Republic contrasting nicely with the morally gray era of the Galactic Civil War.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

Being a terrorist is hard work, and no amount of lightsaber amputations is making him any happier. In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, you follow his excellent adventure in reaching out to old friends, desperately trying to find new ones when the OG cast inevitably remember he\u2019s a melt, and cramming as many seeds and rocks into his pockets as the force allows.The latest triple-A action game from Apex Legends factory Respawn Entertainment, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the sequel to a surprising hit from 2019 which follows everyone\u2019s favourite ginger hero as he performs outrageous feats roughly a bazillion miles away from any canon film. The first game managed to please the crowds by mixing a few Soulsian mechanics with a tasting menu of Star Wars\u2019 most iconic aspects. We\u2019re talking lightsabers, pushing storm troopers off cliffs, and a narrative focused on rebellion and importance of believing in the good of the universe. The stuff people have been lapping up for decades.With the sequel, I went in with higher expectations. The team at Respawn did a damn good job last time around, both at making a great action game, and a great Star Wars product. After dozens of hours in the sequel, I do believe the studio has raised the cantina on both accounts.We\u2019ll begin with the bread and butter. If there\u2019s one thing that Jedi: Survivor does especially well, it\u2019s make the act of swinging your lightsaber around incredibly engaging. Even at the start of the game, Cal plays like an experienced Jedi, able to split a Stormtrooper in two and push enemies off cliffs. It was smart to start you off with a decent toybox of attacks to mess around with, and thanks to expansive skill trees you are able to quickly empower yourself further.On to this foundation, you add lightsaber stances, which dramatically alter how you play. It\u2019s tricky to nail the feel of a lightsaber (moreso than general sword combat in my opinion)  because you can grab 10 nerds from a crowd at the Star Wars Celebration and they\u2019ll naturally tear each other's throats out over how slow lightsabers should be, how heavy they should feel, and which types of the weapons are for losers.So it\u2019s brilliant news to all of those dorks (yes, myself included) that each style is not only fun to mess around with in its own way, but also plays differently, too. You wanna mash that attack button super fast? Dual sabers is for you. Wanna sweep around and take out waves of droids at once? Darth Maul-style double-sided for you, mate. Are you 50+? Grab that single saber like you did at the movie screenings back in the day. And there are more, too, one of which is my favourite and led to my first skill tree reset \u2013 but I won\u2019t spoil it. It\u2019s just a shame that experimenting with stances costs skill points; it seems to punish you for wanting to try all the options out.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is probably the most fun I\u2019ve had in a Star Wars game since The Force Unleashed. Though Survivor has nowhere near the levels of fanfiction-esque insanity that made those old games so enjoyable, it can make you feel as rad as Unleashed did \u2013 which is a feat considering you aren\u2019t pulling Star Destroyers out of the sky or slamming Obi-Wan into a blender.As for traversal, Jedi: Survivor is huge and smothered in puzzles and hidden junk. The moment you land on Koboh and start striking out across the map, you begin to get a glimpse at how daunting the task of gathering everything is. You don\u2019t have to, of course, but the game excels at tempting you to find one more treasure before moving on with the story. Multiple gadgets and unlockable abilities have you returning back to old zones often, scratching off dead ends scouring the world for loot.At times, it goes a bit overboard. I saw that there were 100 Priorite shards, and I prepped for the long haul. I saw there were 145 seeds, and I leaned back with a sigh.

That depends on what parts of the Disney-owned giga-franchise you value most! If it\u2019s the laser fights then, yeah, Respawn nails it. Do you like freaky aliens, adventuring around exotic worlds, and helping your freaky friends beat away The Empire? Jedi: Survivor does that well, too! It takes a recipe from the Lucas and co. cookbook and replicates it faithfully, whilst making sure to throw in a few extra ingredients here and there to just keep things fresh.Respawn made sure to immediately show off how much it digs the IP from the second you touch down on Coruscant, and that succeeded at putting a smile on my face. But it wasn\u2019t until I ran into Pyloon\u2019s Saloon that I knew the studio managed to pull it off with aplomb. It\u2019s your typical Star Wars canteen \u2013 albeit with enough new ideas to not put you immediately to sleep. This is endemic of the game as a whole, which is one of Survivor\u2019s greatest successes in my mind.Oh god, it has such a sense of humour at times, too. Enemies chirp at each other, common droids will self-monologue with wit. You know it\u2019s working when you find yourself stopping and waiting for enemy dialogue to finish before jumping in and murdering them. But it goes further than speech: Respawn will place enemies by ledges and cliff faces as if begging you to comedically push them off. When you grab and throw a droid miles away, it\u2019ll shout goodbye as it flies into the distance. There's one gag later on in the game that had me rolling, that I frankly cannot spoil. And I wouldn't, even if I could.Respawn nails the aesthetic. The composers bring the horns and strings you\u2019ve grown to expect from Star Wars elegantly into the mix, too. Everyone on the team who worked on the skyboxes deserves a raise, a firm handshake, and a staggering number of high fives. Character designers, level designers... everyone on the team has outdone themselves here.The game has a performance mode and I ran into occasional frame drops even with it on, but for the most part the game ran A-OK. You can catch a rare floating beam or bugged out droid here and there, but these weren\u2019t game breaking, or rough enough to tear out my sense of enjoyment at the time. I had one crash after mixing up the lightsaber parts as fast as I could, but I was really trying to push it there. In terms of other issues? Gimmie a red lightsaber crystal. If lore reasons mattered, you wouldn\u2019t give me a purple or white one. I get that red = bad in cinematics, but if the player equips it manually it\u2019s their fault if they get confused. C\u2019mon.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a step up from its predecessor and brilliant fun, as long as you don\u2019t let that collectible-obssessed plunderer take hold of you. It is not a narrative masterpiece, nor is it the most engaging action game in the world. But it does nothing badly, and excels where it matters. It represents the Star Wars universe accurately and places emphasis on the aspects of it that keep even jaded Andor-lovers like me interested in the IP, even after all this time. An obvious recommendation to Star Wars fans, and a hearty thumbs up to anyone else that may be even remotely interested.If you want to buy the game yourself, you can do so here via the link below!

Star Wars Jedi: Survivor explores the Empire\u2019s hold on the galaxy while offering a personal story that, in my opinion, is one of the most exciting we\u2019ve seen in a long time, further building Cal into a force to be reckoned with without relying on the wider Star Wars universe to keep fans interested.Set five years after the events of Fallen Order, Cal is no longer with his friends aboard the Mantis. Greez in running a bar on the wild planet of Koboh, Cere is trying to preserve the Jedi Order on Jedha, and Merrin is nowhere to be found. It\u2019s clear from the beginning that he\u2019s a much more experienced and feared Jedi, with many of his force abilities still present from the previous title. It was something I hoped Respawn didn\u2019t abandon, making you relearn skills due to some arbitrary story beat that made him forget. Thankfully, those powerful abilities are part of your skillset from the start, yet there\u2019re still plenty of new ones to learn as the story progresses.Much like Fallen Order, new abilities unlock and allow you to revisit locations in the game that were previously locked. Dashing through electrified green doors and across chasms, ripping down probe droids and large crates with the force, and more traversal abilities unlock, as well as using BD-1 in new ways. Not only do these new skills aid you along the way, they compliment wall-running, and force push and pulling to give you plenty of freedom and options to get around. The level design is excellent, whether you\u2019re exploring the huge hub world of Koboh or taking on the Empire in one of their bases in the deep recesses of the galaxy.When in combat, Cal will unlock new stances that can be changed at Meditation Points, then two can be swapped at any given time by pressing left or right on the D-pad. There\u2019re five in total, and while single-bladed and double-bladed lightsabers make up two of these, it\u2019s the new ones that enhance combat in different ways. One of which is the Crossguard, turning your lightsaber into the one similar to Kylo Ren\u2019s in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. It\u2019s slower than Cal\u2019s standard lightsaber, but deals great damage in one-on-one combat. The other stance lets you hold your standard lightsaber as well as a blaster, offering great range with firepower from a distance. All of your stances can be upgraded, with skill points used to add new moves and abilities to each one.Skill points can also be used to improve Cal\u2019s mind control of enemies, how much life you regenerate, and more. The three branches of Force, Survival, and Lightsaber give you an ever-expanding skillset which will be vital to take down all the scum and villainy you\u2019ll encounter. There\u2019re tons of enemies to face in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, each with their own specific attack patterns, and you\u2019ll always need to change your approach on the fly. I would liked to have been able to switch between all five stances in a fight, but two is often enough, at least in the first half of the game where enemies aren\u2019t as vast in any given battle. Stormtroopers, battle droids, Bedlam Raiders, the Haxion Brood, rancors, and other legendary bosses fill every corner of the galaxy, and you\u2019ll constantly be making use of everything you\u2019ve learned.Another new feature that\u2019ll aid you in battle is the Perk system. Each one can offer a permanent buff as long as it\u2019s equipped, and they can be found in Breath of the Wild-type shrines, in secret areas, and at one of the new shops at Pyloon Saloon, your base of operations on Koboh. Here, you can chat with characters you\u2019ve met and invited during your travels, such as Zee, a droid from the High Republic era, and Caij, a Nautolan who offers rewards for killing Haxion Brood bounty hunters. You\u2019ll start to see Greez\u2019s bar expand with new shops and opportunities, even offering a droid who plays music which, by finding or purchasing new tracks, can be played from the crummy little stage.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "112e7ea7-497c-4f24-a7eb-6ac83d50de0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "112e7ea7-497c-4f24-a7eb-6ac83d50de0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d01cab0-6111-4be1-b9a6-71c10698531a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "102a51e2e801c387ca112a03603d9c0750ca6728a9c74e7514f15df01caa387a"}, "3": {"node_id": "40157f22-df24-4ff2-b846-fa4d02ccb339", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aab1f621bf42a89a2711fe49c098ee27a23e00416e7f937b40d15c30319d589a"}}, "hash": "959db20410d97e9084dd6b074545a4705edefbc8ab982f0e5a3580bbf308979a", "text": "One of the things I enjoyed the most about Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was exploring every nook and cranny.Along with meeting new characters to invite back to the saloon, you\u2019ll find different kinds of currency that can be used to buy new cosmetics, droid and blaster parts, and perks. I headed off the beaten track multiple times to find a secret boss battle or a new area that offered something I hadn\u2019t seen before, as well as some cool surprises and new seeds that I could plant in my very own garden on the roof of the Pyloon Saloon. It pays to explore, and while most of the planets aren\u2019t as large as Koboh, there\u2019s still plenty to do and see. There\u2019s no need to rush through the story, but I did find myself progressing through as I was utterly engrossed with Cal Kestis\u2019 journey to stopping a new kind of threat.The Empire is obviously the biggest threat to the galaxy, but Respawn has managed to incorporate a relatively unexplored pocket of Star Wars history in Survivor that has only been seen in the last five or so years in canon. The High Republic is an age that saw Jedis at the height of their power a few hundred years before the events of Episode I: The Phantom Menace. When you\u2019re introduced to Zee and other characters from this era early on, it opens up so much more of the lore of Star Wars for fans to enjoy, even if you have no idea what a Starlight Beacon is, or who the Nihil are. When you encounter a fallen Jedi called Dagan Gera, the story takes a new direction that only gets better as a greater threat looms on the horizon.I didn\u2019t realise how much I cared about Cal, Greez, Cere, or Merrin until the story takes an unexpected and shocking turn. By the time it was all over, I wanted more from them, and I hope that the wider Star Wars universe incorporates these characters, specifically Cal Kestis, into new TV shows or even one of the recently announced movies. Like Ahsoka Tano and Kanan Jarrus, he\u2019s become a Jedi who has proved to be a fan-favourite without the need to show up in the Skywalker saga. With the Jedi Order no more after Order 66, he is upholding a new way of thinking for the Jedi, proving that old ideals and beliefs don\u2019t always equate to what is right or inherently good. After all, it got them nowhere in the Clone Wars, but I digress.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor tells a fantastic story that grips you throughout. New characters like Bode Akuna are superbly written, and Respawn has made full use of creative freedom to bring in new places, characters, and aliens while not relying on familiar faces to tell a powerful and moving story that always nails the drama and action of the films and shows we already love in the universe. This new canonical tale has plenty of potential to be adapted in other ways, and I truly hope Lucasfilm is paying attention. The possibility of seeing all these characters pop up elsewhere is exciting, and even if they don\u2019t, this game has cemented their rightful place in canon.\u00a0Along with some fantastic voice acting, the sound design is superb, whether in the implementation of familiar sights and sounds of lightsabers whirring or the incessant rambling of the B1 battle droids, or the ambient noises of wildlife or ships flying overhead. Visually, it\u2019s stunning, especially in Quality mode, with only a few texture issues when loading in or out of a cutscene, however, these will be addressed with a Day 1 patch. There are some set pieces in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor that left me speechless. Respawn\u2019s ambition is second-to-none, and to have such a huge game offer so much is a testament to the hard work put in to make this a worthy sequel to Fallen Order.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is going to make a lot of fans happy, whether you\u2019re unfamiliar with the wider Star Wars universe or not. Combat and traversal is sublime, and despite certain boss fights being as tough as Beskar nails, the satisfaction of taking down a legendary enemy feels euphoric. There\u2019s so much to do and see, with a story that grips you until the very end, never taking its foot off the gas and giving you all the thrills and excitement seen in some of the most highly regarded stories fans already know and love.

Your home for all your videogame needs. Reviews, videos, podcast, news: we\u2019ve got the lot: PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox, PC Gaming!\nAttack of the Fanboy, 2019\u2019s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise hit from the FPS-focused Respawn Entertainment, but Cal Kestis\u2019 debut felt very much like a proof of concept for something greater. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is that something.Respawn ditches last-gen hardware for Cal\u2019s sophomore outing to great effect, delivering an exhilarating planet-hopping adventure that really takes the feedback from its predecessor to heart. Survivor is bigger, bolder, and more refined than Fallen Order, but Respawn hasn\u2019t completely nailed everything in its second lap with Star Wars.To start, Jedi: Survivor feels next-gen on all fronts. That\u2019s not just in its stunning vistas, ridiculously detailed environments, and ability to play at 60 FPS in performance mode, but also in the sheer breadth of options available to the player. Cal has several combat stances and force abilities at his disposal, there are an insane amount of side activities and puzzles to partake in, and each planet is massive and bursting at the seams with life. This feels like one of the first games to truly take advantage of next-generation processing power for more than just a facelift.There are three staples of a good video game: grappling hooks, farming minigames, and fishing minigames. Survivor pulls off the hat trick with additional flourishes. Cal gets a grappling hook within the first few minutes of the game, and as anyone with taste knows, every game is better with a grappling hook. Upon reaching the game\u2019s main settlement of Rambler\u2019s Reach \u2014 which grows and attracts new characters throughout the story \u2014 I was delighted to discover a rooftop garden on top of the saloon. \u201cIf this has fishing,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cthen this is surely an all-timer.\u201dReturning to the settlement an hour later after an exciting excursion with droids, danger, and death, I decided to take a load off and chat with the locals. One of them then tipped me off about a rumor, which added a quest to my log: recruit the mysterious fisherman. Those geniuses. All jokes aside, Respawn knows what makes video games work. While Survivor\u2019s seed and fish collectibles aren\u2019t involved in fully-fledged minigames, their presence is emblematic of the game\u2019s breadth of content as a whole. In addition, Respawn avoids the Metroid trope by letting Cal carry all his Fallen Order toys into Survivor, letting the game barrel out of the gate and blast down the aisle with breakneck pacing that never fails to excite.There\u2019s just so much to do when you\u2019re not mainlining the story, and every reward feels worthwhile. An unassuming cave might bring you to a deadly encounter with a legendary creature, a crack in the wall might lead to a small pond where Cal\u2019s fishing friend is casting away, or a platforming puzzle could unlock a spiffy new haircut for Cal. It\u2019s a Star Wars smorgasbord. There\u2019s a galaxy\u2019s worth of content crammed onto every planet and everything is so much easier to navigate than Fallen Order\u2019s labyrinthian locales.Survivor uses the best form of encouragement to get you to engage with its side content: customization. While you can score some extra skill points, healing stims, or force capacity through exploration, the primary reason to stray from the beaten path is unlocking new clothes, hairstyles, parts, and paint jobs for both Cal and BD-1. While it\u2019s a bit disappointing that you might miss out on your favorite output by skipping some random cave, there are a surprising number of customization options for Cal and BD-1 and you can pick up a solid starter wardrobe from planetary vendors (whose currency is also obtained via exploration).In addition to being packed with secrets and rewards, each of Survivor\u2019s planets is a visual feast. From the rugged cliffs of Koboh to the sandy deserts of Jedha, every location is pure photo mode bait.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11b7c5f6-31f1-41e1-9789-e3b0af15353c": {"__data__": {"id_": "11b7c5f6-31f1-41e1-9789-e3b0af15353c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319ea01a-8732-4229-b8c8-69ec13cc8b9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "700c8a32eeb7e9eebe50c652bbdb0ef09f051e8b421622fe76fcb1ee4607f5ac"}, "2": {"node_id": "40157f22-df24-4ff2-b846-fa4d02ccb339", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aab1f621bf42a89a2711fe49c098ee27a23e00416e7f937b40d15c30319d589a"}, "3": {"node_id": "f79567e1-7c19-49b0-b2c5-fe02fdcad66e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "84c85d40ec50e315cbefc1c4aee36c5dc4c6dec00fd27f7b10c31cb932c3e65f"}}, "hash": "9aa5e6fa76ceb6177fe465cc19d7dc4b55f7da7fa671375203ea7e5289ba6056", "text": "If you\u2019re the type that loves to take screenshots, then soaking in the sights and sounds of Jedi: Survivor can easily add hours to your initial playthrough.Unfortunately, the game\u2019s beauty comes at the cost of performance. The performance mode never feels like it holds a steady 60 FPS, and even the 30 FPS quality mode buckles under intense load. This is especially frustrating since the frame drops only seem to happen during tough battles. For example, a duel with a Rancor in a damp cave saw the game\u2019s framerate tank into the teens, forcing me to swap from quality to performance mode just for the game to feel responsive.The game excels when it lets you loose onto a massive plain or desert with a mount to ferry you from nook to cranny as you clear the map. Respawn uses this wide-open level design to patch the cracks in the foundation left over from Fallen Order. When the game funnels you into linear levels in service of the story, however, the otherwise excellent pacing screeches to a halt and Fallen Order\u2019s flaws begin to seep through those cracks.Thankfully, Respawn has addressed the complaints from Fallen Order by adding several shortcuts and enabling fast travel between meditation points, but that\u2019s still not enough to bandage Survivor\u2019s underwhelming level design. More inventive combat arenas and enemy types would\u2019ve done wonders for this game.The story isn\u2019t this game\u2019s strong suit either. Unfortunately, Cal\u2019s journey doesn\u2019t hit as hard as it should. Survivor tackles some interesting topics, namely survivor\u2019s guilt, but it refuses to engage with its themes in any significant way outside of the introduction and final act. Cal and the primary antagonist \u2014 who is in desperate need of more screen time \u2014 are mirror images of one another. Both have complicated feelings about the Jedi Order and themselves for not being able to do more, but they find themselves on diverging paths. Not wrestling harder with their clashing ideologies was a missed opportunity.Cal\u2019s layers of guilt are peeled back through the character-focused scenes sprinkled throughout the story. In typical Star Wars fashion, the main plot revolves around the retrieval of a MacGuffin that lets the good guys beat the bad guys, leaving the characters to do the heavy lifting narratively. Respawn takes full advantage of the Star Wars playground and delivers side characters and companions that are way more inventive than anything else churned out by Star Wars media in recent years.Aside from the familiar faces from the first game like the lovable Greez, humble Cere, and enigmatic Merrin, Survivor introduces a wacky cast of endearing side characters that can be recruited to the game\u2019s central hub town of Rambler\u2019s Reach. This town is already home to people like Turgle, a lovable frog friend that plays the role of the game\u2019s \u201cweird little guy,\u201d but you\u2019ll also be able to check in with a slew of friendly faces every time you return.Cal\u2019s crew is the heart of the story though, and the way he processes his trauma through them is the driving force behind the narrative. Cal is in a very different spot than we left him at the end of Fallen Order, and he\u2019s become riddled with resentment and guilt after the original crew broke up. Survivor\u2019s story is a fairly paint-by-numbers \u201cgetting the gang back together\u201d affair, but watching Cal toe the line between light and dark while his guilt slowly eats away at him is textbook Star Wars, even if the narrative doesn\u2019t dive as deep as it should.In addition, Survivor still hasn\u2019t remedied one of Fallen Order\u2019s most detrimental aspects. Regardless of Cal\u2019s weapon or style, combat still feels mushy. Parries in particular never feel as tight as they should, which is exacerbated even further by the swath of satisfying parries we\u2019ve gotten in games like Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty since the release of Fallen Order. Mixing in force powers and blaster shots makes things much more enjoyable, but the simple act of swinging a saber leaves a lot to be desired.Star Wars Jedi: Survivor builds on the foundation established in Fallen Order and delivers expansive environments crammed with content and secrets. Respawn still falls into some of the same pitfalls that it did in Fallen Order, though, namely in its underwhelming linear sections and middling story.
