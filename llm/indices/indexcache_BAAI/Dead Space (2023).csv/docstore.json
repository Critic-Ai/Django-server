A remake of the 2008 survival horror game Dead Space.\nExpect to pay: $59.99 (Steam)\nDeveloper: Motive\nPublisher: EA\nReviewed on: Windows 10, i5-12400F, 16GB DDR4 Ram, RTX 2060\nMultiplayer: No\nLink: https://www.ea.com/games/dead-space\u00a0\"Twinkle twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are?\" a dying woman sings over the elevator tannoy as I climb through the decks of the doomed ship Ishimura. I'm not a big fan of that whole nursery rhyme horror cliche, but it fits for Dead Space. This was never a series about exploring the wonders of the universe or of space as a wild frontier where the worst evil we can imagine is corporate greed dominating the stars. No, this is a game about how space is downright scary; an abyss into which we gaze and see our nightmares reflected right back. Hard to marvel at the universe with a Necromorph's blades in your gut.Necromorph is a fancy space word for zombie by the way. You'll come to know them intimately in Dead Space, as they jumpscare you every few minutes for the next ten or so hours. If there's one thing I'm glad the remake didn't change, it's the Necromorph jumping-out-of-vent scream that almost sounds as if they're as surprised as you are. It really is good to be back on the Ishimura, even if this is a remake instead of a fourth game.\u00a0It's a fact made all the more frustrating by how much this remake feels like a brand new Dead Space. Sure, it's got the same bleak atmosphere, overarching narrative, and the same ol' Necromorphs, but it could be the foundation for Dead Space moving forward; proof that this survival horror formula is still as strong now as it was when the original launched in 2008. And I think a big part of this remake's strength is down to the fact that it builds on what was already there rather than trying to make something brand new, much like that Necromorph stabbing you.Isaac Clarke is your average space engineer, hoping to see his girlfriend Nicole after a long time spent apart. Instead, he finds himself working the worst shift in human history. As you bounce from crisis-to-crisis trying to keep the dying planet-cracker, USG Ishimura, on its last legs, you also have to contend with the ship's changed crew, now shrieking Necromorphs of all shapes and sizes who very much want to make friends. Your only defence? An array of sci-fi power tools that turn out to be pretty effective at dismembering angry aliens.Dead Space manages more in ten hours than most games do in 30, and that narrative has been further focused in the remake. Isaac actually talks now and, though I did enjoy his silent yet capable Gordon Freeman-esque characterisation in the original, this helps make him feel like an active participant in the story. His dialogue does err a little towards action hero at times with lines like \"I'm all out of good ideas, so guess what's left\", but you do get more of a sense of him barely keeping his shit together as the crisis continues to escalate. It's one of the reasons I've always loved Isaac muttering curses as he stomps a Necromorph into oblivion\u2014you can hear him starting to crack.There are only so many limbs you can slice off, after all, even if the remake's weaponry does feel very good. There was a lot of talk about the new horrendous-sounding \"Necromorph peeling\" system in advance of the remake, but besides being a strong visual indicator of weakened limbs and what to chop, blowing more bits off Necromorphs is definitely a good time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08f92716-8de3-4df9-9f3c-4c1ff832e5e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "08f92716-8de3-4df9-9f3c-4c1ff832e5e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "215e9e18-f55d-45f1-81bc-676ce29d0a8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "adad768b8ca77caafdae1d4e408056733ba246e808e9c13d85eb4454cb1f1bf1"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a2c814f-9913-47b7-9434-008ab05b5c12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c2a5be983a8249ab9f4cde1c2f5a29172819cfd3b59d358962c39ea1578e85b"}}, "hash": "29c8534dbb43007ebac6383b056d7bc90f79fae0dbda096c0413c67bbc889dd8", "text": "My favourite thing has been blasting them point blank with the Force Gun and watching as an all-but-fleshless skeleton stands up like a chicken carcass put through one of those industrial blow dryers.The Leviathan boss fights are infinitely more fun now Dead Space 2 and 3's free floating zero-G has been added.Brutalising Necromorphs is an iconic part of Dead Space's cycle of catharsis: you jump scare me, I reverse-engineer you from existence, and this is how we cope with fear. Along with the great guns, there are also new alt-fire and upgrade options for weapons. The weird bullet cyclone for Pulse Rifle has been swapped for a proximity grenade launcher, and the Line Gun can lay down tripwires. For a Plasma Cutter purist like me, it's nice to be able to place a perimeter of traps and get a bit more use out of some of the other guns.Most of the big ticket boss fights, such as tangling with the Necromorph Hunter in chapter five, play out frame-for-frame\u2014though they definitely look a hell of a lot better. That said, both of the Leviathan boss fights are infinitely more fun now Dead Space 2 and 3's free floating zero-G has been added. The second boss fight in-particular has been entirely redesigned, with you gliding around the hulking mass and manually commandeering ADS cannons to blast away at its weak points.Dead Space's zero-G isn't just for tackling hulking space monstrosities, though. Another change is the inclusion of new no-gravity puzzles, and there's nothing quite like sitting back and floating as you try to figure out some complex space engineering problem. I say 'complex' even though it's usually just grabbing junk with kinesis. I've always found these sequences to be a nice respite from fighting Necromorphs, letting you think about something other than alien amputation for a little while, and they're a strong addition to the remake. Fixing the Comms Array in-particular is a very chill puzzle that lets you glide around in the middle of a big dome, swapping out parts, and repositioning to admire your work. There are even some open zero-G sections akin to the ship graveyard in Dead Space 3 that you can explore at will.It's just one of the many changes that works to enhance the original. Circuit Breakers are another wonderful example. These power-switchers have been added to older sections as a form of devil's bargain, letting you choose what to turn on and off. You want elevator access? Sure, but it'll cost you either lights or oxygen. It's a pick-your-poison mechanic that lets players select their preferred difficulty modifier and fight through the area. One of my favourite Circuit Breakers in Hydroponics is purely psychological, letting you turn off 'Jungle Ambience' so you can hear the entity living in the vents.Even a little expedition to open a locked room can be a dangerous proposition.While there used to be few reasons to return to older areas of the Ishimura, the remake adds locked Security Clearance doors and containers to motivate you to explore fully for extra items. Since you gain clearance as you progress the story, you have to remember the location of these secret stashes, Metroidvania-style, and return once you've got the upgrades. Coupled with the new random encounters and visual and audio cues, it goes a long way to making previous areas feel a bit more occupied. Even a little expedition to open a locked room can be a dangerous proposition depending on your luck.This Dead Space remake could also be termed a narrative one, since while it doesn't change the major story beats or plot of the original it does cast them in a completely new light via side quests, holographics logs, new characters, and through Isaac being able to speak this time. People like Elizabeth Cross, who you never interacted with directly, are now fully-fledged characters who have their own individual plotlines. The side quests also offer Nicole's perspective on what was happening onboard the Ishimura, and give you more insight into the cruelties of main antagonist, Dr. Mercer, who's now a more fully-developed character.\u00a0Motive's done a great job in judiciously adding layers to the original story, focusing on existing but underdeveloped elements, and just generally giving players more insight into the Ishimura and its conflicts prior to Isaac's arrival. It makes the first Dead Space fit far better with the other games from a lore and continuity perspective, but it's the execution that really lands, with no oversteps or overly significant changes. Subsequent playthroughs even provide extra audio logs and Easter eggs, some of which inform the reveals from the original ending.Yet the overall effect is weirdly frustrating.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a2c814f-9913-47b7-9434-008ab05b5c12": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a2c814f-9913-47b7-9434-008ab05b5c12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "08f92716-8de3-4df9-9f3c-4c1ff832e5e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "29c8534dbb43007ebac6383b056d7bc90f79fae0dbda096c0413c67bbc889dd8"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f6b6678-31bc-4f49-b402-3663614389a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "19be08fd5745063d8c471d8db7c96982e3fddd04512a17e7a7a5996afc8aa937"}}, "hash": "4c2a5be983a8249ab9f4cde1c2f5a29172819cfd3b59d358962c39ea1578e85b", "text": "On one level it's amazing that so much effort has gone into re-developing the original game's plotline: But at the same time, this effort could've been equally well applied to a new Dead Space. It's hard not to feel the same way about the improved sound design and visuals. The remake was built from the ground-up using the Frostbite engine, and looks and sounds incredible. All of which mainly makes me want to play a new non-remade Dead Space game in 2023 with this production quality. Another aspect of the frustration is that another game might've had space to push some of the remake's new ideas and mechanics further.But it also speaks to how strong this remake is that my primary complaint is wishing the care and effort went into a sequel. This game could have gone further in terms of adding replayability for older areas since, beyond weapon upgrades, you don't really need credits or ammo from Security Clearance stashes beyond a certain point. The side quests mostly run parallel to the main story, too, so while they add a nice complementary layer, they don't provide much extra playtime.It took me around 12 hours to complete everything on medium difficulty, but the remake also features new game plus with harder 'phantom enemies' and twelve hidden Marker Fragments that unlock an alternate ending if found. So even though it's a little on the shorter side, this is what Dead Space has always been: an intense, momentum-driven experience. Most of all, I'm just happy Dead Space is back and Dead Space is good. Even if this doesn't lead to a new game, I'll keep my limbs crossed for an equally strong remake of the second in the future.The Dead Space remake sets a new standard for the future of the survival horror series\u2060, even if it isn't the sequel I've been pining for.Sean's first PC games were Full Throttle and Total Annihilation and his taste has stayed much the same since.

During its long career as a \"planet cracker\", this unpleasant hybrid of Nostromo and whaling vessel has been modded and expanded in grander and smaller ways. Even playing a newcomer - part of a small team sent to repair the Ishimura following a loss of comms - you feel that history of alterations as you stomp from sector to sector, fixing up broken systems while demolishing the, as it transpires, horribly mutated undead remnants of the crew.\r\n\r\nEach section is an architectural battle between elementary worker needs such as guardrails and the requirements of enormous machines, with the argument typically falling in the machines' favour. The age and quality of the fittings also reflects a corporate class divide: the bridge is a gleaming concert stage with fancy free-standing glass displays, while the mining and maintenance decks are a warren of rust and asteroid debris, with huge turbines roaring away inches overhead. It often feels like more thought has been given to the placing of snack vending machines than life-saving fixtures like O2 dispensers. The aforesaid zombies or \"Necromorphs\" have set their own stamp on the d\u00e9cor, filling whole decks with carpets of grumpy biomatter, and turning every human-sized vent into an object of menace.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f6b6678-31bc-4f49-b402-3663614389a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f6b6678-31bc-4f49-b402-3663614389a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a2c814f-9913-47b7-9434-008ab05b5c12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c2a5be983a8249ab9f4cde1c2f5a29172819cfd3b59d358962c39ea1578e85b"}, "3": {"node_id": "448cc075-7172-4a8a-a353-d165850f2d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "35c00b8adafd8cc5d7f3affb092f59e4369d4be2c760e313cec9fd714685d24f"}}, "hash": "19be08fd5745063d8c471d8db7c96982e3fddd04512a17e7a7a5996afc8aa937", "text": "It's not a great place to call home, even if you're an officer, but it's an engrossing play environment - give or take its clownish lore graffiti, anyway. Revisiting the 2008 game last year in anticipation of this year's meticulous but in key respects, disappointing remaster, I was struck by how Dead Space layers up your understanding of the Ishimura by shuttling you back and forth, entering layouts from different angles with different objectives. Admittedly, the fact that literally every mechanism you need to survive has to be fixed grows absurd towards the finish. But the payoff is that the environment feels persistent and alive in a way, say, the prison of spiritual sequel The Callisto Protocol never did for me. Dead Space is celebrated for its devoted yet distinctive spin on Giger - from the outside, the orbiting Ishimura looks like an enormous facehugger drifting above a ruptured egg - but it's the way the game keeps you moving around and reappraising the setting that makes it such an evocative haunted house.\r\n\r\nPart of the remaster's intrigue is comparing the Ishimura's in-world history of modification to the developer's own renovations, which broadly aim to recuperate what was once an experimental (by EA's standards) one-off into the larger storyline and franchise Dead Space would spawn. There's the base visual overhaul, which adds details, depths and, indeed, guts to the game's already busy contours. Much as the Necromorphs now consist of layers of tissue that slough away under fire, so hitherto flat walls now teem with sunken, baroque flourishes. The poisoned air has additional texture, shaping the light in nasty, unquantifiable ways, while sound travels differently depending on the intervening objects and materials. But the changes aren't just about ambience.\r\n\r\nThere are new rooms tucked in amongst the old layouts - add-on chambers for a handful of side missions that deepen the fates of certain characters, including Dr Mercer and his awful Hunter. Some areas and their tasks have been totally transformed: the original game's mounted-gun asteroid blasting sequence now sees you zipping around in zero-G (the remaster borrows Dead Space 2's more user-friendly jetpack), synching the ship's cannons to your weapons while boulders rain down on the hull. The annoying boss battles are back, yellow-painted weakpoints and all, but there's a sprinkling of worthwhile new puzzle variables, such as circuit-breaker panels which invite you to choose between, say, switching off the oxygen or the lights in order to power another system.\r\n\r\nSome rooms or storage containers now require you to have a certain security level, which increases at story-triggered intervals - an incentive to revisit cleared areas using the redesigned tram system, which is no longer a chapter-ending device but more of a level-select hub, with main and side objectives flagged on the tube map. I found this irritating at first - the last thing I want in a remake is additional, gated looting for the sake of it. But both the security level promotions and the new side missions actually fit the game's back-and-forth campaign structure, ensuring that you'll always have something to investigate and unlock when you loop back through an area. Only a handful ask you to go off-piste, and the farther-flung optional chambers house new, nice-to-have mods for the game's modestly redesigned arsenal - a combo amplifier for your Plasma Cutter, or an extra ricochet for the sawblade-launching Ripper.\r\n\r\nIt all adds up to a comprehensive, if not essential-feeling rework of a cherished setting and playspace - nowhere near as ambitious as the Final Fantasy 7 remake's Midgar, but a step beyond a cosmetic touch-up. Where this year's remake loses me a bit is in its handling of Clarke and the backstory writing. One of the most significant additions is also a removal: giving Isaac Clarke a voice means taking away his voicelessness. No, I'm not trying to wind you up with semantics. Clarke's wordlessness in the 2008 game isn't simply a lack, waiting to be rectified 15 years later. It's fundamental to the horror and your understanding of the protagonist. Doing away with it produces a different, and perhaps, more comfortable experience.\r\n\r\nTo start with, Clarke not having a voice meant that you paid more attention to his wonderfully animated and expressive body - my favourite Dead Space feature after the game's legendary holographic UI design. It's all in the way his weight shifts when he strafes, the wobble of his shoulders when his health runs low, the relatable tilt of his head as he peers up desperately at yet another screenful of warning messages.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "448cc075-7172-4a8a-a353-d165850f2d5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "448cc075-7172-4a8a-a353-d165850f2d5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f6b6678-31bc-4f49-b402-3663614389a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "19be08fd5745063d8c471d8db7c96982e3fddd04512a17e7a7a5996afc8aa937"}, "3": {"node_id": "f1c5040e-1427-48a7-b218-28916eaf2470", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e59408ec2b90b7dd7d27210f4766d01ef565e8262cbbc4663c95abea041cbe5"}}, "hash": "35c00b8adafd8cc5d7f3affb092f59e4369d4be2c760e313cec9fd714685d24f", "text": "The remake softens this: Clarke's injury fatigue is less visible, the animations less demonstrative. Instead, you pick up on his state via the new context-sensitive audio design, with different voice performances to reflect pain and shortness of breath.\r\n\r\nClarke's wordlessness made me feel more protective of him, back in the day, like I was guiding a shy child through a labyrinth. But it also, of course, makes him strange, his thoughts on the situation inaccessible, his very reality as a person in question next to the speaking members of the cast. Mute protagonists are often styled \"blank tablets\" for the player to project onto. 2008-era Clarke is more like a scuffed mirror. His motions follow yours, but there's something else in the reflection that eludes discovery. Having to perceive him primarily as a body also emphasises the body horror elements of his vacuum suit - beaten-down and contorted where, say, Master Chief's Mjolnir armour cuts and captures the light, with metal bands that look like flayed bones, a vulnerable glowing spine and a splintered visor suggestive of a man peering through the bars of a cell.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying I've ever felt genuinely afraid of Clarke, but so much of the character's old charm is that element of uncertainty. For a man whose back is a literal health gauge, he is thrillingly ambiguous. The remake sacrifices this in order to make Clarke fit the more naturalistic voiced character he becomes in later games. He's an active participant in expanded, reshot dialogue scenes, joining in speculation about the origins of the Necro outbreak, offering his expertise rather than waiting for instructions, bonding with other characters like the botanist Elizabeth Cross, helping to flesh out their histories even as they flesh out his. He cracks the occasional joke. He still shuts up for long intervals when there's nobody on comms, mind you. He doesn't talk over environmental cues, or fill the void with gameplay hints masquerading as quippy notes-to-self. But he's a character rather than a stranger, and the story's obvious hero - the middle line between the bull-headedness of your mission commander Hammond and the back-biting of Daniels, your computer specialist.\r\n\r\nAll this absolutely has its advantages. In particular, developing Isaac as a voiced part also means developing the character of Nicole Brennan, his missing girlfriend and the Ishimura's medical officer. While she's still basically a damsel in distress, the remaster's side missions introduce a found-document backstory, both giving Brennan more agency as a character and digging into the reasons she and Clarke begin the game solar systems apart. But it all comes at the cost of eeriness - and moreover, it overlooks the other way of framing Clarke's original lack of a speaking role, which is that the events of Dead Space are sort of above his pay grade.\r\n\r\nHe's the greaser sent downstairs to fix the plumbing while the officers and top geeks discuss the plot. He isn't a practised soldier or leader, like Hammond - he doesn't even have a weapon, when you first set foot on the Ishimura - nor is his 2008 incarnation gifted with special insight on Dead Space's wider power struggle between governments, corporations and Scientology-esque cults. He's just a guy who's very good at taking things apart and putting them back together, and it turns out this is exactly what the situation demands.\r\n\r\nThe trick to fighting Necromorphs - which come in a range of excitable manifestations, from guillotine-armed skirmishers to pouncing leopardlikes and dart-throwing zombie infants - is that they can't generally be overwhelmed with sheer firepower. Instead, they must be disassembled, preferably after being dolloped in Stasis energy, so you can take your time aiming. The game admittedly departs from this idea a bit as the plot unfolds, with scavenged tools like the flamethrower and Force Gun allowing you to firewall mobs and shatter ambushers without much science, but dismemberment remains the guiding principle, not least because it's economical: ripped-off Necro limbs can be hurled with telekinesis in place of ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe remaster leaves all this essentially the same, save for a touch of re-tuning: the Contact Beam, for example, now has a continuous fire that makes it more practical against rank-and-file undead. It also keeps to the old rhythm of ambushes and enemy grand-standing, with Necros sometimes bursting through vents behind you and sometimes lurching around distant corners to waggle their joints whimsically while you absent-mindedly Force-lift a can of explosive fuel.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1c5040e-1427-48a7-b218-28916eaf2470": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1c5040e-1427-48a7-b218-28916eaf2470", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "448cc075-7172-4a8a-a353-d165850f2d5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "35c00b8adafd8cc5d7f3affb092f59e4369d4be2c760e313cec9fd714685d24f"}, "3": {"node_id": "acb4713d-96b3-4f39-b605-dd9d7e9b2c63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e050e782e9823ff66a928a8347e9964d1af254d787c7e688d9fdecf6b1334237"}}, "hash": "6e59408ec2b90b7dd7d27210f4766d01ef565e8262cbbc4663c95abea041cbe5", "text": "Sometimes you're cool and precise, delimbing a Necro in the minimum possible moves while advancing to distance yourself from the second attacker you know is coming up behind you - all in a day's work. Sometimes, it's the kitchen fight from Dog Soldiers: flailing indiscriminately at walls of teeth and claws, stamping frenziedly on de-legged opponents, and wasting precious ammo on ragdoll animations misread as attacks.\r\n\r\nAll this ties back to the old Clarke's lack of a speaking role. His primary means of characterising himself wasn't through killing but these acts of violent, but careful re-engineering - a succinct articulation of his place in the world and the role he plays with regard to its various sprawling schemes and sinister machinations, human and otherwise. In particular, the emphasis on dismantling, rather than merely destroying opponents is a rebuke to the claims made by other characters that the Necros are a means of spiritual rebirth, transcending the constraints of individual human bodies. Each Necro you slay is a microcosmic shattering of those delusions: no, these are not angels of the rapture. They are arms and legs and torsos and heads. If they appear otherwise, that is because they have been incorrectly put together. It falls to Clarke to reduce these creatures to the sum of their squirming parts.\r\n\r\nAgain, shifting Clarke's characterisation to dialogue can't help but spoil this, whatever the competency of the dialogue writing and Gunner Wright's sturdy voice performance. The character's actions no longer speak louder than words, and I think that's symptomatic of the Dead Space remake as a whole. While this is a meticulous and appreciative reworking, a little too much of it seems designed to get in the original's way, to blur its focus and mutate it into an appendage of the omnivorous franchise operation it would become, where everything needs to be written into an on-going narrative backdrop, and genuine ambiguity is minimised. Rather than rescuing the past, it represents a franchise reaching its tendrils backward through time to become its own progenitor. The results can be compelling, but make sure you play the 2008 game first.\r\n\r\n\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nEdwin Evans-Thirlwell\n\n          Contributor\n        Edwin is a writer from London hailed by peers as \"terminally middle-class\" and \"experienced\".

I ease my way down the dimly-lit corridors of the USG Ishimura space vessel with care, hugging the aluminum walls like a drunk after a day in the pub. I peer round corners like a child playing hide and seek, and then move slowly, pivoting back and forth as I go, as if trying to lose my shadow. I walk, not because I'm a tough guy, but because I'm fucking terrified. One step. Pivot. Two steps. Pivot. I hear a crashing sound from somewhere in the distance. A muted explosion, the screech of metal being sheared with force, then a bang and I'm plunged into darkness. And that's when I run. \u00a0\u00a0Release date: January 27, 2023\nPlatform(s): PS5, Xbox Series X, PC\nDeveloper: Motive Studio\nPublisher: EAI run because I've learned that my life depends on it. The Dead Space remake has taught me that, just like its source material, the hostile necromorphs that've forcefully taken over the ship I'm now stranded on will tear me limb from limb in a moment's notice. And so I dash into a corner where I can't be flanked by the hideous natives. I raise my military-grade Pulse Rifle in anticipation, while my index finger hovers over the R1 and R2 buttons of my DualSense control pad \u2013 the choice between unloading primary fire or a proximity mine is one I'll make in the heat of the moment. I hold my breath, steady my hand, and\u2026 And nothing. The ship's power source hums to life, the lights flicker on, and it's back to business.Don't get me wrong: Motive Studio's Dead Space remake absolutely shines in its gun-toting, alien-blasting blockbuster showdowns. But the ways in which it toys with your mind, keeps you on edge, and masterfully recalls the 2008 original while delivering something entirely fresh is pretty incredible. We rightly hail horror games elsewhere for their ability to scare us with what we cannot see \u2013 design choices often accentuated by a steady flow of high and low-tension moments. Dead Space, on the other hand, filled me with dread from start to finish. And it takes a pretty special game to pull that off. Especially one that I was sure I was familiar with already.The survival horror genre has been well-served for modern day remakes in recent years, kick-started by Resident Evil 2 in 2019. Capcom's reimagining set a high bar, reworking just about every aspect of its 21-year-old source material to create an entirely different beast to the one that first graced the PSOne. With Dead Space, however, Motive Studios has faced a different challenge \u2013 simply because the technical jump from PS3 and Xbox 360, while notable, isn't quite as big. Even approaching 15 years old, Dead Space still looks good today. Its over-the-shoulder view point is still popular, especially in the survival horror space, and, mechanically, the multi-checklist mission structure of the first game is still present in many games in 2023.\u00a0Making this point is important to dispel any notion, then, that the Dead Space remake is simply the same game with a modern makeover.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2f957c6b-6919-4531-b22e-3eacf89a53b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2f957c6b-6919-4531-b22e-3eacf89a53b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "acb4713d-96b3-4f39-b605-dd9d7e9b2c63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e050e782e9823ff66a928a8347e9964d1af254d787c7e688d9fdecf6b1334237"}, "3": {"node_id": "b193c2a6-ddcd-40f4-8397-78b52d6905c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "334528a4dd62857feee77236b5ad56f6c106d2244c2db87e7fb190cf83758a57"}}, "hash": "6e9aece20c857f76aa561731ed67f7a35d4c81fc5260495ecdd749f2455de439", "text": "Sure, today's Dead Space looks brilliant, oozing atmosphere and painting a more credible version of the ill-fated USG Ishimura \u2013 but that's because it's been rebuilt from the ground up in the Frostbite engine, with lighting, textures, character animations and enemy move patterns all dialed up and brought in-line with PS5 and Xbox Series X standards. The game follows the same narrative arc as the original, but it interweaves new story offshoots and more sophisticated dialogue throughout; while also replacing the once-silent protagonist Issac Clarke with voice acting from Gunner Wright, who brought the character to life in Dead Space 2 and 3.\u00a0Out on the field, enemy placement has been drastically altered, as have the transitions between some levels and the bosses which gate them. Without spoiling too much here, there is one end-of-chapter enemy who's been entirely reworked to great, sanity-saving effect; which in turn totally transforms the build-up to and aftermath of the encounter. Elsewhere, environmental puzzles have been completely overhauled in places \u2013 including a new take on Zero G sections, where players can now fly freely around internal and external locations powered by a booster \u2013 posing new challenges that left me scratching my head on more than one occasion. Through all of this, Dead Space has been granted new levels of depth \u2013 to the point where I'd argue being in any way familiar with the original is as much a hurdle to be overcome as the game's tangible obstacles themselves.Take me in the above scenario, slouching down a hallway I'd already cleared of several foes previously, doubling back on myself to reach a tram station. The original Dead Space pulled very few punches to this end \u2013 explosions and power cuts invariably preceded trouble \u2013 but toying with your nervous disposition in these moments works on two core levels. Firstly, it makes backtracking more exciting. The USG Ishimura is an expertly interlinked playground, but, like the first game, you'll do a lot of shuttling around the same claustrophobic locations as you progress the story. Being unsure of what might lie around corners you've already uncovered is a sure-fire way of keeping things fresh, and it works. Secondly, by making it seem like trouble's coming, but not actually executing the threat, the game messes with your head. It invites you to doubt yourself, your skills, your nerve, while simultaneously allowing the devs to vault the fourth wall with a nod and a wink, as if to say: \"nice try, think again.\"\u00a0A new 'Intensity Director' powers much of these variable outcomes, said to be capable of 1,200 unique events that appear to occur at random. Similar to the aforementioned power cut, incidental screams or unseen surviving crew members sobbing plague many-a-journey from A to B, which, combined with Dead Space's penchant for break-neck, blood-boiling battles against scores of angry necromorphs at any given time helps maintain its sense of omnipresent alarm. Add all of this to the game's more subtle tweaks, such as essential stasis stations appearing on different walls during boss fights, firearms operating slightly different from their OG counterparts, and certain level layouts now being unrecognizable, and Dead Space will keep you glued to the edge of your seat for the duration.Sure, there are still some post-BioShock era set-pieces left in \u2013 getting our first glimpse of a new enemy type decimating an NPC on the opposite side of safety glass is no longer scary whatsoever \u2013 but these moments, I reckon, exist as a homage to the original's place in time.Under the hood, the Dead Space remake comes with a suite of accessibility options missing from the original game that cover everything from 'Color Blind Mode' to aim assistance, a 'Story' difficulty setting (that sees Isaac's health continuously regenerate), HUD options, subtitle options, and graphic content warnings that allow players to hide the game's more disturbing or more graphic scenes.\u00a0The Dead Space remake also follows the likes of GTA 5's PS5 iteration by offering console players the choice of a 'Quality' or a 'Performance' mode. In essence, the former portrays the game at its best-looking, in 4K UHD resolution with ray-tracing, but with a 30fps capped framerate. The latter, on the other hand, maintains a steady 60fps framerate, but with 2K QHD resolution and no ray-tracing. How you play is up to you, of course, but I will say that if you can overlook the negligible difference between 30fps and 60fps, Dead Space looks gorgeous running on Quality mode.\u00a0Again, it feels like we're well-served for horror game remakes at the moment, but Motive Studio's Dead Space is a horror remake done right.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b193c2a6-ddcd-40f4-8397-78b52d6905c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b193c2a6-ddcd-40f4-8397-78b52d6905c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f957c6b-6919-4531-b22e-3eacf89a53b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e9aece20c857f76aa561731ed67f7a35d4c81fc5260495ecdd749f2455de439"}, "3": {"node_id": "fc2e2387-8e6d-4e03-a7da-854819e3f3e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f2e64b415c2c050b2d4479be65664f0cf5e045679dbfd38d9ff69bc68dc4410"}}, "hash": "334528a4dd62857feee77236b5ad56f6c106d2244c2db87e7fb190cf83758a57", "text": "It really is a sublime mix of fresh and familiar, and it's freaking terrifying in its loud and quieter moments.

The current one does seem especially significant though, with multiple companies putting out relatively large budget horror games, despite the fact that the genre has never produced any big sellers. Things didn\u2019t get off to a good start with The Callisto Protocol, but perhaps this remake of 2008\u2019s Dead Space will fare differently.As welcome as it is, to see so many new Silent Hill games planned, the fact is the series has never sold that well and neither have most of its peers \u2013 even Resident Evil sells less than you\u2019d imagine, for such a well known franchise. Although the fact that the Resident Evil 2 remake sold over 10 million copies seems to have been the catalyst for this current resurgence of interest in the genre.For its part, the original Dead Space only sold around 1 million copies and was considered a financial disappointment by EA. To their credit, they gave it several more chances, in terms of sequels and spin-offs, and while they\u2019re blamed for the co-op focused Dead Space 3 it was clear by that point that the franchise was never going to be a big hitter in its then current form. The first two games did garner a cult fanbase though and they, at least, should be well pleased with this remake.The plot of Dead Space is not a complex one, as you and a small crew of engineers arrive at a giant mining spaceship that has gone radio silent. You quickly discover that the crew have all been turned into grotesque creatures referred to as necromorphs, egged on by a group of human cultists. The story\u2019s fine for what it is, although Dead Space has always been one of the most prominent examples of the trope where every mission objective involves being told to go somewhere dangerous and fix a piece of machinery.The plot and characters are not memorable but that doesn\u2019t really matter as the game has never been shy about the fact that it\u2019s a grab bag of ideas, visuals, and gameplay from multiple sources, from games like Resident Evil and System Shock to movies such as Alien, The Thing, and Event Horizon.Dead Space may be an original IP but originality is not its strong suit, which is the main reason why its status as a survival horror classic is disputed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc2e2387-8e6d-4e03-a7da-854819e3f3e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc2e2387-8e6d-4e03-a7da-854819e3f3e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "b193c2a6-ddcd-40f4-8397-78b52d6905c1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "334528a4dd62857feee77236b5ad56f6c106d2244c2db87e7fb190cf83758a57"}, "3": {"node_id": "e8732e78-7cf8-440f-afdd-358ef53d61ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e77b6cdd3cf764cc4a483e207fc7cd905b95bf90933d5f02fc2d199bee0ce63"}}, "hash": "3f2e64b415c2c050b2d4479be65664f0cf5e045679dbfd38d9ff69bc68dc4410", "text": "EA would clearly like you to think it\u2019s deserved but for others, including us, it\u2019s too generic and too lacking in new ideas to really qualify \u2013 even if it is very competently made.This only adds to the inherent difficulties of critiquing a remake, since there are always two, often incompatible, goals: trying to appeal to fans of the first game, most of which want it to be as close as possible to the original, and the need to create a high quality, modern game that stands on its own two feet.On that first point the Dead Space remake is a major success. The graphics aren\u2019t as good as Resident Evil 2, and the more distant camera angle less immersive, but in terms of recreating the look and feel of the original Xbox 360 game this is spot on. More impressively still, it actually adds quite a bit of extra content, not only including a voice for the previously mute main character but several new areas and gameplay mechanics.The most obvious evidence that this is based on a much older game is the small size of the rooms that make up the game\u2019s map. The remake makes it so that there\u2019s no loading needed to get between them, and the whole game is a God Of War style one shot, but there\u2019s no way a modern title would be made with such small scale areas, even as developer Motive Studio does their best to give them more depth and verticality.The predominately brown colour palette is also amusingly typical of the era but that couldn\u2019t be changed without completely changing the atmosphere. That said, we have always felt the necromorph enemies, that act like fast moving space zombies, were rather dull designs, and they\u2019re not any more visually interesting with next gen graphics.This is especially true as there can be some noticeable clipping issues with their gangly limbs and the considerable amount of gibbage left over from their defeated carcases (the main gimmick for the combat is that the easiest way to kill the necromorphs is to shoot off their limbs). This isn\u2019t helped by some very basic artificial intelligence, which even in more orchestrated set pieces just has them running straight at you.Released three years after Resident Evil 4, it is very obvious where Dead Space got the lion\u2019s share of its inspiration from. Especially since, at the time, original developer Visceral Games was very keen to emphasis that in their game you can walk and shoot at the same time. Even so, this is much less of a straight action game compared to Resident Evil 4 and, as you\u2019d expect, it has none of that game\u2019s charm or humour. Indeed, Dead Space is purposefully grim in a way that can feel tiringly one note.Despite a lot of jump scares, and some gory visuals, it\u2019s also not particularly scary, although that\u2019s not the damning criticism it might sound like. Dead Space may not leave you too frightened to look at the screen, but it is very tense and atmospheric. We particularly like the new feature where you frequently have to switch power to different sub-systems, which ends up with you having to turn the lights off at inopportune moments or no longer being able to use a lift to get to a safe era.It\u2019s almost a fourth wall breaking decision, since you know something terrible is going to happen as soon as you commit, but you actually have the option to turn off more systems than you need to, if you want to vary the difficulty or hope that you\u2019ll uncover a secret area. There\u2019s also more backtracking than in the original, to make it feel more like a Metroidvania, with things like giant flesh tendrils now blocking your way from certain routes.There are other more minor changes, such as new alternative fire modes for guns and special abilities for the upgrade system, all of which fit in perfectly. If the remake is a financial success, and EA decide to commission a brand new sequel, the work they\u2019ve done here suggests that Motive are very much the right people for the job.There are other elements we\u2019re less happy with though, with the new approach to zero-G areas being rather disappointing. They\u2019re a welcome palette change but rather than you being pushed back by the recoil of your guns, or when hitting another objects, the physics is disappointingly simplified and feels like a missed opportunity to do something interesting with a more realistic space game.If you\u2019ve never played Dead Space before then you\u2019ll find this a tense and enjoyable experience, albeit one that seems to have been fashioned as a patchwork of other people\u2019s ideas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8732e78-7cf8-440f-afdd-358ef53d61ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8732e78-7cf8-440f-afdd-358ef53d61ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc2e2387-8e6d-4e03-a7da-854819e3f3e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f2e64b415c2c050b2d4479be65664f0cf5e045679dbfd38d9ff69bc68dc4410"}, "3": {"node_id": "7cbd3075-cdcf-4918-9bf5-08924b6ad8ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "80c389ca3c153c3e968f4b79e210b1191ff21c3d2b4187c20dab8314e5f83d93"}}, "hash": "1e77b6cdd3cf764cc4a483e207fc7cd905b95bf90933d5f02fc2d199bee0ce63", "text": "As you slowly tour the ship, fixing every piece of machinery in your way, the pacing and repetition do become an issue before the end, but overall this is a solid if not exceptional example of the genre.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationHowever, if you are an existing fan this seems close to the perfect remake. The graphics aren\u2019t as good as The Callisto Protocol but while that game, by one of the series\u2019 original creators, was meant to be a spiritual sequel to Dead Space it already feels like an evolutionary dead end.Resident Evil 2 transcended the position of most remakes by being more than just an exercise in nostalgia and instead showed a way forward for the whole franchise, while also keeping to its roots. The Dead Space remake is not quite so revelational but despite its obsession with death and dismemberment, this is clearly a franchise that is still very much alive.In Short: An excellent remake of a not-quite-classic survival horror, that nevertheless makes a convincing argument for the continuation of the series.Pros: A respectful remake that makes several changes to the original design without them ever seeing out of place. The core experience is tense and atmospheric, with an unusual combat focus.Cons: The original game always had problems in terms of pacing, repetition, and general unoriginality.

This renovation of the 2008 horror classic restores it beyond its original glory. The dismemberment-focused gunplay feels great, it looks even better, and while other noteworthy changes may not feel as substantial as some other remakes, they\u2019re welcomed expansions to the existing template. The result is a remake that faithfully recaptures the magic of its predecessor while amplifying the elements that made it beloved in the first place.\u00a0Dead Space's story centers on engineer Isaac Clarke joining a small team to answer a distress call from the USG Ishimura, a massive mining ship designed to \u201ccrack\u201d planets and siphon their precious minerals. An outbreak of vicious aliens called necromorphs has ravaged the Ishimura thanks to their ability to transform corpses into members of its ranks. In addition to stopping this extraterrestrial menace and untangling a conspiracy centering on a theistic cult, Clarke must also uncover the fate of his girlfriend, Nicole, a doctor stationed on the ship.The story from the original is largely intact, but with some key elements either remixed or expanded with greater context based on lore established later in the series. Outside of tightening continuity and adding welcomed background on side characters, these differences don\u2019t dramatically alter the story\u2019s flow or events. The exception is a surprising change to a memorable\u00a0moment later in the game \u2013 a rework that makes more sense in context to the point that I now prefer it over its original incarnation.\u00a0Another prominent narrative difference is that Isaac now talks, voiced by the same performer who brought him to life in the Dead Space sequels. As in those games, the plot benefits from Isaac feeling more like a real person instead of a silent errand boy. Plot twists and revelations hit harder now that he can believably react to them. Motive also did a good job weaving his new dialogue into the existing script, which remains unchanged in most instances. A few performances, though, namely Hammond\u2019s, fall flat in a way that feels preserved from the late 2000s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cbd3075-cdcf-4918-9bf5-08924b6ad8ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cbd3075-cdcf-4918-9bf5-08924b6ad8ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "e8732e78-7cf8-440f-afdd-358ef53d61ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e77b6cdd3cf764cc4a483e207fc7cd905b95bf90933d5f02fc2d199bee0ce63"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e05ac6a-9a71-47b3-bd63-950ed98a8a36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6a5d8543ef6b13d66b8e7079ca1f59cb27153df4b537f6c3093fe3c51c6b4a7"}}, "hash": "80c389ca3c153c3e968f4b79e210b1191ff21c3d2b4187c20dab8314e5f83d93", "text": "The improved presentation turns Dead Space, already a looker in its day, into a gory feast for the eyes. The Ishimura and its mutated inhabitants look great, and traversing the blood-stained corridors is even more harrowing thanks to the show-stealing lighting. Whether you\u2019re blanketed in pitch darkness with only your weapon\u2019s flashlight for illumination or basking in the eerily warm glow of planet Aegis VII orbiting outside a window, the lighting serves as the presentational glue that makes this graphical facelift work. The sound design also deserves a shout-out, offering a fair share of devious audio tricks and new hair-raising necromorph groans and screams.\u00a0Combat feels familiar, though the reworked controls are more in line with modern third-person games. For example, Issac can run by clicking the analog stick rather than a shoulder button. The trusty plasma cutter and other weapons pack a satisfying punch, especially if you\u2019re using the PlayStation 5\u2019s DualSense features. Dismembering limbs is more satisfying and strategic thanks to the new necromorph damage system, in which layers of skin, muscle, and bone fall apart. This system better showcases the damage and exposes weak points. For example, I loved engulfing enemies using the flamethrower, then pinpointing charred, exposed bones to slice apart with my cutter.\u00a0\u00a0The wide array of enemy types from the original return in full force, and they're still fun and often challenging to take apart. Using the time-slowing stasis to stop an attack before it connects or using kinesis to pick up and impale necromorphs with stray objects, including their own amputated sharpened limbs, feels as awesome now as it did 14 years ago. It helps that rooms pack more props and environmental weapons to fling around, such as gasoline and stasis tanks.Unless you finished the original game recently or replayed it enough to intimately know its map, the level design changes probably won\u2019t leap out as suddenly as a necromorph ambush. The Ishimura's many rooms and layout remain generally the same, but have been expanded. Most notably, you can access certain areas without riding the tram car. This change helps make the ship feel more organically connected. The tram still exists for those who want to quickly travel between sections necromorph-free. I was lukewarm on some of the zero gravity sections in the original, where you use the suits rockets to propel yourself through weightless, sometimes oxygen-free zones. I can still do without them here, but at least now, those sections adopt the improved control scheme of the sequels to make them feel less like disorienting headaches.\u00a0You can now freely revisit areas anytime, but do so at your own peril because necromorphs can still reappear in previously cleared zones. These attacks can be the most startling. Sometimes, I revisited an area, and nothing happened. Other times, I was assaulted in surprisingly new, thoughtfully constructed ways. I love how this system perpetuates Dead Space\u2019s tense and unpredictable design outside the main path, making me second-guess my surroundings no matter how many times I step into them.\u00a0The prize for revisiting areas is often money, weapon upgrade nodes, and precious ammo, all of which can be locked behind tiers of security doors. You\u2019ll also be making these trips to complete the newly added sidequests. There aren\u2019t many of these extra missions, but they generally serve to supplement the lore. One quest delves into the creation of the regenerating Hunter necromorph, for example. Though you\u2019ll largely only find yourself running around the ship\u2019s districts in search of specific audio logs or keys, sidequests add a small but tasty sidedish that extends your unfortunate visit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather than reinvent the wheel, Motive made Dead Space look nicer, play better, and preserved the core of the experience. Its new flourishes add to that enjoyment instead of subtracting. This remake respects and polishes up my memories of Isaac\u2019s first encounter with the necromorphs without making me miss the original version. It also acts as the perfect entry point for newcomers since it feels on par with today\u2019s titles. I hope this exceptional revision signals to EA that Dead Space has plenty of gas in the tank and becomes a harbinger for more horrifying stories in this universe.\u00a0\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

The original 2008 game is a modern classic that holds up exceedingly well by today's standards. There's very little that feels dated about its design, and the strategic dismemberment that forms the basis of its combat still offers a unique and gory thrill that's yet to be replicated. The remake's leap in graphical fidelity breathes new life into its stifling horror, but public discourse has centered on whether it really needs to exist in the first place. That might be a cynical viewpoint, but it's no less valid. And after reaching the end credits myself, I'm still not entirely convinced it needs to either, yet I'm extremely happy it does. Remaking Dead Space in 2023 may not feel especially necessary, but EA Motive has crafted a game that manages to improve upon its excellent progenitor in a variety of ways--even if only marginally so.These improvements begin with its story, which has been expanded via a number of alterations to both its characters and storytelling. The basic beats that make up the original game's narrative remain intact, starting with your fateful arrival on the USG Ishimura. After responding to a distress signal, you find the hulking planet cracker-class ship floating lifelessly above the planet of Aegis VII. Once on board, things take a familiar sharp turn downhill, but now once-silent protagonist Isaac Clarke has been given a voice to react appropriately. I'm generally not a fan of silent protagonists, although there's always a danger of vocal characters being overly chatty, especially in a horror game where atmosphere and tension are so delicate. Thankfully, that's not the case here, and Isaac's newfound agency makes him feel less like a simple tool to be ordered around. Actor Gunner Wright reprises the role after bringing Isaac to life in Dead Space's sequels, so there's a level of continuity here that's also reflected in other aspects of the remake's design.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Dead Space Remake Everything To KnowMuch of the script has been rewritten to accommodate Isaac's speech, and the tale it weaves is still engaging. The church of Unitology--a cultish religious sect that plays a significant role in the Dead Space universe--is much more prominent this time around, especially early on. Characters mention the infamous church in a way that feels natural, discussing the sect before they're aware of just how substantial its impact will be on future events. Kendra Daniels--one of Isaac's colleagues and your main point of contact throughout the game--has also been rewritten in a manner that elevates the remake. Previously she was prickly and leaned into some needlessly antagonistic behavior, but she's now been transformed into an empathetic character, which pays off down the line in a more effective way than before.Structurally, the vast majority of the remake is identical to the original game, from the hectic dash to the elevator that follows the initial reveal of the zombie-like Necromorphs, to the vital task of disabling all of the Wheezers that are poisoning the air on the Hydroponics Deck. There are a few small level design changes sprinkled throughout, however, along with some notable gameplay improvements. For starters, the zero gravity sequences now let you leap from the ground and use your suit's thrusters to freely move around each area, rather than rigidly hopping from one surface to another. Being able to essentially fly through these segments makes them much more interesting than they were before, as you're forced to deal with enemies that can attack from any angle while orienting yourself to solve various puzzles. Some of these sections, like the Ishimura's hanger, have also expanded in scope, deviating from the design of the ship's innards to give you a bit more freedom to explore.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec907e91-feee-410a-9575-8a14d174bf29": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec907e91-feee-410a-9575-8a14d174bf29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e05ac6a-9a71-47b3-bd63-950ed98a8a36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6a5d8543ef6b13d66b8e7079ca1f59cb27153df4b537f6c3093fe3c51c6b4a7"}, "3": {"node_id": "1b53647d-a373-4b18-8506-148af74a4ada", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "372289d41c07a33b1da4aa46784c81e988204a51a7d11e7b3ff97076670af0ba"}}, "hash": "d17ba5dd90ee8bfb0f23d841d3215cff2118e50becf7d6c253971db19eb07833", "text": "Others, like the ADS cannon repair job, have been completely redesigned to ramp up the tension, shifting from a stale turret shooting gallery to a treacherous spacewalk, and this carries over into your fights against The Leviathan as well.If you've played Dead Space 2 before, the freedom of movement in these redesigned zero-G segments will feel instantly familiar, and this is a consistent theme throughout this remake. The addition of special upgrades for each weapon in Isaac's arsenal of mining tools has also carried over from the 2011 sequel. You can attach a mod to the Plasma Cutter that causes its ammunition to set alight anything you shoot, dealing scalding burn damage over time, while another lets you use the Disc Ripper to ricochet sawblades that slice through multiple enemies. These mods are scattered throughout the Ishimura, so you're rewarded for searching every nook and cranny of the desolate mining vessel. A new security clearance system initially locks you out of certain rooms and lockers, though, but you'll gradually unlock higher clearance levels as you progress through the story.[EA Motive's Dead Space remake] improves upon the original with some smart new additions to almost every aspect of its design.This system feels like it was added in service of the inclusion of bespoke side quests, which task you with backtracking to previously explored areas of the ship. Having a reason to go back makes revisiting what were once locked doors feel organic--and the now-seamless travel between each part of the ship makes it feel like a genuine place--but the side quests themselves aren't particularly interesting from a gameplay perspective. Enemies occasionally crop up to provide an obstacle along familiar routes, but you can often backtrack in relative safety, and these quests essentially boil down to picking up an item or activating a previously recorded message. Attaining more background information on what happened aboard the Ishimura before everything went to hell is a narrative treat at least, particularly if you're invested in the series' lore, but it's a shame these side quests aren't more involved.Unlike the aforementioned upgrades, the primary fire modes for each weapon have largely remained the same as in the original game. However, a few of Isaac's repurposed firearms have entirely new secondary functions. The Pulse Rifle's alternate fire was formerly only really useful when completely surrounded by enemies, letting you hunker down to envelop yourself in a hail of bullets. This took a hefty toll on your ammunition and there were very few opportunities to use it without feeling like a waste. For the remake, Isaac's Pulse Rifle now comes equipped with a dual-purpose proximity mine that functions as either a trap or a makeshift grenade launcher. I found myself using this and the secondary fire modes on other weapons more often than I ever did in the original Dead Space, largely because they introduce an additional layer of strategy to each encounter with the ship's infestation of Necromorphs. The Flamethrower's new secondary fire mode is another good example, providing you with the option to shoot a wall of flame that can separate enemies by cordoning them off from one another with a fiery blaze.Out of all the revised weapons, however, it's the Force Gun that stands out amongst the crowd. Previously, this mid-game weapon was little more than a tool for pushing enemies away. Now, it's been redesigned to unleash a thunderous blast of energy that rips skin and muscle clean off the bone. It's a delightfully gruesome weapon that makes exquisite use of the remake's new peeling system, which looks just as gross as it sounds.The remake's overhauled visuals are phenomenal across the board, bringing the Ishimura's suffocatingly grim bowels to life with a disgusting sheen. It's an iconic location for a reason, and the visual upgrade and sheer attention to detail contribute to it feeling more lived in than ever. That\u2019s true whether it's the abandoned suitcases strewn across the arrival lounge, the cramped crew quarters and the glimpse they offer into the dreary existence of those working aboard the ship, or the posters for a product described as a \"carbonated hard bar\" providing the only semblance of color amongst its metal-carved hallways. The peeling system is one facet of the remake's improved graphical fidelity, and it has a delightful impact on each combat encounter. It ensures that skin, fat, and muscle layers are ripped off enemies with each successive wound, making the exposed bones vulnerable to snapping in half from a well-placed round or two. The green light running up the spine of Isaac's suit is a visual indicator of his health, and this makes the Necromorph's own bodies a reminder of theirs.Dead Space's combat still feels somewhat fresh because of the way it foregoes genre conventions where the headshot is king.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b53647d-a373-4b18-8506-148af74a4ada": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b53647d-a373-4b18-8506-148af74a4ada", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec907e91-feee-410a-9575-8a14d174bf29", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d17ba5dd90ee8bfb0f23d841d3215cff2118e50becf7d6c253971db19eb07833"}, "3": {"node_id": "27a7e004-23d5-4620-8b0b-4ccfc6ef9783", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c2141894e0ea80c506cb73e11a39cfa76f146d111375d642266e16851e64742"}}, "hash": "372289d41c07a33b1da4aa46784c81e988204a51a7d11e7b3ff97076670af0ba", "text": "Necromorphs can only be killed by slicing off their limbs, and it remains incredibly satisfying using weapons like the Plasma Cutter to lop them off at the legs before blasting away at their elongated arms as they desperately crawl toward you. The peeling system only enhances the experience, especially when using the Force Gun's secondary fire. This shoots out a gravity well that pulls enemies towards it, ripping their corpuscles off in the process. Like many of the weapon's secondary fire modes, this is rife for experimentation. You might set off a trap, using the gravity well to pull a bunch of enemies into one clump before burning them all with the flamethrower or using the Plasma Cutter to break through their now bare bones. For as great as the original Dead Space was, repetition did settle in during its final couple of hours, but the remake's added strategy and the variety of tools you're able to play around with prevent this from happening again.It's impossible to expect the Dead Space remake to be as transformative as something like the Resident Evil 2 remake was. The generational leap isn't as grand and so much about it feels inherently familiar to the 2008 original, such is the way EA Motive has weaved its changes into the Dead Space mold. The new side quests might leave a lot to be desired, but every other addition contributes to a remake that stays true to its progenitor while also improving upon it in a number of ways. Newcomers and hardcore Dead Space fans will get the most out of the experience, but this is now the quintessential way to play one of the survival horror genre's best.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:Made whole againIn the 15 years since Dead Space was released, it has cemented in my brain as a masterpiece of science-fiction horror. Its unmatched atmosphere, its visceral, lead-footed combat, and its cosmic terrors still hold up, through rose-tinted memories. The new Dead Space is faithful to those memories. Its world, the space-zombie-infested, planet-harvesting vessel named the USG Ishimura, is a cold, industrial maze lit by flickering halogen lamps, where every machine is broken down or on the verge of flying apart. Metal clangs, steam hisses, and morbid screams bounce through its hallways. The Ishimura is a terrifying, immersive graveyard of a ship.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.This remake brings the Ishimura back to life in visually stunning ways. Its decks, quarters, and airlocks have been rebuilt in painstaking detail. It is undoubtedly the star of developer Motive Studio\u2019s remake, a more believable and varied ship than the one seen in the original game. But it is just a part of Motive\u2019s re-engineering: Weapons, characters, and progression have all been rethought, resulting in the best possible version of Isaac Clarke\u2019s trek through a veritable hell \u2014 and hopefully the revival of a horror game franchise that flamed out too soon.The story of Dead Space, heavily inspired by sci-fi horror films Alien, Event Horizon, and Sunshine, is mostly unchanged. A small crew employed by the Concordance Extraction Corporation is sent to investigate why the Ishimura has gone dark, only to find it in great distress. The ship has been overtaken by terrifying creatures called Necromorphs, and the rescue team is promptly separated from one another. As engineer Isaac Clarke, you fight to survive the Necromorph infestation as you search for an escape \u2014 and for Dr. Nicole Brennan, Isaac\u2019s estranged romantic interest and the real reason he signed on for the Ishimura mission.Despite its general adherence to the original plot, Motive has updated major aspects of Dead Space\u2019s structure. For one, Isaac speaks. A silent protagonist in the original game, he now converses with his shipmates and the few survivors aboard the Ishimura. His more prominent role in dialogue, combined with updated text logs and audio recordings, makes for a more elegant story overall; it introduces the trilogy\u2019s theme of religious fanaticism, and the role of alien artifacts, much earlier, and in a less jarring fashion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27a7e004-23d5-4620-8b0b-4ccfc6ef9783": {"__data__": {"id_": "27a7e004-23d5-4620-8b0b-4ccfc6ef9783", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b53647d-a373-4b18-8506-148af74a4ada", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "372289d41c07a33b1da4aa46784c81e988204a51a7d11e7b3ff97076670af0ba"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4dc3516-afde-44a4-836e-a5478dccebae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "27eb5a86604109cbfec62909dc0219353d403df1e8275c7cc6c0e97b83adfa34"}}, "hash": "0c2141894e0ea80c506cb73e11a39cfa76f146d111375d642266e16851e64742", "text": "The impact of that alien technology on Isaac and his allies\u2019 psyche plays out in refreshing new ways, lending new weight to the characters\u2019 relationships and their inevitable deaths.Gunnar Wright, the voice of Isaac Clarke in the Dead Space sequels, returns to voice him here. His brand-new voiceover makes Isaac sound not like a put-upon errand boy, but a capable engineer unperturbed by shit going sideways every 15 minutes. The rest of the cast comprises new actors who bring solid performances: Brigitte Kali Canales in particular brings more nuance to computer specialist (and frequent task-giver) Kendra Daniels, and Faran Tahir (Iron Man, Star Trek) drips pure evil as Dr. Challus Mercer.Isaac plays much like he did in the original game: He\u2019s a systems engineer, not a hardened soldier, and he relies on what are ostensibly construction tools \u2014 laser cutters, sawblades, torches, and force fields designed for work in zero-gravity environments \u2014 to fight the Necromorphs. Dead Space\u2019s combat garnered acclaim for flipping video game conceits by prioritizing limb removal, not headshots or body shots, as the best way to fight enemies. Chop off an enemy\u2019s legs, and you\u2019ll slow it down. Amputate its arms and it has no way to fight. Slice off its head? That will only make it angrier. Far from feeling like a dated gimmick, limb removal is still grisly, satisfying, and tactical. If two or more Necromorphs are bearing down on you, what\u2019s your plan? Hit one with a movement-slowing stasis field, cripple the other so it has to crawl its way toward you, then shoot out a saw blade to slice \u2019em both up? That\u2019ll work. Or should you lay down a proximity mine and just lead them into a death trap? Like the original game, the remake demands constant reconsideration of your approach, with continual shifts in the Ishimura\u2019s environment and variations in Necromorph mobs.Isaac\u2019s everyman arsenal provides plenty of options, especially with new features that make each tool more useful. For example, the flamethrower, which serves Isaac well in more panicked moments, originally had an alternative-fire mode that launched an explosive fireball. In the remake, it instead builds a two-meter-wide wall of fire \u2014 anything that walks through it is burned to a crisp. The reliable rapid-fire pulse rifle also has a new alt-fire mode: a proximity mine that\u2019s instrumental when Necromorphs surround Isaac.Weapon upgrades like these are scattered throughout the game, both as collectible items and purchases from shop stations. Some are tucked away behind locked doors, and a new tiered security clearance system gives the Dead Space remake a more Metroid-like feel; there\u2019s some backtracking to be done through the Ishimura, and a sense of risk versus reward for doing so. Is it worthwhile to double back to a previously inaccessible area, when Necromorphs have a habit of bursting forth from hatches? Maybe!Motive has also retrofitted Dead Space with quality-of-life changes its sequels introduced. In the 2008 game, Isaac hopped from point to magnetized point in zero-gravity environments. However, he can now float and fly freely. Zero-G encounters have been summarily reworked, turning boss battles and minigame-like puzzles into tense, topsy-turvy situations. Appropriately, these spectacle-filled moments can be quite disorienting, even confusing, in keeping with the survival-horror uneasiness elsewhere.Motive\u2019s Dead Space remake also lives up to the impressive audio work of its source material. The sounds of the Ishimura are richly layered \u2014 the din of machinery and otherworldly screams are a constant amplifier of fear. There are also frequent audio feints and genuine shocks; I\u2019m not afraid to admit I was jump-scared a handful of times by the developer\u2019s tricks, despite being vigilant throughout.Beyond the audiovisual upgrades, Dead Space shows that its developer is acutely aware of its impact on modern games, particularly in the horror genre. The remake captures the soul of its subject in the vein of Capcom\u2019s Resident Evil remakes, delivering a meaty, memorable single-player horror game unmarred by tacked-on multiplayer or microtransactions. Dead Space is also replete with accessibility features, including multiple colorblind modes, input options, and even content warnings and an option to hide disturbing scenes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4dc3516-afde-44a4-836e-a5478dccebae": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4dc3516-afde-44a4-836e-a5478dccebae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "27a7e004-23d5-4620-8b0b-4ccfc6ef9783", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c2141894e0ea80c506cb73e11a39cfa76f146d111375d642266e16851e64742"}, "3": {"node_id": "a23aa52a-07d4-4097-bc14-1b4fb92a03cb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4aba22e587c377bf88d98fddbb7c08d213cfe4abd9694a46dce3ffb571c783e6"}}, "hash": "27eb5a86604109cbfec62909dc0219353d403df1e8275c7cc6c0e97b83adfa34", "text": "Yes, this is a game slathered in gore and visceral body horror, but moments of self-harm and extreme violence can be bypassed, if that is your preference.

The mining ship has always been the gray spinal cord to trigger-happy horror Dead Space, originally released in 2008 and made by the since-shuttered Visceral Games, and I\u2019ve gleaned as a newbie (I was 10 in 2008) that it\u2019s one of the best horror games of all time. But after I see the ship\u2014and the atrocities that populate it, indicated by graffiti (\u201cFuck this ship, it\u2019s a shitty capitalist organization,\u201d one on-the-nose scrawl says) and hallways sticky with organic goo\u2014I wonder if that\u2019s still the case.The USG Ishimura itself, at least, lives up to my expectations. As engineer Isaac Clarke, a formerly non-speaking character now imbued with Dead Space 2 and 3 actor Gunner Wright\u2019s cool voice of reason, I crash-land onto it along with my bickering crewmates, including Chief Security Officer Hammond and computer specialist Kendra Daniels. I\u2019m immediately impressed by the ship\u2019s engulfing shadows, the only extra dimension, really, to the lightless spine I spend around 16 hours running across and around. It\u2019s glued together by a speedy tram system, which was cut up by loading screens in the original game, but, in this Dead Space, travels smoothly without interruption. Though I often press my controller\u2019s right stick to prompt a glowing blue line to guide me to my next location, the tram system makes Ishimura\u2019s smallness obvious and more suffocating. This feeling doubles when I re-enter an area I was recently in, not thinking about the bodies I already wasted until noticing, there they are, still piled up. Those bodies, with their taut, twisted skin, lumpy intestines poking through\u2014like when you stick your thumb into an orange to break it open\u2014belong to Isaac\u2019s main opponent, the necromorphs.The remake adds rooms you can access with an added security clearance system (you earn Level 1, 2, and 3 clearance naturally as you progress through the game), which sustains exploration even after Ishimura\u2019s halls become familiar, and optional side quests for added context and background on characters. But, other than that, Dead Space 2023 doesn\u2019t build on Dead Space 2008\u2019s unconvincing story of crazed Unitologist cult members infecting people with their Red Marker in their quest for ascension, and so necromorphs continue to be yowling, sour victims of the Marker, and you need to hack their limbs off. There are options for how you\u2019d like to accomplish this. Maybe you prefer the Plasma Cutter, Pulse Rifle, or the Ripper, which shoots saw blades. I\u2019ve become attached to the Force Gun, a Dead Space 2 acquisition, which uses the game\u2019s gravity manipulation module, Kinesis, to blast away necromorphs until they become piles of rattled bones. I do that a lot. I blast away babies with tendrils unfurling from their back while they spit some green acid at my Isaac, who ejects a low groan or a gravelly scream in response.

And this isn\u2019t a change, but it\u2019s also worth noting that Dead Space\u2019s gameplay on PS5 is clean\u2014aside from a minor irritation where starting the game back up after saving at a checkpoint immobilized Issac, so I had to close and restart the game on a few occasions\u2014 which annoyingly feels like a rarity for new releases. I\u2019m happy that a game runs like it\u2019s supposed to. But Dead Space\u2019s visual improvement isn\u2019t as noticeable as Demon\u2019s Souls in 2020, and whether or not you like its tweaks and additions will come down to preference. I might have preferred if Isaac never spoke. He was, before, an empty bowl for players to place their own fears, their anxieties\u2014mine grew insistently the longer I spent hearing muffled moans reverberating throughout Ishimura. In the remake, Isaac speaks, but he never gives me anything to identify with or root for. He\u2019s following orders, and he wants to go home. Great, the same was true for nearly everyone else on Ishimura, and I\u2019ve been mindlessly chopping them into pieces. Why should I care if Isaac, in particular, lives or dies? When he takes off his mask, I don\u2019t even feel like I recognize him. The game\u2019s boss fights, as I mentioned, retain the boring, methodical process of the original. Hit the yellow boils until they pop. Move to the left if a tendril is about to hit you. Then to the right.When I fight a boss in one of the game\u2019s \u201czero gravity\u201d environments, I use my jetpack (on loan from Dead Space 2), to help me execute a similar strategy, zooming away from tendrils and floating versions of those exploding yellow sacs while I awkwardly try to steer an Asteroid Defense System cannon into a weak point. I win. Yay. What am I fighting for again?For love, maybe. Isaac wants to reunite with his girlfriend Nicole, a medical officer aboard the Ishimura who barely exists unless you pursue her optional side quest. But no, just as in 2008\u2019s Dead Space, the first letters of the game\u2019s chapter titles spell out N I C O L E I S D E A D, and love was never an option. In the game, it\u2019s a token, something developers put in just so you\u2019d be scared when you realized it wasn\u2019t actually there. It is, however, effective. I\u2019m scared while playing Dead Space, though that feeling alternates with a droopy sense that I\u2019m missing something, most likely the magic of 2008. I\u2019m missing out on a PC to run those sooty, grainy graphics in someone\u2019s dark dorm room. 15 years later, we have more compelling protagonists to choose from, and even more interesting space zombies, like those in Dead Space creator Glen Schofield\u2019s The Callisto Protocol, which is also mired by repetitive bosses, but at least looks and sounds incredible. The Dead Space remake accomplishes what it set out to do, it makes an old game compatible for modern consoles. But that\u2019s all it does. 2008\u2019s lightning stays in its bottle. \u00a0\nDestructoid, darkIt\u2019s been 15 years since Dead Space first hit the Xbox 360, and a lot has happened since then.

With the prospect of reviving a dormant but well-remembered franchise, EA Motive has quite a task.For the most part, though, Motive has managed to revive the spirit while reimagining the container. The Dead Space remake frequently surprised me, both in how it put twists on familiar moments and still held true to the spirit of the original. Those fans who have been hoping for their limb-cutting, boot-stomping blend of action and body horror to arrive should be satisfied in Motive\u2019s take on Dead Space.Dead Space\u00a0(PS5 [reviewed], Xbox Series X|S, PC) Developer: Motive Publisher: Electronic Arts Released: January 27, 2023 MSRP: $69.99The crux of Dead Space is still the same: engineer Isaac Clarke and a small band of operatives are responding to a distress call from the planet-cracking USG Ishimura, a station that\u2019s also home to Isaac\u2019s long-distance partner Nicole. A crash-landing leads the crew to begin exploring a ship that\u2019s clearly fallen into disrepair, and they soon learn why as screaming, terrifying horrors dubbed \u201cnecromorphs\u201d start crawling out of the air ducts, straight for their throats.Some of the most noticeable differences between Motive\u2019s remake and the original Dead Space are in the story. To be clear, broad story beats are still intact. But the way they happen, how characters are introduced or even possibly perish are changed, and things just play out a bit differently than you may remember. It\u2019s not quite at the scale of Resident Evil 2, but there\u2019s enough that I kept opening up old videos and surprising myself at how Motive had reimagined this story.\u00a0Even the way Isaac gets from chapter to chapter has changed, thanks to a few new ways for him to get around the Ishimura. The zero-gravity moment from later Dead Space replaces the swimmer-kick-and-launch from the 2008 Dead Space, and the results are pretty great. I did find reorienting was a bit awkward, so I spent a decent chunk of my zero-G time flying parallel to the \u201cfloor.\u201d Still, sections that felt a bit stiff in the original now feel way more fluid and mobile in the remake.Speaking of stiff, forget the old turret sequences. Rather than sitting in a chair and firing cannons at asteroids, the turret-centric portions take on a more active approach. I won\u2019t say too much more, but Motive took those, some of my least favorite sequences in the original, and made them some standout sections.The tram is also a bit different, serving as the fast-travel hub for a much more open Ishimura. Node doors have been done away with, and you\u2019re encouraged to backtrack more through Isaac\u2019s Security Clearance level, which bumps up at different points in the story. It makes sections where you\u2019re treading back through old haunts feel a bit fresher, as there may be new treasure to discover.Something that I didn\u2019t gel quite as well with were the side quests. Motive has introduced a few side quests that expand the narrative of the game, diving deeper into certain characters or different sides of the Ishimura crew. While I enjoyed the drive and some of the content itself, actually back-tracking for these objectives felt a bit hollow, as it usually just meant walking back through old corridors, following my basketball-dribble waypoint line to its next target. Some are gated by security level too, something you might not realize until you get there and find out you can\u2019t open the right door yet.When the narrative takes drastically different turns, though, it really works. A few moments have some massive added drama and tension, characters from the original shine in new ways, and the remade versions of them look fantastic. Isaac even speaks and removes the helmet a few times, with his Dead Space 2 and 3 voice actor Gunner Wright lending his voice. It works really well, and builds up the big dramatic swings very well.Visually, Dead Space looks great. I mostly stuck to Performance mode on my PlayStation 5, opting for the 60 FPS that made the action feel crisp and responsive. Even then, when not on the ultra-high scale settings, Dead Space looks good. Seeing all the rusted metal and occasional glints of light, contrasting the shadows where fleshy, lumpen necromorphs waited to pounce, felt like seeing Dead Space the way I remembered it.Still, so much of what drew me to Dead Space is still here.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5f76ef7-b9a4-4449-985d-e51db35e6a32": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5f76ef7-b9a4-4449-985d-e51db35e6a32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae7ed3b1-8e16-4cad-9240-2f65732a5ae3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e1838d029e962cfa22177dde166957adf8a136502d34c9585f4e000e6971765"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e1b0dfa-3420-4dc3-80c5-be1c7c53cc6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3e95d3c191b733cf819d7cdae19211fa5b54b02ee7c99eba71053b873d940df"}}, "hash": "f637c0a77170a94ce0ef2c7f779db1a853bf2e513be04b29263fa1ff34773c9b", "text": "Isaac is an engineer, trying to survive on a mining ship, so his implements and arsenal are all improvised from tools not normally meant for such violence. The Plasma Cutter rips through limbs, the Ripper slices through bodies, and the Force Gun lets out a deafening boom with each discharge. And yes, the chopping is still good. Blowing off a necromorph\u2019s claw, grabbing it with Kinesis and sending it flying back still feels great.There\u2019s something about this era of game design that still shines through, and still hasn\u2019t been lost in the update. Dead Space rarely wrests the controller away from me. And everything in its world is reactive and tumbling into each other. In one zero-G section, I was trying to line up an explosive container, to blast towards a pesky wall-clinging necromorph, when it lunged at me. I dodged to the side, still holding onto the container with my Kinesis ability, and watched as it slammed face-first into the barrel and blew itself up. It would\u2019ve been brilliant had I planned it, but was even better in the way I hadn\u2019t.My absolute favorite moment of playing the remake happened during a tense fight. Necromorphs were crawling out of vents and gutters, cornering me on a narrow walkway, and I pulled out my Line Gun. I figured putting a laser trap on a handrail would give me a nice way to stem the tide, and slow down my pursuers as I fought for better ground. My shot went a little wide though, and instead of landing on the rail, it attached itself to a necromorph\u2019s head.Rather than shutting off, the laser activated. Now, normally, the laser would act as a wire, running from its origin point to an endpoint directly across, slicing enemies in half as they tried to walk through it. Well, that origin point was now attached to an angry necromorph\u2019s head, and the laser now emitting from his dome was whipping around the room, like I had startled Cyclops from the X-Men.These moments, of interactivity and reactivity, are the heart of Dead Space for me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly scarier than other action-leaning survival horror games. It\u2019s certainly demanding, asking me to count my inventory and savor every health pack, making calculated risks by selling items for precious nodes that can upgrade my weapons or armor. Isaac is slow and not meant for acrobatics, and the weapons can feel clunky in a good way, mirroring how Isaac is repurposing his Space Home Depot loadout for real-time alien downsizing. Stomps made my haptics rumble, and instant deaths were brutal and quick, punctuated by the trademark flatline blaring in my speakers.What Dead Space still nails, alongside the atmosphere and a story that\u2019s given some extra momentum from Motive\u2019s tweaks, is the fast and evolving survival situations. It\u2019s walking into a room, seeing a red barrel in one corner and some stompable crates in another, and knowing you\u2019re about to get ambushed. It\u2019s questioning every air vent you see, and smiling when the game\u2019s intensity director gives it a little spin, just to keep you on your toes. It is my wildly flailing laser-head zombie, slashing up his compatriots and taking a chunk out of me in the process. I couldn\u2019t even be mad. It was just good.There are some hitches that I ran into, from some odd menu fuzziness to pick-ups that would stubbornly refuse to be picked up, and even some weird save issues\u2014nothing that killed my progress, but definitely enough to keep me a bit cautious.It feels great to just dive back into the USG Ishimura, though. Dead Space as a concept still holds up, and the reworking EA Motive has provided highlights its best features while shoring up old pitfalls. Sci-fi survival horror fans should get what they want out of this: the return of a classic, with gorgeous graphics and some new twists, but the same old boot-stomping good time.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back.

Despite being a huge fan of survival horror, my path has never crossed with any of the games in the trilogy. With the remake, I aimed to fix that, while also providing a perspective from someone who has played through with modern expectations and without rose-tinted eyewear. Does this remake of a 2008 game hold up in 2023? Absolutely, yes, though it doesn\u2019t achieve its glow-up without some struggle.Dead Space is as incredible a survival horror experience as it was nearly 15 years ago. In 2023, many upgrades have been made to elevate this experience for both newcomers and veterans alike. But now it\u2019s untethered from last-gen consoles and fully focused on current-gen and PC, I was expecting these upgrades to propel the remake into successfully achieving the balance between performance and visual fidelity that has become an industry standard. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t quite the case.Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Dead Space remake looks much better than the screenshots I\u2019ve seen of the original. I found myself regularly stopping to snap photos, inspired by the environmental art. While the original wasn\u2019t bad looking by any means, the remake feels denser with detail, with special care and attention put into each area.But, when assessing the visuals on PS5, I ran into disappointment. The game\u2019s 60 FPS mode \u2060\u2014 a staple for any current-gen title that wants to be taken seriously \u2060\u2014 comes at a significant cost. Whether it\u2019s a drop in resolution, the poor implementation of anti-aliasing, or both, the Dead Space remake suffers from a combination of blurriness and aliasing. With excellent upscaling technologies now available, I was shocked to see these compromised visuals.Do the slightly blurry visuals and aliasing issues mean the game is unplayable? No, of course not, and I imagine the majority of players won\u2019t even notice them. However, for a remake where the main priority is to overhaul the presentation, I\u2019m a tad disappointed.Thankfully, the Dead Space remake\u2019s audio almost makes up for the visual concerns. It sounds phenomenal, both in and out of combat. I highly encourage headphones, for those brave enough. Developer Motive Studio has gone to great lengths to improve the audio, responding to community feedback from its playtesting sessions with upgraded weapon sounds, and making its hideous Necromorph monsters even more intimidating.My only issue with the sound design is that audio cues sometimes ruin potential jump scares. A few hours in and players will be able to predict when enemies are about to appear. It doesn\u2019t happen too often, but it\u2019s a shame when it does.Another highlight is that main protagonist Isaac has a voice and face now, which he apparently didn\u2019t before. Gunner Wright plays the engineer/killing machine and delivers a great performance that is complemented by the supporting cast. The interactions are believable and the desperation is, at times, palpable.The game rarely pauses for a cutscene, instead having a video feed pop up during live gameplay.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40305e5f-3cd5-4461-a774-4ed2249c9e83": {"__data__": {"id_": "40305e5f-3cd5-4461-a774-4ed2249c9e83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e1b0dfa-3420-4dc3-80c5-be1c7c53cc6f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a3e95d3c191b733cf819d7cdae19211fa5b54b02ee7c99eba71053b873d940df"}, "3": {"node_id": "df8f70e4-53e0-4dc0-86f3-d1aa8bca6719", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "072cfa7b4f42e8486d0f1d59cdb994d77d8b55ea36620d962f14bf2cc875410d"}}, "hash": "c61e278f8feeaae35a88a88fdebdbe622d7b0f30f7fc68d4de2ae319fb177526", "text": "This works well to keep the intensity level high, with no breaks for the player and forcing constant immersion, whether they like it or not.

Unfortunately, things immediately go awry and Isaac is soon fighting for his life. The bulk of the game takes place on the Ishimura, a maze of larger rooms connected by tight corridors. The repetitive aesthetic is solved by each area being in a varying state of disrepair. Highlights include areas that are fully open to space, with Isaac impacted by gravity and a lack of oxygen. While the game is confined within a single ship, text and audio logs help to flesh out the wider universe.

Coming in at 10-12 hours for those playing on Normal difficulty, this introduction to the series is the perfect length.Necromorphs are the key ingredient to the incredibly satisfying combat system. After decades of aiming for the head in survival games, it was jarring to suddenly need to aim for limbs. However, dismemberment is the name of the game here, and legs and arms are in the crosshairs now. Whether it\u2019s surgically removing an explosive growth from an enemy using the Plasma Cutter, or peppering foes with Pulse Rifle fire in a panic as Isaac fights to keep his distance, all of the weapons in Dead Space Remake feel wonderfully lethal.Then there\u2019s Isaac\u2019s stomp. Man, this guy clearly has some pent-up rage that he\u2019s been waiting to unleash on alien corpses. Aliens (and innocent humans\u2026) will break apart from the sheer force of Isaac\u2019s stomp. It\u2019s a great way of checking if an enemy is truly dead, and stomping bodies can result in extra loot, so it\u2019s a win-win.When Isaac isn\u2019t shooting and stomping enemies into pieces, he\u2019s tasked with solving relatively easy puzzles and backtracking to unlock new doors that he has gained access to. The main enemy of Dead Space isn\u2019t the Necromorphs, but the ship which is rapidly falling apart. Every time Isaac gets a new Key Item and takes it to its home, something breaks and then he\u2019s off to find another. It soon becomes a comedy of errors, with Isaac and his crewmates having the absolute worst luck.Upon completion, New Game Plus is unlocked in addition to new rewards and objectives. For those looking to spend an extra 10+ hours with the game, perhaps to justify the sting of that $70 console launch price, the Dead Space remake makes a convincing argument for going through again. After all, there\u2019s the \u201cImpossible\u201d difficulty for those who really want to put themselves through hell.For those who already love the franchise and are simply hoping for a spruced-up version of the original game, then the Dead Space remake is an easy recommendation, so long as you\u2019re okay with paying the $70 price (or waiting for a sale). However, for those who have no pre-existing affection for Isaac and his dismemberment skills, more convincing is likely required. Happily, even with my modern expectations, the Dead Space remake still delivers a fantastic narrative, a wonderfully presented setting, and compelling gameplay that satisfies from the first terrifying moment until the horrific last.8Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100.

Contact was lost with a \u201cPlanet Cracker\u201d mining ship known as the USG Ishimura in the orbit of an off-limits world known as Aegis VII. With such a sizable investment on the line, a team is dispatched to check in on the ship and discover the fate of its crew. The player takes up the mantle of aeronautics engineer Isaac Clarke, whose girlfriend, Nicole Brennan, was a doctor on board the Ishimura. It doesn\u2019t take long for everything to go to heck. The Ishimura is infested with brutal, bloodthirsty creatures that seem to be mutated versions of the ship\u2019s crew. Isaac and company\u2019s ship they arrived on is soon destroyed by the monsters and with various systems of the Ishimura failing, it\u2019s up to the rescue crew to repair what they can and try to escape the insanity.The first thing returning players will notice is that Isaac talks in this game. Where he was once a stoic pile of grunts, groans, and screams, Isaac now engages in the conversations between his crew. I liked that. Gunner Wright once again fills the voice role of Clarke and you can tell from jump street just how comfy he is with delivering Isaac\u2019s dialogue and reactions to everything. The same can\u2019t always be said of every bit of dialogue in Dead Space though. Despite the fact that they\u2019re trapped on a ship full of ravenous monsters that want to mutilate them, everyone feels just a bit too brusque with their dialogue, if not unusually calm.It doesn\u2019t detract from the core experience, though. These folks are accessories to the true stars of the show, which are the Ishimura, its monsters, and the tools Isaac uses to kill them before they can kill him. The redesigned Ishimura is a masterful tapestry of disturbing design, well crafted from the trappings of the original. The flashing lights, various technology (both working and failing), and remnants of panic, violence, and chaos are rebuilt smartly, adding details both grandiose and minute to what was already an amazing environment to explore. It\u2019s further aided by the fact that the game is almost always seamless in its transitions. Once you load into your adventure, you\u2019ll pretty much never see loading screens again. Dead Space 2023 plays smooth like butter and the impeccable level of quality in its performance makes sure you never have stuttering pulling away from the fear, tension, and action.The soundscape is better than ever too. Dead Space is one of the few games I always want dead silence around me. The director system of the game makes sure that enemies could come at you from any angle at any time. In the stark quiet, I was always looking around me carefully to make sure I wasn\u2019t getting hit in the back by an unnoticed assailant. Its louder points are magnificent too. Whether you\u2019re hearing the panicked music of an incoming enemy assault or just the grinding, whirring, screeching, buzzing, and other chaos of the ship\u2019s systems, this remake kept me on my toes, listening and watching carefully just as much if not more than the original.If you think you know exactly what weapons you want to use when it comes to Dead Space 2023 based on your experience with the original, I\u2019m here to tell you to reconsider the whole arsenal. There were definitely weapons in the 2008 Dead Space I wrote off because they didn\u2019t fit what I wanted, but in this Dead Space, they all felt viable to me in one way or another. The Plasma Cutter still does exactly what it used to, but the Pulse Rifle brings Dead Space 2 and 3\u2019s proximity mine alternate fire into play whether you want to make a trap or run it as an underbarrel grenade launcher.Likewise, I had completely shelved the Flamethrower in the original game because it sucked. Not so here. Not only is it great for keeping large groups of enemies in check, but its new alternate fire pitches out a flame wall that stops the approach of most enemies and gives you some breathing room to focus on other threats. Where it was an insta-drop into Item Storage in 2008, the Flamethrower was one of my most used weapons here.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba111b52-a9d1-4398-b973-9af355552494": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba111b52-a9d1-4398-b973-9af355552494", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "df8f70e4-53e0-4dc0-86f3-d1aa8bca6719", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "072cfa7b4f42e8486d0f1d59cdb994d77d8b55ea36620d962f14bf2cc875410d"}, "3": {"node_id": "e15b1829-bc0b-4e01-b3d5-8b52a02f503c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb1da3a9f90b8d9786a43f7fb0ae2fd74342229cb3e6136c04d978bd2f7d9b5d"}}, "hash": "a01e5c979e16e86dff142c882b3eb65e6997d66f661343de8ebd6a8996bf809b", "text": "Other weapons feel equally improved in their performance and I couldn\u2019t really give you a reason why I wouldn\u2019t use one other than I just liked others more.Enemies and encounters also feel well-improved. I have a long history of getting really annoyed when a horror game gives me an arsenal that makes me feel like any enemies I come across are trivial. Dead Space has the arsenal, but I never felt overconfident. First off, it throws a reasonable amount of enemies at you at nearly every juncture, eating up your ammo if you intend to fight them off. On medium difficulty, I always felt like I was scraping by for every clip of ammo and every precious medkit keeping me alive. I never ran out, thankfully, but I felt a distinct gut cramp every single time I missed a crucial shot or took a hit I felt like I could have avoided. In short, I was nearly always on edge and that\u2019s the way I feel it ought to be if you\u2019re going to give me so many weapons.Some of the encounters and set pieces in this remake have been hugely improved over their original counterparts, as well. There\u2019s a certain part where asteroids are pummeling the Ishimura and Isaac has to do something about that. The original \u201con-rails shooter\u201d approach to this was one of my least favorite parts of the 2008 Dead Space. Here, EA Motive reworked that section entirely and not only does it avoid sucking fun out of part of the game, but it actually feels perfectly sensible the way you go about it. I was really dreading playing that part and EA Motive turned it into a fun and intense, yet sensible segment. There are some encounters that play almost 1:1 to the original, but the parts where EA Motive took liberties make sense and generally paid off to make a good thing even better.Unfortunately, finding your way to the next location wasn\u2019t always one of those things. Dead Space has always had this pinging system where Isaac reveals a holographic digital line that will point him in the direction of his next objective. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m misremembering, but here in the remake, that line fades away much too fast. I often had to objective ping multiple times, especially if the directions went behind Isaac, simply because I didn\u2019t see where they were pointing before they were gone. A minor inconvenience, but it was one I had to deal with all game.I will say, Dead Space ups its gore game to the max with some extremely impressive shredding mechanics. You\u2019ll see the flesh, muscle, blood, and bone strip away from enemies with every shot, visually telling you what kind of damage you\u2019re doing. However, this includes ragdoll physics when you blow a monster\u2019s limb off or kill them. In my experience, there was no lack of janky ragdolls just spasming all over the floor. I appreciate the attention to detail in the gore, but sometimes the silly ragdoll effects pulled me out of the tension. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy a good, silly ragdoll dance. It\u2019s just hard to remain locked into the scares when a dead foe is going all whack-a-doo on the ground.That said, the Dead Space Remake has a lot to enjoy even after you roll credits, too. There\u2019s a New Game+ in which you can discover secrets and even a new ending that can\u2019t be obtained in the first run. Just as well, for the truly insane and hardcore, the highest difficulty features a new suit and reward for Isaac if you can manage to complete it. With a campaign already easily clocking in at double digit hours, there\u2019s a ton of game to enjoy here.When Dead Space originally came out in 2008, it revitalized a stagnant genre. Horror was in a slump from too much of the same thing and well-known franchises leaning more towards action. In came EA and Visceral Games to turn the genre on its head and give us something truly innovative and terrifying to play, a new spark to ignite the fear we were deprived of at the time. Remaking that is a tall order, so I\u2019ve been nervous about EA Motive\u2019s attempt from the get-go, but I\u2019m happy to admit, my fears were unfounded. Not only is the 2023 Dead Space remake good, it takes everything that made the 2008 game good and makes it better, even outright swapping out certain weak points of the original to make a top-to-bottom must play for anyone looking for a good scare in their games.

These alien horrors, alongside undertones of religious fanaticism, make the USG Ishimura one of the most terrifying settings in the survival horror genre.In the same vein as Alien: Isolation, there is something so claustrophobic about being marooned in outer space; the immediate threat of body-horror aliens, the religious fanatics encouraging them to feed, and this huge vessel with a myriad of broken\u2026 everything. It gets in your head. Dead Space is a test of Isaac\u2019s patience and resilience, and as you reach the third act of the game, you can tell that he\u2019s wearing thin.There are no safe spaces, and there is no escape from the USG Ishimura. Even in rooms with Save Stations and Stores, you can\u2019t be sure that a Lurker or Slasher won't appear. This feeling of insecurity is paired with a satisfying combat system that Dead Space wouldn't feel the same without. Your headshots don't matter aboard the USG Ishimura. It's all about dismemberment. With abilities such as Stasis and Kinesis letting you slow enemies down and impale them with common items, combat is overwhelming at first. The second that you get into the swing of things, however, you can become incredibly creative when slaying hordes of Necromorphs. Thanks to Dead Space\u2019s 'Intensity Director', the spawn of hostile enemies and the way lighting or audio functions can be entirely unique to your personal experience of the game, so fights won't play out the same. You know what this means? You truly never know what to expect. This, accompanied by a terrifying score, ensures that Dead Space will get under your skin as much as it does Isaac's.\r\nDead Space\u2019s music and orchestral scoring reaches haunting peaks that echo the work of John Carpenter (why is he not directing the Dead Space film again?), but not just when you\u2019re in danger; the score will creep up on you and terrify you even during moments of safety. At no point does Dead Space choose to slow down; it constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat and has you questioning everything with various crescendos and racing tempos. What was that apparition? Why is Nicole talking about Isaac 'making everyone whole again'? What\u2019s actually going on here?Dead Space has a plot that is genuinely interesting, and when it comes to piling on the tension, it doesn\u2019t rely on cheap scares, either. If anything, the game serves as a master class in creating tension and suspense effectively in horror games \u2013 even now, some 15 years after the original launched.

You\u2019re thinking that you\u2019re safe now, and that the Necromorph pursuing you definitely can\u2019t fit in here. Suddenly, it\u2019s bursting through the door, and you\u2019ve spat out your drink that you thought you were finally safe to have a sip of. Or, you\u2019re walking down a long corridor when the turbine at the end suddenly breaks. You immediately aim your gun and prepare for trouble, but in this instance, it was a false alarm; now you\u2019re on edge all over again for no reason.And that is just two basic scares of many that work to keep your attention focused on Isaac and the USG Ishimura at all times. I could talk for hours about all the thrills Dead Space has tucked away within it, but if you know, you know. And if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s better experienced for yourself.\r\nWhen the music isn\u2019t lulling you into a false sense of security, or you\u2019re not fending off acid-spitting infants who can climb walls, you\u2019re taking in the environment. The lighting, the fog, the film-grain. Top this off with no UI whatsoever. Dead Space knows how to keep you immersed. That is, until, the latter half of the game. As Chapter 7 unfolded, and I continued with the mission at hand, gameplay began to feel messy, and repetitive. What started out as pristine pacing soon became a blur; at one point, it felt as though every other room I entered became a quarantine zone where I was to take on a horde. After that, it felt like puzzles were endless, and combat was minimal. \r\nWhile repetitive tasks ruined my immersion in the latter half, I couldn\u2019t help but think that this somewhat worked in the Dead Space's favour. After all, could you imagine how Isaac feels by the time the final chapter of the game rolls around? His mental state slowly deteriorates as time goes on, and reaching the final chapters with both player and player character feeling worn thin really brought Isaac's experience to the foreground. That said \u2013 even with my afterthoughts excusing the repetitive nature of the game \u2013 this wasn\u2019t the only issue I encountered.\r\nOn more than one occasion, my game unfortunately broke. Playing on Xbox Series S, I encountered a few instances in which my game would freeze, usually on death, and have to be restarted. This, on top of enemies that were glitching all over the show, took me out of this carefully curated, intentionally crafted world.Enemies would sometimes stand in front of me, staring and doing nothing, and more often than not, if I killed an enemy in a location such as a doorway or corner, its corpse would spasm to no end and in the worst of cases, fly around the room. This led to a lot of confusion when taking on hordes of Necromorphs, and regularly resulted in me stomping an entire room to smithereens just to ensure everything was actually dead. That said, Dead Space\u2019s auto-save feature often came in clutch, and I hope to see these minor quality-of-life issues fixed in the near future.\r\nFinally, let\u2019s not neglect our protagonist, space-faring engineer Isaac, too. He talks this time around, giving him a little more personality and emotional flesh, and he\u2019s pivotal in making you feel anxious. After a tense time fighting The Hunter and dealing with the perils of maniacal Dr. Mercer, I took a short break, and having just saved, I didn\u2019t pause my game.As I sat there scrolling through my notes, I could even hear my own heartbeat in my head. My physical reaction to the game made me feel more scared, until I realised after checking my BPM that it was not, in fact, my heart. It was Isaac\u2019s. I listened a little more carefully and could hear him also catching his breath. I was actually fine, but I didn\u2019t feel fine.\r\nDead Space doesn\u2019t just place you into the role of Isaac Clarke, it forces you into his head, too. You\u2019re constantly questioning if the apparitions he is seeing are real, and his physical reaction to the unbelievable events aboard the space ship only fuel yours further.

The new developers, Motive, recognized the importance of the original game and tried to stay as faithful to its vision as possible. As a result, the story essentially remains the same, with the most significant changes they made to item locations and puzzles to fit their newly added features. You might be hesitant to purchase yet another expensive remake because you feel you will be let down, and it will ruin all of those glorious memories of when you played the game 15 years ago. Trust me, I was the same, but let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised, and you will be too.Dead Space Remake is set aboard the USG Ishimura, a massive mining ship classified as a planet cracker. The ship is 5,300 feet and 1,550 feet tall and features nine decks with seven subsections. It was home to 1332 crew members before the Necromorph infection, where it served as both a mining vessel and medical research and development vessel while orbiting Aegis VII.I provided the above facts about the Ishimura to give you an idea of how massive it is and why it provides a perfect space for the Dead Space game to take place in. From the Medical Deck to the Hydroponics Deck to the Tram Station, you will experience what it is like to be aboard a space station in astonishing detail that will hit all your senses. But, of course, the Ishimura is not just a space station but an infested space station, which is every sci-fi lover\u2019s dream and nightmare. So what would you do if you were in Ellen Ripley\u2019s shoes?No sci-fi game would be complete without experiencing space, and you will get to see this firsthand with the damaged parts of the Ishimura, letting in the void that is space to make your journey that much more difficult. Navigate the difficulties of Zero-G and no-oxygen environments while solving puzzles and fighting Necromorphs.At the start of Dead Space Remake, we meet Isaac Clarke, voiced by Gunner Wright, and the rest of the USG Kellion crew: Corporal Aiden Chen, Corporal Johnston, Computer Specialist Kendra Daniels, and Senior Security Officer Zach Hammond. I enjoyed my reunion with the Kellion crew after 15 years and had to remind myself that they weren\u2019t long for this world. When Chen met his untimely demise at the beginning of the game, I clasped my hand to my mouth in shock and awe because it was more brutal than I remembered.As the game progresses, we meet the USG Ishimura crew through holographic recordings, voice logs, and text documents that unravel what happened to the USG Ishimura, its crew, and the colony on Aegis VII. So with these logs, we learn that Ishimura was more than just mining, and the crew members we meet show us two sides of the coin. The first is the poor unsuspecting crew members who were there to do their jobs. The second is those who knew the real reason for their journey and were trying to figure out the horrors that unfolded unknown to the rest of the crew.Our story takes place in 2508, when Isaac Clarke and his fellow crew members on the USG Kellion were dispatched to the USG Ishimura, known as a planet cracker, for an emergency maintenance mission to find and repair the cause of the communications blackout. Unfortunately, Clarke and crew realize things aren\u2019t right, as no one answers their initial hails. Once aboard the Ishimura, in spectacular fashion, if I might add, things quickly take a horrific turn. This is when they find the crew of the Ishimura is all slaughtered, and mysterious creatures called Necromorphs are roaming the massive mining ship. To make matters worse, Clarke\u2019s partner, Dr. Nicole Brennan, has gone missing with the rest of the crew. Can Clarke survive the Necromorph infection and find Nicole while keeping his crumbling sanity intact?I love this story. I loved it when the original game came out in 2008 and loved it with the Remake. The visual updates and 3D atmospheric audio allowed me to experience it repeatedly and did not disappoint. I played Dead Space Remake with my Steam Deck using headphones while laying in bed late at night with the lights off. This created an eerie atmosphere that got my heart racing and made me invested in Clarke\u2019s survival during most parts of the game. This feeling is why I love horror games and feel Dead Space Remake successfully earned its immersive survival horror tag.Like most, my love for sci-fi horror comes from the movies Alien and Aliens.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7e26a5d-920b-4355-8c4b-61a5ffedfb15": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7e26a5d-920b-4355-8c4b-61a5ffedfb15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "111714e0-fe87-49bb-9c3f-004810105ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "28df412f3c0cf8731d16b0b47f286c32afc514fac5974491527e635afaf61d3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "f478685b-9e69-4d97-8938-7b5524caaf58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "205663c07118749eda1fee6865b5e97a52a91215699c70a7bf1d551df3533079"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d1df3f3-c9fd-49d6-b69e-5539a8d42f01", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "467e3f875b2a681ebbe22dfe3e29cfc8b55416a9a1f26aa157c7cae170812d20"}}, "hash": "37218fe06fc4a3131ca0f71f952faf96347bc18d685e77a45bd8bbda187b87bd", "text": "While they are two completely different movies, with Alien firmly rooted in the survival-horror genre and Aliens in the third-person shooter genre, I feel Dead Space Remake owns both genres and does it exceptionally well.In parts of the game, I felt like Ripley on the Nostromo as I traversed the Ishimura while constantly watching out for Necromorphs from sneaking up on me in an ever-changing environment. Dead Space Remake includes a new AI-driven system called the Intensity Director, which comprises content organization, spawning, and a pacing control system. There are over 1200 unique events with a countless variety of combinations possible. This allows the game to adapt and change from room to room, which adds to the uneasy feeling of not knowing what you will encounter at any moment. This includes Necromorphs spawning in a wall vent, lights turning off, showers turning on, and fog making visibility difficult. The goal was to create peaks and valleys of tension and a unique playing experience for every player.In other parts, I felt like the Colonial Marines from Aliens as I was going toe-to-toe with waves of Necromorphs using weapons, modules, and the environment to defeat them. While the Necromorphs were challenging to beat, I never felt underpowered because of the Remake\u2019s better weapon upgrades and alt-fire modes. The combat was also satisfying because of the game\u2019s new peeling system, which represents the damage you are causing to the Necromorphs when shooting them through the visual representation of meat chunks falling off them. This was an excellent feature because slicing off the limbs of Necromorphs is a massive part of combat, and it just adds to the realism and feeling of going up against them.The burning question that you and most folks that haven\u2019t bought Dead Space Remake are asking is how the Remake holds up to the Original and whether it is with the hefty price tag. Let me answer this question right away by giving you a resounding yes. My answer is yes. I\u2019ve already discussed some reasons above, like the game has no loading screens, which add to the immersion, the Intensity Director, visual improvements and 3D sounds, improvements to the existing weapon, and upgrade systems. But, if that isn\u2019t enough to get you to buy the game, additional features include New Game Plus and new side quests that delve deeper into the story. In addition, this alternate ending fits the game much better than the original, and the new traversal uses Zero-G. I can preach about the game all day, but I want you to experience it firsthand.We are frustrated that the things we love are being ruined due to being rebooted or remade. Whether it is done poorly, taken from a bygone era, or made so different, it\u2019s riding on the coattails of the original\u2019s successes. We don\u2019t like seeing our favorite things that aren\u2019t up to our standards. When this happens, we scream at whoever will listen that they should never have been touched. It is then scarce for something to be better while still being faithful to the original, and we need to praise it when it happens. This is the case with Dead Space Remake because it is better than the original in every way.The first time I died while playing Dead Space Remake on Impossible Mode, I couldn\u2019t help but say Hudson\u2019s iconic line from Aliens: \u201cGame Over, Man! Game Over!\u201d to myself as I started the game over. While watching the intro cutscene, I couldn\u2019t help but snicker to myself because of it. When I beat the game on Impossible Mode, I breathed a sigh of relief and smiled, knowing I was about to have a ton of fun playing on New Game Plus with the game\u2019s foam finger.After watching the game\u2019s alternate ending, I wanted a Dead Space 2 Remake because, in my book, Motive has proven that they can remake one of my most cherished games, and I want to experience the rest of the franchise as I did with Dead Space Remake. I know you will love this Remake just as much as I did.\n- This article was updated on February 2nd, 2023 \nMatthew Kevin Mitchell has been a contributing writer for Attack of the Fanboy and PC Invasion since 2022.
