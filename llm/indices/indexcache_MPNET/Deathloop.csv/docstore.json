You can invade someone else's game, and be invaded in turn.\nLink Official siteArkane Studios is calling me out. It knows how I played Dishonored 2\u2014my habit of quickloading away any mistake in pursuit of a perfect stealth playthrough. And given that almost 30% of Steam players have the Ghostly achievement for finishing a mission without ever being spotted, I suspect I'm not alone. Despite having a suite of tools for dealing with messy situations, we ignored them in favour of the most OP button on our keyboard: F9. With Deathloop, Arkane is removing the crutch. Quicksave is gone.Deathloop is all about what happens when things don't go to plan; about panic and improvisation; about learning from a mistake, and taking those lessons forward. Trapped in a time loop, it doesn't matter if you botch your way through combat encounter after combat encounter\u2014it doesn't even matter if you die and get kicked back to the beginning of the day. All that matters is that, in doing so, you gained some information that will help you the next time around.Information is your primary objective in Deathloop\u2014it's how you find and kill the Visionaries that act as the bosses of the island. There are eight in total, and your job as the amnesiac Colt Vahn is to take them all out in a single day in order to break the loop. Your problem is that your day is split into four chunks\u2014morning, noon, afternoon and evening\u2014and you can only visit one of the island's four areas during each period. The Visionaries only appear in certain locations at certain times of the day, and at first it doesn't seem possible to kill them all before the loop resets and your work is undone.As you dig into the lives of your hit list, though, you'll uncover new ways to manipulate them. This is the bulk of the game, and your progress is tracked and updated as each new lead is uncovered. Colt is one of only two people whose memory remains intact when the day loops, which means his targets' behaviour remains consistent, and thus repeatable. It's immensely satisfying as the pieces start falling into place\u2014as you see the consequences of your actions, and start filling out your itinerary in preparation for that perfect day.The process of gathering information doesn't just apply to your primary objective, either. It turns out that looping repetition leads to a more organic sense of discovery that suits the immersive sim genre well. Arkane's level design is filled with secrets\u2014hidden routes and locked doors that hint at new approaches. In Dishonored, you were rewarded for patience and observation, for scouring through notes and diaries and searching in hidden corners. And you can do that in Deathloop, sure, but it also supports a more direct approach.My first visit to Aleksis's party in the Updaam district of Blackreef was an embarrassing disaster. It's the most dangerous area in the game\u2014all of the guests are packing heat\u2014and so my botched stealth attempt became a protracted hunt, as I desperately attempted to run and hide, only to be caught anew. In the end I prevailed, but only after killing every single person in the building. With that done, though, an opportunity presented itself. I was free to explore in peace; to work backwards from inside the building, digging out its quieter areas, and discovering the routes that linked them. When I returned the next day, I was prepared. It still descended into chaos in the end, but did so on my own terms.So far in this review, I've taken the stance that stealth is success, combat is failure. And I do think it's fair to call Deathloop a stealth game first-and-foremost.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b2befb0-7bd5-4ee1-a7ae-acd3ac9a9664": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b2befb0-7bd5-4ee1-a7ae-acd3ac9a9664", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6bdf2da-d13d-469d-acfb-d29465f5bfcb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "054888d3c79686774bd30c5c4d1506b615cf7502770739691d4c0883da11f7bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7bfd6e7-4c24-4291-8f32-934c55130ee7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ff91a7d0fa1c89b632c7beacf72c7e0520a17a87500b94496da2f1616d54003"}}, "hash": "c0dcabeeeedfda8fdd0be35d9a6a7c2fef446a4389195e2f3992e0f5d8690027", "text": "You hear it in the discordant audio cue that plays when you're spotted, and see it in the exclamation marks that appear over nearby Eternalists\u2014Deathloop's name for the rank and file revellers that will attack you on sight. The game's DNA is so heavily entwined with Dishonored\u2014from its powers, to its art style, to the very function of its UI\u2014that I naturally gravitated towards stealth as my de facto approach.Deathloop wants you to be pressured into slipping up; to cause a situation that you're forced to react to.But even with that mindset, it's clear that Deathloop wants to nudge you away from obsessing over a flawless run. When you take out an Eternalist, they instantly fade into a sort of swirling ethereal mist that others can detect and react to. That means you can't spend hours neatly clearing out the map, hiding each body so that your handiwork is never detected. Deathloop wants you to be pressured into slipping up; to cause a situation that you're forced to react to. And then, when you do, it lets its weapons and powers feel fun to use, and, crucially, never punishes you for taking advantage of them.At first, you start each day carrying only the basic weapons Colt has on him when he wakes up. Pretty early, though, you unlock the ability to infuse items\u2014letting you carry them between loops. This is done by spending residuum, a resource harvested during missions or earned by sacrificing other, unwanted bits of gear. Infusion lets you permanently unlock better equipment for use. The best, of course, is held by the Visionaries themselves, who carry high-tier guns, trinkets and a signature slab\u2014a power in the mould of Dishonored's supernatural abilities.You're restricted in the number of weapons and slabs you can take on a mission, so if you see something you want in the field, you'll have to swap it with something you're already carrying. Dropped weapons and slabs are, logically enough, unavailable for the rest of the day. But thanks to the properties of infusion they'll be waiting for you at the start of the next loop.Another early power lets you respawn twice on the map without dying and thus resetting your loop. This means you can shrug off the occassional stupid mistake or botched encounter. If you can successfully return to your body without dying again, you can retrieve the residuum off your corpse and carry on as normal. At every stage, the game is telling you not to worry. Enjoy yourself. Don't sweat the mistakes.You see, Arkane Studios is also calling out Arkane Studios; in particular Dishonored's central tension of giving the player a suite of tools for murder and mayhem, but using the story to admonish you for using them. There's no such thing as a non-lethal playthrough of Deathloop. Your basic stealth weapons are a machete and a nail gun. Colt's idea of a silent takedown is snapping an Eternalist's neck.You should be able to hit smooth framerates at 1080p at reasonable settings on reasonable hardware. Even on a GeForce 1650 Super, you're looking at an average 43fps at the Ultra preset. This is a shooter mind, so dropping down to the Medium preset will net you a slicker 60fps.\n\nIt's a similar story at 1440p on more capable hardware: Deathloop looks good and runs well. Push the resolution up to 4K though, and it isn't quite as flawless. On a GeForce RTX 3080 you're only looking at 53fps using the Ultra settings. The good news is there are plenty of settings to play with to make sure you get the most out of your hardware.It made sense for Dishonored to condemn killing\u2014its story would have been worse if it didn't\u2014but Deathloop's entire structure is built around the idea that everyone you murder will wake up none the wiser when the loop resets. So hey, here's an SMG with an intrinsic perk that recovers your health when you damage an enemy. Try pairing it with the Havoc slab, which makes you tougher and deadlier while it's active.You can tell that Wolfenstein's MachineGames played a role in Deathloop's development.

Throughout you'll find Eternalists enjoying the lack of consequences, vandalising the island and performing idiotic stunts over the course of the day. If death doesn't matter, why not shoot yourself out of a cannon?Throughout the game, there's a voice telling you that, actually, you love this. That's not me making some grand point about the duality of man or something: there's literally a voice\u2014one coming from the other end of your radio each time you step into a new level. It belongs to Julianna, the other person on the island whose memory persists through each day. Her job is to protect the loop by hunting and killing Colt. And it's a task she revels in.This cat-and-mouse relationship is the heart of Deathloop's story, and enhances the mystery of the loop, the island and Colt's past. As antagonistic as their conversations are, it's also clear Julianna enjoys their game. At one point she clarifies to Colt that she doesn't love watching him die, she simply loves killing him. There's a playfulness to her goading, but also an underlying frustration that makes uncovering the past that Colt can't remember all the more intriguing.Julianna's hunts are also the final piece of Deathloop's systemic puzzle, the thing that ties its various riffs on the immersive sim genre together. She can invade any level that contains a Visionary, and\u2014if you play with online enabled, at least\u2014will be controlled by another player. With an entire level as your playground, this leads to some incredibly tense encounters, but also plenty of slapstick shenanigans. Once, a player invaded me but didn't realise I'd already hacked some of the nearby turrets. They spawned, I heard a turret start to fire, and moments later the game told me Julianna had been killed.Colt is more heavily favoured in these encounters, because Julianna can't respawn when killed. Ultimately that imbalance is for the best. For Colt, the stakes are higher. Dying during the loop means losing access to any weapons or upgrades he gathered during that level\u2014as well as any picked up earlier in the day that haven't yet been infused. As Julianna, meanwhile, your progression is tied to feats performed during your hunts. Even if you don't end Colt's day, a decent performance will still net you points towards unlocking more weapons, powers and upgrades.Julianna's hunts are also the final piece of Deathloop's systemic puzzle, the thing that ties its various riffs on the immersive sim genre together.Ultimately, most Julianna encounters are resolved in an open firefight, which is the key to why so much of Deathloop is constructed the way it is. Why can I only equip a handful of weapons and powers? Because building a loadout is more interesting if Julianna is a potential threat. Throughout the game, I made heavy use of Shift\u2014Deathloop's version of Dishonored's Blink\u2014and Nexus\u2014Deathloop's version of Dishonored's Domino. Both were invaluable for reaching high-up spots where I could easily and silently take down groups of Eternalists.But as I progressed, I started to favour slabs like Aether, which turns Colt invisible, or Havoc, which makes him tougher and more deadly. These were picks specifically designed to counterplay an invasion. One of Aether's upgrades stops it from draining your power as long as you're standing still. It's the perfect tool for turning hunter into hunted\u2014I've caught more than a few invaders who decided to sprint across a section of the level, not realising I was near.Certain gun perks make more sense with Julianna in mind too. At first I wasn't sure why I'd ever need a version of the Fourpounder\u2014an absolute cannon of a handgun\u2014that creates a gas cloud at the point of impact. It can already dispatch Eternalists with a single headshot\u2014anything more seemed like overkill. But Julianna is tougher, and the damage-over-time causes players to panic. That can lead to funny interactions, like the time an invader shot at me through the flammable gas cloud, blowing themselves up in the process.For the first few hours of Deathloop, I was more interested in it as Arkane's response to Dishonored\u2014a series that I love.

There are some minor tweaks and changes, including all the accessibility options added over the last year as well as a new extended ending, but beyond that it's the same brilliant game, so here's our review of the original, first published in September 2021, to let you know a little more. Deathloop is about killing the people who are killing time. Set in an alternate 1970s that feels more like the far future of Dishonored's Gristol than part of Earth's history, it's a freeform, first-person mix of shooting, assassination, hacking and sorcery in which you wind and rewind a single day both to experiment with tools and manipulate targets such that you can massacre them all before darkness falls. The lead is Colt Vahn, a hulking amnesiac who - shortly after being hacked to death by a mysterious woman - wakes on a time-locked Arctic island overrun by a hedonistic Bond movie organisation called AEON. To undo the rippling Anomaly keeping the island's never-ending murder-party in motion, Colt must slay the eight \"Visionaries\" who preside over four, separately loading areas, which also involves digging into the island's buried secrets, slaughtering no end of rank-and-file \"Eternalists\", and unravelling the riddle of his own presence. Amongst the Visionaries is Julianna, the aforesaid mystery lady, incorrigible nuisance-caller and the game's second playable character, who stars in a multiplayer mode where you invade the worlds of other Colts and kill them for unlocks. What follows is a stylish, bloodthirsty and considerate reworking of ideas from Arkane's other games, which clears away a little of Dishonored's haughty perfectionism and grants you ample leeway to run amok. This is captured by the art direction, which retains Dishonored's brooding, salt-soaked shorelines but covers them with neon signboards, boutique low-poly statues and jaunty Space Age cabins - an upper cruster's carnival with heady overtones of Tarantino and Wolfenstein, perched atop the ruins of a much less forgiving game. I'm not sure it's Arkane's most adventurous or surprising work - for all the louder presentation, it sometimes pulls its punches.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8cf0ae0-c05e-45ef-a6eb-8c2447da96fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8cf0ae0-c05e-45ef-a6eb-8c2447da96fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "23a9ce81-ca6a-4530-99a0-836c5124946f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aae104504db63da78e8a297e5337f705ce6f770f59eae19061b9ca6dc20c3dd8"}, "3": {"node_id": "eddfed23-9efd-4ceb-a439-cbdd7d9a4fbb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "24384e43294c7b9bb7a5f238e03d6b4599c7f99f83621038a0173cd4e9006cde"}}, "hash": "1540be4864ba1a79db9866c1423fcdbebc567cb9e880c2b4b0089105f59f2226", "text": "But it might be Arkane's most straightforwardly enjoyable game. To begin with, Deathloop just feels like Dishonored with guns and gadgets pilfered from Q's workshop. Among the first tools the bleary-eyed Colt gets his hands on are a wireless hackamajig for use against security sensors and automated turrets, and a fancy bomb that can be morphed into a tripwire, a landmine or a grenade. You could play through the entire game with just these devices, mining chokepoints and creatively rearranging the defences. But you'll have much more fun if you make use of Slabs, magical abilities plucked from the cooling bodies of the Visionaries. Shift is Deathloop's version of Blink, the short-ranged teleport that propelled Arkane to stardom back in 2012. It's still an absolute showstopper, elegantly abbreviating the process of creeping and flanking, and providing easy access to the island's many rooftops, towers and subterranean facilities. As superpowers go, it's rivalled only by Nexus, aka Dishonored 2's Domino, which links adversaries such that what happens to one happens to all. Unlike with Domino there's no hard limit on the number of Nexus connections, allowing you to silence a heaving dancefloor with a single bullet. Or you could launch all those dancers into the ceiling with Karnesis, the Deathloop spin on Dishonored's Pull ability. Pairing mods sparks any number of possibilities: you could deploy Shift with Aether, aka near-invisibility, to become a perfect ghost, or Karnesis with Havoc, aka berserker mode, to become Darth Vader storming hallways singlehanded. The guns, meanwhile, come in familiar shades but are a treat to wield, thanks not least to some nuanced rumble feedback. Arkane Lyon co-developed Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and you can see that experience in the gleam and heft of Deathloop's firearms, which range from thundering handcannons and pneumatic nailguns to drum-fed shotguns that look like weaponised carousel projectors.Probably Deathloop's biggest disappointment is that all the Slabs have precedents in Dishonored. You could also argue that it doesn't steal enough: some of the Outsider's weirder gifts have been left on the table, like conjuring up spectral assassins or transforming yourself into rats and fish. But what Deathloop lacks in terms of individual tools, it makes up for in terms of freedom to use them. Your power bar recharges, for starters, so you can wield all those intoxicating skills without scraping around for elixirs. You also have more license to screw up thanks to Colt's Reprise slab, a Tracer-style rewinding skill which essentially gives you three stabs at each level before the entire day resets. These tweaks are the mark of a gentler, more playful game, structured to reward improvisation and investigation rather than lock you into the story, which is here conveyed more through backstory documents and charismatically written dialogue than cutscenes. It's not so much an improvement on Arkane's other sims as a change of tune. The Dishonored games insist on a suspenseful friction between breadth of options and severity of consequences: yes, you can dream up killing methods beyond the designers' wildest nightmares, but the soul of a city hangs on your conduct, and while you can replay levels in search of more elegant or inventive solutions, you can't (pre-patching, anyway) fire up any level and mess around as you please. Deathloop, by contrast, is a devil-may-care holiday album of places, periods and layouts that only synchs up into a linear campaign when you want it to. In theory you're at the mercy of the clock, but the time of day only advances when you move between areas, and if you're in a rush, you can always hit fast-forward in the mission lobby. Deathloop's setting doesn't reset completely between deaths. Certain key developments persist. The first is Colt's expanding memory of events, with things like mission objectives and passwords conveniently preserved on your inventory screen (there's an autofill option when using keypads, a vital shortcut in a game with dozens of codes to learn). Once you've killed a particular Visionary and harvested their research, you can also retain weapons, Slabs and trinkets - aka smaller upgrades such as faster aiming or exploding projectiles - between runs by infusing them with \"Residium\" energy gathered from objects in the world. These objects are plentiful, and you can always obtain Residium by recycling items between forays, so amassing an arsenal is much easier than in the average roguelike.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eddfed23-9efd-4ceb-a439-cbdd7d9a4fbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "eddfed23-9efd-4ceb-a439-cbdd7d9a4fbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "f8cf0ae0-c05e-45ef-a6eb-8c2447da96fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1540be4864ba1a79db9866c1423fcdbebc567cb9e880c2b4b0089105f59f2226"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f9cb274-9f46-4d11-9aec-c712175f2c10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aeca2f2008abc52d7b61b1c0babd8d624eb1db59621ff0e756656af75bc2dadd"}}, "hash": "24384e43294c7b9bb7a5f238e03d6b4599c7f99f83621038a0173cd4e9006cde", "text": "I almost never found myself visiting areas simply to scrounge for guns and materials.Slab mods, meanwhile, are obtained by killing the Slab's owner over and over - a brilliant incentive to revisit times and places and improvise afresh using powers and insight gained from the previous murder. It does away with the tedium of XP grinding, while simultaneously spotlighting the DIY ethos for which Arkane is famous. The mods themselves again recall Dishonored, but that doesn't make them any less entertaining. Employ the Shift Slab's self-explanatory Swapper mod to leave a trail of disoriented people in your wake, moving them into the paths of their own grenades, or leaving them to screech confusedly on windowsills. Or you can mod Nexus such that the effect spreads between characters as they pass each other - as stern a lesson on the importance of social distancing as any.There are two halves to Deathloop's story. In the first, you kill the Visionaries one by one and obtain their powers, infiltrating and mastering the eccentricities of lairs that range from Punchdrunk-style live action shooting courses to sprawling castle masquerades. In the second, you exploit your foreknowledge of events and access to hidden locations to bring everybody together, perhaps messing up one Visionary's morning so that they decide to come along to the evening gala. The game's lore and mission menus are startlingly intuitive, given the complexity of all this - there's a daisy chain of clues and leads you can ponder, but all you really need are the brief directions you're given when you select an area.The Visionaries and Eternalists themselves are an army of clown-painted mayflies who can be slaughtered over and over without penalty and remorse. They're also a bunch of extremely inebriated people with minimal training, which helps explain away AI shortcomings like everybody charging heedlessly into your sights, and leads to some amusing combat chatter. \"Hey, it's that one guy!\" one woman slurs a second before you land on her machete first. \"Fine, I guess I'll cover myself then,\" complains one man to his shredded brethren as you circle round his position. It's often worth stopping to watch the Eternalists go about their business, whether they're getting loaded in the bars or taking advantage of their \"amortality\" to kill each other for kicks. While exploring one roof in Updaan, the island's social hub, I stumbled on a woman industriously setting up a line of cereal boxes so as to drop a landmine on somebody's head. Like Hitman - whose influence is also traceable in the modular campaign structure and certain setpiece environment kills - Deathloop's writing and characterisation take square aim at what The Great Gatsby called the \"vast carelessness\" of the super-rich. The Visionaries range from elite scientists to ogreish rockstars and pampered artistes. They resemble classic Bond villains at first, but the dialogue channels that more contemporary blend of sociopathy that sees billionaires trying to reboot humanity on Mars while claiming that we all live in the Matrix. While Deathloop stands out among blockbuster shooters for featuring two Black leads, the social divisions it explores are less about race or for that matter gender or sexual orientation, more about the reality-altering force of hideous quantities of cash. The Visionaries are a diverse bunch, but at the end of the day, they are all one and the same concentration of impossible wealth.For all this, it's possible to view your targets with a certain pity. AEON's disciples might think they've shucked off mortality, but their refuge is a purgatory that's all foreplay without release. One thing you learn early is that only a tiny handful, including Colt and Julianna, retain any awareness of the fact that they've been reliving their \"First Day\" for a while. The majority are caught on the threshold of immortality. They will never know anything beyond anticipation (and hangovers, in many cases - if you're entering a time-loop, it's best not to party too hard the night before). There are scientists who will never build on their breakthroughs, and creatives who will never finish their masterworks. There are characters who are caught forever in abusive relationships, and randos doomed to perform one and the same odd-job for eternity. Julianna and one other individual aside, the only person in a position to actually enjoy the timeloop is Colt. So why, as she continually asks you over the radio, are you in such a hurry to leave?

There are hints of social stealth - the suggestion that you can obtain a disguise to access that evening party incognito, for example - but it doesn't bloom into a full-on mingle 'em up. The Eternalists always know you're coming, which means that they always behave like guards rather than civilians, and as Julianna warns you early on, everybody recognises Colt's trademark leather jacket. It feels like a slight missed opportunity. Given that this is an online game, I'd also have liked to see something like Hitman's Contracts mode, which let you assign a target and killing method for other players to master. \"This might be Arkane's most straightforwardly enjoyable game yet.\"In place of that you get Julianna's side of the game, which recalls Assassin's Creed's long-forgotten PvP multiplayer. Where Colt has his rewind ability, Julianna's Slab lets her swap faces and outfits with any NPC, leaving a clone of herself strolling around while she play-acts as cannon fodder. In practice, I've found that a lot of Juliannas just run towards the loudest noise firing a shotgun, but given an appropriately methodical opponent, Deathloop sings as a cat-and-mouse game. Julianna seals all the map's exits when she invades, obliging Colt to hack a radio tower to escape. As the invader, the obvious approach is to surround the tower with tripwires and landmines, but you might also sic the Eternalist mob on Colt with the D-pad, or lay ambushes along the obvious routes to make your opponent's map knowledge a disadvantage. If all this sounds like a chore, you can always turn off the online, though this means that you'll only get to fight an AI-controlled Julianna once in the game. There's also a limit to how often any given Julianna player can invade you to stop high-level griefers ruining the experience for greener Colts.Appropriately for a game about time travel, Deathloop can be read as a game both for newcomers and old hands - an accessible introduction to Arkane's grittier immersive sims, or a triumphant refinement of the Dishonored style. Where it feels most like a concluding act is in how it builds on a theme in Arkane's work about games as means of both coercion and liberation, trapping you in order to empower and motivate you to break out of them, forever challenging you to think of some possibility that has escaped the developer's calculations, to the point of sabotaging the illusion entirely. I've argued in the past that this contradiction is fundamental to the immersive sim genre, but Arkane is unique in making it a question of story and setting.

Do either of these observations really matter in the grand scheme of things? No, not particularly. Do I feel inclined to raise them all the same? Yes, absolutely. Pedantry is a reaction Arkane Studios must be all too familiar with by now; the developer has thoroughly earned its reputation for building some of the most wondrously detailed and immersive worlds in the modern era. You have no choice but to pick at the occasional loose thread because there is so little to criticise about the larger tapestry.\u00a0Given that I've opened up this review by talking about Blackreef's bathrooms, you can probably see where I'm going with this already: While Deathloop may share some common design ethos with Dishonored and Prey, it's a fundamentally different experience. Arkane establishes this early, with the first locked door you encounter. I do it almost on instinct, punching 0451 into the keypad and expecting it to swing open. Instead, I'm met with a blinking red light as Captain Colt Vahn growls something about 'old habits dying hard' \u2013 a PlayStation Trophy pops, a consolation prize for the infamous immersive sim cheat code not working on Blackreef either.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af34f9a4-96e6-4892-bbb1-16aeedf597d7": {"__data__": {"id_": "af34f9a4-96e6-4892-bbb1-16aeedf597d7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d8416d7-4680-4881-823d-9da19528b4c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f42af7a788be7534c7bdb5601726bbb36caebc4e14d5fc864ebb49cba4149bf4"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e9c6a4b-488e-48be-8123-13805e1dcf44", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e08f796cad084d7f86085c8298de63ac6cf0ade1d2f8e92411424d763e9f7e5c"}}, "hash": "b0a3e5e21998bfb5b496e5e367796091e6b5fc20226031d31b7bfe20b070d27d", "text": "I'll promise you this, you've never played an Arkane game quite like Deathloop before.\u00a0Release Date: September 14, 2021\nPlatform(s): PS5, PC\nDeveloper: Arkane Studios\nPublisher: BethesdaArkane sets its worlds apart by targeting coherence. Dunwall and Karnaca were high-concept, heavily industrialized cities peering off the edge of the world, but they felt lived-in \u2013 as if they were real places that Corvo Attano and Emily Kaldwin were actively disrupting. While working to secure Talos I, it seemed as if Morgan Yu really was rooting through a space station suspended in the past, a scientific experiment gone awry recounted one room at a time. Arkane didn't build these intricate environments just to impress, it did so to tell a layered narrative, and to immerse you in a specific place and time. Every object in an Arkane world is there for a reason. It's this characteristic of coherence that helped make Dishonored and Prey special.It's exciting then to see the studio try something different with Deathloop. Blackreef might be Arkane's most artificial world yet. Your main point of interaction with its patchwork of spaces is through the barrels of some beautifully rendered weaponry. What we have in Blackreef is four creative, finely-crafted sets \u00a0\u2013 each dressed to be seen during four periods of a single day \u2013 that are both self-contained and persistently tracking progress in what will at times feel like an impossible task: to assassinate eight targets in a single day, or die trying.\u00a0And you're going to die. Truth be told, you're going to die a lot. And I promise that you're going to enjoy it. You'll be shot, stabbed, and sent tumbling down cliff faces, splashing into the frigid waters that surround this island suspended in time. You'll choke, drown, be set on fire, and ground up into meat paste as you stalk rooftops in the morning, noon, afternoon, and night. As a reward for exploring enough to uncover a path less travelled, maybe you'll accidentally trap yourself in a depressurization chamber, or have your molecules obliterated by an unstable reactor. Death isn't to be feared in Deathloop, but embraced.\u00a0Dying is an opportunity to learn something new. About the layout of Blackreef's four districts, the eight Visionaries that must be assassinated, and the hordes of Eternalists that are hell bent on preventing it all from crashing down around them. Deathloop is less concerned about delivering a coherent lived-in world, with Arkane focusing its energy instead on building something that is consistent. That is key, because consistency allows you to internalize enemy placements and begin to use them to your advantage. Gradually, you'll discover how to retain your favorite weapons and awesome supernatural powers, even after dying. You'll work out where the Visionaries reside, the fastest routes to confront them, and, eventually, ways to encourage multiple targets to reside in a single location. The steady acquisition of knowledge is a more powerful weapon than any gun or power in Deathloop.And it's all a lot of fun. When I said before that Blackreef felt artificial, that isn't necessarily a criticism. Deathloop has a different agenda to Dishonored and Prey. Blackreef is less a playground and more of a smartly-designed hedge maze; there's only one exit and, every time that you die, you're put back at the entrance; the story it wants to convey is one of escape and everything you do is in service of that.\u00a0What Arkane has built here in Deathloop is a multifaceted puzzle box. Blackreef doesn't feel fleshed out in the way Dunwall and Karnaca did. No matter how much reading of discarded notes you do, you won't get a real sense of why hundreds of masked Eternalists flocked to the island to escape the passage of time, why the Visionaries invested so much of themselves in preserving the loop, or how any of them live their lives in Deathloop's four dreamy technicolor districts. The people of Blackreef exist to die. To be whipped out of windows with telekinesis. To have their necks snapped over, and over, and over again. To stand rooted in place as you storm toward them with an SMG that heals you gripped in one hand and a hand-cannon that fires explosive rounds in the other. Deathloop doesn't excel as an out-and-out shooter, its turning circle and aim assist can feel sluggish in a way that Wolfenstein doesn't, for example \u2013 a series the studio has collaborated with MachineGames on in the past.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e9c6a4b-488e-48be-8123-13805e1dcf44": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e9c6a4b-488e-48be-8123-13805e1dcf44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "af34f9a4-96e6-4892-bbb1-16aeedf597d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0a3e5e21998bfb5b496e5e367796091e6b5fc20226031d31b7bfe20b070d27d"}, "3": {"node_id": "4b8ad9f4-59eb-4cc6-89cc-388532378212", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "964a40830076edbe4b48144407354794d1e22968c4c45f72adda2c94616fa83e"}}, "hash": "e08f796cad084d7f86085c8298de63ac6cf0ade1d2f8e92411424d763e9f7e5c", "text": "But it sure is a hell of a good time to shoot a lot of people all the same. \u00a0Deathloop isn't the first game to attempt a puzzle box in this new generation. IO Interactive's Hitman 3 arrived earlier this year and the difference between the two couldn't be more stark \u2013 both in terms of their visual aesthetic and style of play they encourage. If anything, the experience of playing Deathloop is the inverse of how you're traditionally pushed through something like a Hitman 3. IO designed a complexity curve that is narrow to begin with and gradually widens as you familiarise yourself with its overlapping systems, mechanics, and layouts. Its 'mission stories' can help even the most confused killers execute the most spectacular assassinations, steering players with waypoints and contextual clues through every step of the process. As you become more comfortable, IO gradually takes its hands off of your shoulders, leaving you to your own devices inside some truly stunning sandboxes.\u00a0Deathloop does the opposite. Arkane uses the opening hours to outline the big concept. To point to where each of the Visionaries initially reside and to teach you the basics of death, respawning, equipping weapons, and altering their utility with supernatural Trinkets. And then Arkane walks away, throwing you into Blackreef to be guided by little more than the occasional mission marker and your inherent desire to experiment. The first 15 hours of Deathloop are among its most entertaining, as you push against the world just to see how hard it will shove you back.\u00a0\"The experience of playing Deathloop is the inverse of how you're traditionally pushed through something like a Hitman 3\"Eventually, Deathloop begins to contort. As you begin taking Visionaries down, collecting their unique weapons and Slabs \u2013 supernatural abilities, not bestowed upon you by An Outsider, but made by a few dozen annoying scientists in a laboratory \u2013 and discovering key information on how to break the cycle, the complexity curve begins to narrow and the scope of play with it. There's only one way to set the dominos and only one way to have them fall. Once you work out an element that's critical to breaking the loop, Deathloop celebrates it with an animated cutscene just to punctuate the point: you may have nothing but time, but it's time to stop wasting it.In a sense then, Deathloop gets more linear as time goes on, until you're essentially speedrunning toward a cycle of murder that can topple all eight of the Visionaries. You stop utilizing non-essential locked passageways, hidden hideaways, and the verticality of the maps, as you may have done in the early hours, and begin to focus your attention on efficiency. Deathloop ceases to hint at new opportunities and starts offering solutions outright, with mission markers and menu indicators working to keep you on track. It's a fascinating twist, one that keeps Deathloop feeling fresh and focused all throughout its generous runtime. If I were to give you any advice, it would be not to rush toward the final objective; taking time to explore, discovering ways to streamline your runs through each area and time zone, is a good time worth savoring. The longer you can hold off on assembling the pieces of the puzzle, the better a time you'll have with Deathloop.\u00a0Even with Deathloop's focus narrowing over time, there is one element of randomization that will have a minor impact on your runs and that's Julianna \u2013 a small inconsistency in a game otherwise defined by its predictable patterns. Whether the rival assassin is controlled by AI or by another real player \u2013 whereby somebody across the world boots up Deathloop, chooses violence, and decides to invade your game from the menu \u2013 it's a nice touch that can very quickly increase the tension in your fingers, something the Eternalists and Visionaries eventually lose the ability to do. Listen, once you're able to clear all of Fristad Rock with little more than a pressurized nail gun and an intimate knowledge of both enemy and trap placement, Deathloop's pervading sense of challenge can begin to dissipate.\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Deathloop. It wasn't what I thought it was going to be and it seemed to challenge my expectations without reservation. It's a murder mystery that's suspended in a time loop. It's a first-person shooter that features a shotgun that can transform into a rifle. It's a sci-fi spy adventure that's stuck in the '70s. It's all of these things and none of them at all. My impression of Deathloop seemed to shift with every passing hour and, as a result, it's difficult to not be impressed \u2013 if not thoroughly enthralled \u2013 with what Arkane has pieced together here.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, The makers of Dishonored and Prey create a Groundhog Day style adventure where you have to escape reliving the same day again and again.Although it was a PlayStation 5 and PC timed exclusive at launch Dishonored is now also available on Xbox Series X/S, and because Microsoft now owns publisher Bethesda it\u2019s also on Game Pass. It\u2019s exactly the same game as before, although an update including an extended ending is coming to all formats as a free update.It\u2019s not hard to imagine the game Arkane Studios must\u2019ve envisioned when they first started work on Deathloop, and the unavoidable compromises they had to make in order to turn it into a mainstream game. Publisher Bethesda has tried their best, but this is a difficult game to explain unless you actually play it and it\u2019s almost certainly not what you think it\u2019s going to be (which, ironically, means it would\u2019ve been perfect for Game Pass, except it\u2019s a timed PlayStation 5 console exclusive \u2013 one of the last deals Bethesda made before being acquired by Microsoft).Deathloop is part of a proud tradition of video games which involve time travel, not just as a passing plot point but a key element of the gameplay. It\u2019s essentially the inverse of The Sexy Brutale, which was a non-action game about saving the lives of mask wearing people at a decadent party. In Deathloop you\u2019re trying to kill seven key targets at once in order to destabilise a time loop that otherwise keeps you replaying the same day forever.With only a few exceptions, everyone restarts the loop with their memories wiped and as the game begins so do you, as you wake up on the beach of a small island in the Arctic Circle. The island was formerly a fishing community with a (not very) secret army base conducting experiments into a space-time anomaly. It\u2019s now owned by a private company run by a collection of obnoxious and deeply immoral scientists and businesspeople and it\u2019s they who have set the time loop in motion.Given Arkane\u2019s previous work on the Dishonored series and the reboot of Prey you\u2019d assume that this was a similar style of first person action adventure (we do so hate the meaningless term \u2018immersive sim\u2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "289903b2-e4bc-4d51-a641-69c5a88ebbba": {"__data__": {"id_": "289903b2-e4bc-4d51-a641-69c5a88ebbba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "4b8ad9f4-59eb-4cc6-89cc-388532378212", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "964a40830076edbe4b48144407354794d1e22968c4c45f72adda2c94616fa83e"}, "3": {"node_id": "2dae0055-0be0-4067-bf3d-121733fadc1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "beaeec8420f19caa274a8341ac1c9c5754ef2c44d3db436906ca630002832cdd"}}, "hash": "df9a642375bc1805e8598a839450efe92f547f4819b110589dfcb2e5338942cc", "text": "It does have elements of both games, including a couple of magic abilities borrowed directly from Dishonored, but while Deathloop still has a heavy focus on stealth it\u2019s much more of an action game than either of its predecessors, and with good reason as the gunplay is excellent and highly satisfying.The key difference with something like Prey is that Deathloop provides much clearer instructions on how to progress, to the point where the only thing you have to work out yourself is the combat tactics. Your goal is to get all seven targets in the right place at the right time, so you can kill them in one loop, but rather than that being something you have to puzzle out as a player the game explains each step in detail, which is further simplified by splitting the loop up into four sections: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening.The island is also divided into four separate open world areas, so each day you have to make a choice of which one to visit and when. There\u2019s no time limit within an area and you can leave whenever you like, but doing so automatically advances you onto the next time period, before looping back round. The basic map is the same whatever time of day it is but things do change, including your targets being present or not and things like buildings getting set on fire.As well as a variety of firearms, which often have unique buffs or abilities, you also have special powers gifted by the anomaly. You start off with one which grants you two extra lives, rewinding time a few seconds every time you die \u2013 with the final death resetting the loop to the morning. Others are gained by killing one of your targets and stealing theirs, which range from partial invisibility to a limited form of telekinesis and being able to link up enemies so any damage done to one is felt by all.Ordinarily you don\u2019t get to keep anything between loops, much like a roguelike, but you can collect a substance called Residuum which can be spent to retain a weapon or buff, which come as loot drops called trinkets. The problem with this is that it\u2019s very easy to quickly obtain an arsenal of highly effective weapons, such that collecting more is entirely unnecessary after just a few hours.Deathloop may have one of the most poorly balanced armouries of any first person shooter, especially if you play stealthily. Only a few hours in you get hold of a submachinegun with a suppressor that is, inexplicably, able to instakill enemies with headshots at any distance, without anyone hearing. This not only makes the actual sniper rifles, which make a noise, redundant but almost every other weapon too, bar maybe an automatic shotgun for close-up work.Using the magic submachinegun in conjunction with invisibility and the Nexus linking ability, Deathloop \u2013 which has no difficulty options \u2013 soon becomes trivially easy. Those headshots never stop being satisfying but because the game always makes it so clear what you need to do next there\u2019s rarely any obvious need or benefit in taking a different route or figuring out a unique solution to elminating down a target or group of enemies.A similar problem spoils the alternative game mode where you get to play as Julianna, the eighth target who, unlike the others, has a personal connection with main player character Colt and constantly taunts him over the radio. You can\u2019t deal with her permanently until the very end of the game, but she will often invade an area and has the ability to disguise herself as an ordinary grunt (there is effectively only one enemy type). You\u2019re warned when she arrives but otherwise she could pop out of anywhere.If you choose to play as Julianna then you get to invade someone else\u2019s game and are able to level her up by completing in-game achievements. And yet the gun she starts with, an explosive long range rifle, is so useful there\u2019s rarely any need to use anything else. Especially once you start getting flooded with trinkets every time you level up. It\u2019s not that playing as her is super easy but more so that poor weapon balancing discourages you from experimenting.Once you\u2019re in an area there\u2019s no time limit but there\u2019s also no schedule to keep up with. Unlike Zelda: Majora\u2019s Mask you don\u2019t see people walking about, going about their business, even though the layout of an area has often changed because of actions (some caused by you) earlier in the day.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2dae0055-0be0-4067-bf3d-121733fadc1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2dae0055-0be0-4067-bf3d-121733fadc1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "289903b2-e4bc-4d51-a641-69c5a88ebbba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "df9a642375bc1805e8598a839450efe92f547f4819b110589dfcb2e5338942cc"}, "3": {"node_id": "87736d70-6b7a-4f48-a253-6ed74e7b3d8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f7e841f29344a5601e0ecd9e8506b8f5b929e873800fddfde7cbe59fae31640f"}}, "hash": "beaeec8420f19caa274a8341ac1c9c5754ef2c44d3db436906ca630002832cdd", "text": "This means that there\u2019s never any chance of missing an opportunity because you were too late, but it also means the game feels off-puttingly sterile and empty, as while it\u2019s always filled with people you can\u2019t interact with any of them except down the barrel of a gun.Eavesdropping on guards as they talk is often vital to your progress, especially discovering side quests, but since everyone wears masks \u2013 often making them look like animated shop mannequins \u2013 they never really feel human, despite some fun dialogue. The masks were probably to prevent the game from being too disturbingly violent but surely the sensible option would\u2019ve been to just have less gory kill animations.Speaking of odd design decisions, the game is set in an alternate history version of the 60s and for absolutely no obvious reason. The art design is extrapolated so far out from reality that it could easily have been its own thing, especially as everyone talks like glib YouTubers \u2013 not someone born during the Second World War.The way the self-proclaimed \u2018Eternalists\u2019 are portrayed also lacks bite, with the game implying that the reason the loop was created was so they can enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle free of consequences. But because this is a video game there\u2019s no sex, only oblique references to drugs, and just very occasional drunkenness. Frankly, it\u2019s a mystery why anyone thinks the time loop is a good idea, especially the ordinary cannon fodder who have to spend eternity on guard duty in the freezing cold.Colt is fun but he\u2019s played a little too broadly and it\u2019s his nemesis Julianna who becomes the standout character of the game. The vocal performance by Ozioma Akagha is superb and gets across her complicated personality perfectly, as her taunts switch from pure hatred to sad disappointment and obvious affection in the same breath. Which makes it all the more tragic that, after an unexpected mid-game revelation, her character, and the rest of the story, end up going nowhere thanks to a highly underwhelming ending.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationGiven all its problems it feels like something of miracle that Deathloop is as entertaining as it is, but the intriguing premise and enjoyable action keeps you playing despite the many issues. Although it becomes obvious that there\u2019s a lot less depth to the game than initially implied, with little in the way of real puzzles and most of your time out of combat spent reading notes and listening to audio logs, with the game explaining every step needed in such detail that you never really have to work anything out for yourself.An indie game like The Sexy Brutale can afford to give up accessibility in favour of the sort of freeform exploration and problem solving that we assume Arkane was originally going for in Deathloop. Little of that has made it into the final game though and while what\u2019s left is still very entertaining it\u2019s unlikely to have you looping back for more after your first playthrough.In Short: Not quite a misfire but while the action is highly entertaining this time-looping adventure squanders much of its premise on disappointingly straightforward objectives and a curiously tame portrayal of unchecked hedonism.Pros: Excellent gunplay and some fun magic abilities. Intriguing premise and the first half of the game, at least, is well paced and unpredictable. Julianna is so good she needs her own spin-off.Cons: Terrible weapon balancing and little need for experimentation given how clear the game makes your objectives. Far too easy and with a story that ultimately goes nowhere.Score: 7/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed) and PCPrice: \u00a359.99Publisher: BethesdaDeveloper: Arkane LyonRelease Date: 14th September 2021Age Rating: 18Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : QuakeCon 2021: Deathloop panel finally explains Julianna and PvP mode\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Deathloop PS5 console exclusivity ends September 2022\n\n\n\n\tMORE : Why Deathloop could be the best Bethesda game since Dishonored\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.ukFor more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGame Informer, Deathloop is a paradox, where time is in both infinite supply and quickly running out.

Paradoxically, this feat is an intricate clockwork of planning, preparation, and execution that feels impossible at first. It all culminates in one of Arkane Studios' best games to date.Deathloop begins in media res, as Colt is murdered by a mysterious woman named Julianna Blake. As soon as he dies, he wakes up on a strange beach with no knowledge of who he is or how he got there. Julianna soon makes contact, explaining his situation, and by extension, the game's rules. Colt is on Blackreef, where time is perpetually stuck, and murder is the only way out.The game revels in its nihilistic world; dying has no meaning on Blackreef, so why not do whatever you want? Death, murder, and all manner of awful things are treated casually, lending dark humor to the whole experience. This kind of storytelling could have become juvenile in the wrong hands, but Deathloop's writing is strong, and I enjoyed seeing the twisted ways it played with the timeloop conceit. Colt and Julianna's interactions \u2013 full of bickering and arguments \u2013 are almost always entertaining and humorous, and the two are now among my favorite video game characters of the year.Blackreef is broken into four large districts, each with its own clues on how to proceed, access to targets, and storylines that progress the main plot or serve as side content. Each district has a unique flair\u00a0\u2013 from a city center hosting a massive party to an expansive research station near the coast \u2013 and arriving at different times of day changes everything from where guards patrol to who and what is available. You can choose to explore a district at four times of day: morning, noon, afternoon, or evening, and I enjoy the way this makes you plan your routes accordingly.Tracking leads throughout Blackreef quickly became my favorite part of Deathloop. I loved exploring, seeing how the world opens up and how my opportunities change over the course of a day. It takes a while to get to the bottom of any mystery in Deathloop, but the game does a good job of paying you back for your time with fun new ways to play, such as access to new powers, better weapons, and upgrades for both.Compared to Arkane's previous immersive sim series, Dishonored, Deathloop encourages players to spill as much blood as they want; no penalty or morality system is punishing you for using all the cool weapons and powers at your disposal. Many of those powers are very similar to those in Dishonored, including teleporting around levels and chaining multiple enemies together so that killing one kills everyone in the chain. From the get-go, these powers seem like upgraded versions of those in Dishonored, meaning Deathloop is effectively one giant power trip. As I honed my skills and memorized its various levels, I loved loading in and ripping through an environment in a matter of minutes \u2013 especially when combined with the game's great arsenal, which includes a nail gun for silent headshots and an SMG that can be reloaded while shooting for a non-stop bullet spray. An in-game currency allows weapons, powers, and upgrades to be carried between loops, which is a helpful touch for alleviating the penalties of death.The last trick up Deathloop's sleeve is its online component, which pits players against each other. Where the single player focuses on Colt, players can also jump into a mode where they play as Julianna. The former tries to achieve their objective as the latter invades other players' games and attempts to hunt them down and kill them. This mechanic can be turned off, but I found that these invasions add a fun bit of tension and spontaneity to runs, especially when playing with a friend I could talk and laugh with. My best-laid plans were useless when Julianna showed up, and the dangerous game of cat and mouse that ensued always left me on edge.The further I got, the more satisfying it became putting all the various puzzle pieces together until finally, I had a finished plan. I had built dozens of routes to get through my final day, assembled an arsenal of perfect weapons, and chosen the right powers to kill all my targets. And then I botched it all at the last second. But that ever-building sense of knowledge and accomplishment present throughout the game led me to immediately start a new playthrough, to experiment further and explore. In Deathloop, dying is fun, killing is even better, and I can't wait to see what the game throws at me next.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

If time is the great consumer, then those that control time control the universe. It is no wonder, then, that the villains of Deathloop have decided to seize time for themselves. Arkane Lyon\u2019s latest sandbox adventure deploys a time mechanic like no other game. The studio has created the equivalent of a finely tuned watch. And it\u2019s truly one of the most incredible video game experiences of my life. Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.Deathloop is a first-person time-looping murder/puzzle game where time has become both meaningless and everything. Player character Colt wakes up, with no memory, on the beach of a strange island. The island is experiencing one day on repeat, with everyone \u2014 except Colt (and another character) \u2014 performing the same actions. Colt wants to break this cycle and escape.The island is controlled by eight rich, murderous assholes called Visionaries. Colt must assassinate all eight before the end of the day to break the loop. The Visionaries are spread out over four distinct sandbox districts and four time periods. Moving from one district to another moves the day forward. However, while Colt is in one district, time stands still. I can take all the time I want to explore \u2014 which is essential for the deeply fascinating, complex and carefully crafted level design Arkane is known for. Added to this is Julianna, a young woman determined to taunt and murder and also encourage Colt. Like Colt, she remembers previous loops. And she can appear at almost any time to ruin Colt\u2019s plans. The most important part is that she can be controlled by other players, who can also upgrade her along a completely separate progression path. I was not able to test this out fully, given how few people were playing during the review period (and I also had severe lag while playing on PlayStation 5). But the few moments where it worked were amazing. Playing as, essentially, the villain transforms the entire experience, and it\u2019s a genius bit of design. I look forward to experiencing it fully now that more people are playing. \n    Related\n  The relationship between Colt and Julianna is the heart of this game, and the performances by Jason E. Kelley and Ozioma Akagha, respectively, are astounding. It\u2019s also important to note that both playable characters are Black, which is cause for celebration when there is a dearth of Black people being represented as leads in big-budget media (and in particular, a lack of Black characters who aren\u2019t gang members or criminals). Furthermore, Colt is a bit of a weirdo and a surprising lead: He sometimes bursts into song, he enjoys murdering, and he is terrible at telling jokes. He\u2019s your friend\u2019s weird dad. Even when Julianna is threatening him, he doesn\u2019t have the heart to be mean to her. It\u2019s surprising and delightful that most of Deathloop is intelligence gathering, not assassinating. After all, when there are still four Visionaries left at the end of the day, Colt has not broken the loop. In other words: Deathloop is Edge of Tomorrow meets Hitman. Colt obtains access to multiple upgradeable weapons. While some of these are standard fare \u2014 pistols, SMGs, rifles \u2014 some legendary variants are notable. My favorite is a pair of pistols that can be stacked together like two giant Lego bricks to form a rifle.As is tradition with Arkane\u2019s games, Colt also has access to otherworldly powers. Shift allows Colt to phase through a large gap instantly (it\u2019s basically the Blink ability from Dishonored); another allows Colt to link multiple enemies such that killing one kills them all (similar to Domino in Dishonored 2). Mixing the powers and weapons often leads to incredible moments. For example, after I located two Visionaries surrounded by their minions, I used my link ability to tie both targets to one isolated guard. Killing him meant I took both down instantly.With hacking tools available and multiple entryways to each building, Deathloop is more than welcoming to stealthier players.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "756050ce-c3a2-404c-897a-f5fcd20e2839": {"__data__": {"id_": "756050ce-c3a2-404c-897a-f5fcd20e2839", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "3382a958-a9e2-4648-84b2-3ad7e5fba7ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "844270808f187e153e477cd654f768dca6eede862b0d490d95a29c8bf350cbde"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb7e1826-787f-4535-abf7-7bc75cb01afc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d022bb291f35cb8f204224edd90906d09c80deb8fd16af78d71992670a63a0a"}}, "hash": "c1cbdec48033d3ab5583f1380b8835fcd6b6e06276faae3217359a0afc0e42a2", "text": "But this is the first Arkane game that feels wonderful as an all-out action shooter, too. In fact, an Arkane game has never felt this good. I didn\u2019t feel punished for breaking a stealth approach, and some magic powers even encourage it. Colt can toss people into the air; he can go berserk and become supernaturally strong. \n    Related\n  Part of what makes the game feel so smooth is that the studio also has fully embraced the PS5\u2019s DualSense controller. Every gun feels unique; every power has its own sensation. Colt\u2019s footsteps perfectly sync with the rumble on either side. It\u2019s an incredibly tactile experience. In terms of aesthetics, Deathloop has a quirky, albeit derelict, 1960s spy theme. Think No One Lives Forever, but covered in decay. One district is essentially an amusement park, while another is graced by snow and a giant, pulsating satellite array. None of this is to mention how the locales shift throughout the day: A car that was idle in the morning has crashed through some windows by the afternoon; a ship in open water is reachable later when ice has formed. Despite this being a game about repetition, no interior or exterior location feels recycled.One would expect moving from one level to the next to be seamless on a new-generation console, but unfortunately, the game has to log into its servers each time. It only takes a few seconds, but it\u2019s undoubtedly a blow to the slick momentum elsewhere. Such is the price for an innovative multiplayer mode, I guess.Another issue is the game\u2019s strange reluctance to let me track information properly or on my own. Colt has a murder board, but it only gives me step-by-step tasks, not broad information Colt obviously knows. The pre-mission planning menus are clunky, making it hard to know where specific information is or even if it can be tracked. I found it easier to make my own notes.What\u2019s more, I had imagined the game would require me to plot the eventual perfect murder day (i.e., to kill all the targets before the end of the day). But Deathloop itself puts all the information together and sets out the path. I understand how this might prevent frustration for players who aren\u2019t diligent note takers. But it mitigated my sense of satisfaction after paying attention every step of the way. Deathloop is a strange but wondrous beast. It\u2019s a time-management game where I built a precision murder machine to effect a carefully plotted rampage. It\u2019s also a story about a man finding out who he is and why he\u2019s being hunted by a young woman who knows everything about him. Time is Colt\u2019s prison, yet also the source of his power. But it felt liberating to break free entirely, to have executed such quiet devastation. By the end, I was left in awe at the precision of Deathloop\u2019s focus, the liberty and respect afforded to me as a player, and the minimization \u2014 though not complete removal \u2014 of frustration in a game entirely centered around repetition. The success with which Arkane pulled this all off is a testament to the studio\u2019s incredible talent and intelligence. No other studio makes you feel quite so smart, and no game of theirs has done it better. Deathloop was released Sept. 14 on Windows PC and PlayStation 5.

I tried to be true to myself--skulking across rooftops, hiding in dark corners, and carefully moving between people, but the allure of Blackreef's daily absolution was difficult to resist. I watched the first Eternalist I killed dissolve into nothingness, and a message written into the air in some ethereal ink assured me he'd return in the next loop, completely oblivious to what happened. Killing became second nature, and with no consequence why wouldn't it?You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Deathloop Video ReviewThe rules of Deathloop's world created an intoxicating sense of liberation, but this leads to the game's central question of purpose: When nothing matters, how do you give your actions meaning? That is where developer Arkane Lyon's gameplay design comes into play, and killing with reckless abandon becomes killing for a reason: to break the loop. The mechanics that govern the world and facilitate your quest to upend it are constructed so masterfully that there's a tangible sense of growth both in-game and out of it. You begin your first day in Blackreef dazed, confused, and incredibly hungover, and end your final one as the unstoppable architect of its demise.But what's most impressive about Deathloop is that it's also an introspective game. It's Arkane deconstructing its own brand of open-ended action and laying bare all the pieces crucial to it. The systems are presented as digestible on an individual level, but then the game subtly pushes you to put the pieces together so you can truly appreciate how the clockwork world ticks, before bringing a swift fist crashing down on it. Deathloop is a game where observation and dynamic thinking go hand-in-hand with shotgunning goons in the face and snapping their necks; where throwing a grenade into a soiree for sycophants counts as the right kind of experimentation and derring-do. It delivers bombastic thrills and wince-inducing kills with intelligence and elegance in equal measure.At the heart of the game is Colt Vahn, a man simultaneously adrift in time and stuck within it. He wakes up on a beach with no memory of how he got there or what's really going on. However, what distinguishes him from the other hedonistic denizens of Blackreef is that he is able to retain his memories between loops. Dying will force him into a new loop, but the knowledge he has accrued up until his death will return with him. And very soon, he discovers that a strange element called Residuum can be harnessed to give his arsenal of weaponry and supernatural abilities permanence too.Like Arkane Lyon's Dishonored games, Deathloop is a fascinating mashup of styles and vibes, both narratively and aesthetically. Underpinning the world is a kind of retro-future science that, as oxymoronic as it sounds, is incredibly effective at giving the world texture--think time travel by way of 1960s computers that fill a room and look like they have less power than an original iPhone. Complementing that is an element of the supernatural that is essentially time science harnessed by a genius mind to give a chosen few the ability to do things like teleport, link the fates of people together, become almost invisible to the naked eye, or throw objects around an environment with a wave of the hand. These abilities are bestowed to the Visionaries, an eclectic group of elites that the rank and file are sworn to protect so that their life of indulgence can remain eternal. Colt's goal is to kill these Visionaries and, in doing so, break the time loop that keeps him trapped there. The rub is that it needs to be done in one day--a single loop.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "140d2095-5f3c-40c3-a07a-789157ea23db": {"__data__": {"id_": "140d2095-5f3c-40c3-a07a-789157ea23db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb7e1826-787f-4535-abf7-7bc75cb01afc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9d022bb291f35cb8f204224edd90906d09c80deb8fd16af78d71992670a63a0a"}, "3": {"node_id": "81c1ea44-647b-4a69-a696-f4840f1c2d43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c599cf8afe8cb039453b491be1c56897a6ba97de391cb9bc8a110ee46e6705f5"}}, "hash": "91e3861870d67853ba6abdaa70ee085817eecdc45ebe1823c90ee35411dd8be6", "text": "The rub is that it needs to be done in one day--a single loop. Easier said than done given that the game operates on a day and night cycle where, over the course of the loop, each Visionary has their own routine and life to lead.Complicating matters further is the fact that the Visionaries know Colt is out to get them and, in fact, all of them have some sort of pre-existing relationship with him. One in particular, Julianna, takes it upon herself to be a thorn in Colt's side. She serves the role of antagonist but the situation is clearly complicated between them. Their interpersonal dynamic is placed front and center to drive much of the narrative and characterization, and both characters are realized exceptionally well.Julianna is the voice in Colt's ear and also over Blackreef's loudspeakers, and she does her damndest to get under his skin. She picks at him in a way that only someone with a deep personal connection to you can, using insight into his personality and history to constantly undermine him and poke at his neuroses. She's always one step ahead, exposing Colt's habits, analyzing his behaviors, and revealing truths about Colt that, because of his initial amnesia, he's yet to realize himself. And yet, there's also a sweetness to their interactions at times, like a couple in the heat of an argument remembering for just a moment why they care about each other. She's a confusing presence, in one breath chastising him for his actions and in another encouraging them. She guides him to objectives and then lays the guilt on thick when he achieves them.In a very real sense, she's a pure agent of chaos and her motivations remain unclear until just the right moment. The voice acting is absolutely crucial to selling this relationship and in that regard, it is achieved exceptionally well thanks to the outstanding delivery by Jason E. Kelley and Ozioma Akagha as Colt and Julianna respectively. Some lines from Julianna have a mischievous tone while others are tinged with spite and growing frustration. For his part, Colt begins unsure of himself and unclear of why this woman has it in for him, but as he learns more, he becomes confident, choosing to engage in the verbal jousts and starting getting under her skin. The constant back and forths between the two is genuinely a joy to listen to and the writing is sharp to make the development of their relationship feel natural.The main focus of Colt's attention, however, is the aforementioned Visionaries who need to be offed, and this is where Deathloop's open-ended gameplay does the heavy lifting. Blackreef is split up into multiple districts, and each one is usually home to at least one of the Visionaries. Colt's objective is to enter an area and figure out how to get himself into a position where he can kill said Visionary and take their Slab, an item that gives them one of the six unique supernatural abilities. But it's not as simple as running into a building and gunning them down as each of the Visionaries is\u2026 a weirdo. Charlie, for example, has transformed a part of Updaam into a low-budget escape room made up of multiple themed floors, complete with puzzles and a whole lot of weapon-wielding Eternalists standing between the entrance and him. Harriet has taken up residence in a Karl's Bay hanger, where she's hosting a group wellness session that is as sinister as it sounds. Wenjie is a super smart scientist who is responsible for harnessing the strange energy of the time loop to create the slabs and rarely leaves her lab in The Complex, but you might find yourself facing an existential conundrum when you're face to face with her.Deathloop is a game where observation and dynamic thinking go hand-in-hand with shotgunning goons in the face and snapping their necks ... it delivers bombastic thrills and wince-inducing kills with intelligence and elegance in equal measureDeathloop's day-and-night cycle also means that these Visionaries are only available at certain times of the day. Although you can manually progress time to your needs, there's only ever a specific window of opportunity to kill a Visionary. That means you need to play through time loops repeatedly, puzzling out a plan to execute it when the time is right. The game makes this more manageable by giving the player Visionary Leads to follow. These are quest chains that guide the player to key pieces of information necessary to pull off the assassination and will often take Colt through different environments at different times of the day.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81c1ea44-647b-4a69-a696-f4840f1c2d43": {"__data__": {"id_": "81c1ea44-647b-4a69-a696-f4840f1c2d43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "140d2095-5f3c-40c3-a07a-789157ea23db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "91e3861870d67853ba6abdaa70ee085817eecdc45ebe1823c90ee35411dd8be6"}, "3": {"node_id": "8722dd6a-3203-4f22-b168-18694dc4d76a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "10eb2f28a26d26278215f7ee6e0995e26670db9436762fd78d401f2f9ea9022a"}}, "hash": "c599cf8afe8cb039453b491be1c56897a6ba97de391cb9bc8a110ee46e6705f5", "text": "You may need the code to a door in Fristad Rock, for example, but a ledger with that information is being stored in an office elsewhere that can only be accessed when a worker leaves the door open in the afternoon.The result of this approach is that you're slowly trained to develop a meticulous understanding of each area in the game. And as your Colt grows in strength and capabilities, so too does your proficiency in navigating them. After killing a Visionary you gain a power, which can be used in the following time loops, provided you invest in it. This growth comes by way of Residuum that can be extracted from charged objects in the environment or, in more abundance, from the dead body of a Visionary. By channeling this resource into weapons and items, you're able to hold onto them between loops. Slab powers are the most essential as they give you a significant ability, and killing a Visionary repeatedly to take their slab will evolve the power. The Shift power, for example, lets you teleport much like Dishonored's Blink. But by repeatedly killing the Visionary wielding it and collecting it, you're able to upgrade the power to let you travel further or hover in the air briefly. Aether lets you turn invisible but becomes more effective if you upgrade it so its effect doesn't wear off when you attack.Along with powers, Trinkets are also littered throughout the world and come in two flavors. Weapon trinkets can be used to augment your combat abilities by improving stats like range, power, and aim-down-sights speed. Personal trinkets, meanwhile, enhance Colt's performance by improving health regeneration, decreasing the amount of noise he makes when moving, or adjusting how his power meter depletes and recovers, among other things. And these all come in multiple color-coded tiers of effectiveness. The presence of these is what makes each time loop consistently rewarding to play through, even if you fail to achieve a bigger objective. Sometimes it can be good to do a run through an area or even an entire loop to build your Residuum balance and collect some more trinkets, especially since it's also an opportunity to refine your chosen playstyle a bit more. There's nothing quite like deciding to run into an area with your guns blazing just so you can chew through Eternalists and a Visionary, knowing that you're doing it just to grab resources. Since Colt is able to come back from death twice, there is a degree of forgiveness in the game that really encourages doing wacky things when the opportunity arises. That third death will reset the loop entirely though, so some strategy is also required if you want to make the most of your time.Very quickly, you'll find yourself developing a level of mastery over the world thanks to the powers and weapons that you've accumulated. A Visionary kill that initially took 20 minutes can be reduced to just a couple as you dart around environments, stealthing through one group of enemies, while laying siege to another, and ultimately cutting through your target before they've even realized what's happening. The repetition-based design of Deathloop eases you into creating a flow state that you can enter into and exit from at will. With the character development systems, it gamifies trial and error so effectively that failures almost always still feel like small triumphs. This might sound typical, given the prominence of recent roguelite games such as Hades, but Deathloop's gameplay feels entirely of its own brand, and that is because it's built on the foundation of Arkane's domino-effect design.That is especially apparent as you uncover dead ends, of which there are many scattered around Deathloop's various environments. Documents peppered around the world will provide a small lead on something, which is then marked as a discovery, and the game does an excellent job of creating a breadcrumb trail around Blackreef for you to follow, and it always leads to something meaningful. Whether it's finding the code to open a locked door you stumbled upon hours ago or figuring out how to manipulate two Visionaries into appearing at the same place at the same time, you're never more than a run or two away from having an epiphany. And when it dawns upon you, the feeling will make you giddy. It's like using just the right wrench to loosen a nut that felt like it was impossibly tight.In many regards, Deathloop is a game about being meticulous, and Arkane has done a fantastic job in making just being in the world, looking around, and listening to it enthralling. It should come as no surprise that Blackreef is absolutely stunning to behold, given the strong sense of art direction the studio's previous games have had. Each of the four areas of the game has a distinct style, which changes depending on the time of day thanks to lighting and even weather effects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8722dd6a-3203-4f22-b168-18694dc4d76a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8722dd6a-3203-4f22-b168-18694dc4d76a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "81c1ea44-647b-4a69-a696-f4840f1c2d43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c599cf8afe8cb039453b491be1c56897a6ba97de391cb9bc8a110ee46e6705f5"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad2b62f4-40f7-4f7f-b41f-ddb15616d0cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d1ac7bc66eb4b46a5c5e77b5d827d0976fc5db5d6ceeba2f1007630297017afc"}}, "hash": "10eb2f28a26d26278215f7ee6e0995e26670db9436762fd78d401f2f9ea9022a", "text": "There's a wonderful retro pop-art motif that runs throughout, with eye-catching posters and signs that not only furnish each environment to be visually pleasing, but also serve as a kind of pathway for the player to explore. Architecture is constructed thoughtfully so, in any given scenario, you can see a way in and a way out. On the ground level, a neon billboard may draw your attention, revealing scaffolding that can be clambered up to give you a better vantage point. Or a spotlight on a stone wall may gesture towards an open window, offering a way into a building that otherwise seems impregnable.Of particular note are the '60s-esque interiors that are somehow both beautiful and utterly garish in the way only retro furniture can be. Wooden walls, shocking red pleather couches that look like they would make your arse numb after a minute of sitting on them, and oddly contorted lighting fixtures will stop you in your tracks so you can ogle how strange they are. But they also fit into the aesthetic so perfectly that you can't help but be impressed by the interior design chops being displayed. Needless to say, Arkane's sense of art direction remains impeccable and, for my money, unmatched.And complementing it is the raucous soundtrack that is as eclectic and as unexpected as the visual stylings. Continuing the mashup of style and themes, Deathloop transitions effortlessly between disparate styles to suit the needs of the moment from a cinematic standpoint, but also has you tapping your feet along to the chaos happening on screen. One minute you're creeping through underground tunnels, backed by the bleeps, bloops, and ambient warbles of old sci-fi movies in tense stealth sections, and the next you're engaged in an all-out gunfight with hordes of Eternalists to the sound of a big band orchestra and off-the-chain sax solos. Deathloop's gunplay is weighty and satisfying, and a great deal of the thrill that comes from trading lead is elevated by the brilliant, funky soundtrack.The final piece to Deathloop's gameplay puzzle is multiplayer, which manifests itself in two ways. The first is technically not multiplayer, as it sees Julianna invade Colt's game to try and assassinate him. This Julianna is computer-controlled but no less deadly for it. At random points, the game announces that Julianna has invaded and locked the exit points out the area. The only way to escape is to hack a specific point to unlock the exit tunnels, but to do that you have to go through her. These moments are genuinely terrifying, especially when you're on a good run. Julianna is capable of masking her appearance to look like any random Eternalist, so she could really be anywhere and anyone. And when she does have you in her crosshairs you better hope you have her in yours. She can be ruthless, but the reward for taking her out is massive. She will often drop a Slab, meaning you can acquire powers or upgrades without needing to kill the Visionary who has them. And if you're smart, you can even set up elaborate traps using turrets and grenades to get the jump on her.Of course, a human player--someone on your friends list, a random person on the internet, or even you--can choose to protect the loop by assuming the role of Julianna. As the hunter, you invade Colt's world with the goal of taking him out before he can kill you or escape. Unlike Colt, who has that ability to undo his deaths a couple of times, Julianna has just one shot at her mark, which means you need to be much more considered. However, the ability to mimic NPCs is a devious advantage that is much more effective than you might think, especially if you have a good understanding of the world and can use a player's knowledge against them.For example, you may know that there's a specific enemy that is always positioned in a specific spot and, if you're able to swap positions with them, the Colt player may just assume you're a harmless Eternalist, only for you to strike when they least suspect it. You can also use powers that are unlocked gradually as you continue to invade players. Julianna has her own progression tree that tasks her with completing feats such as successfully killing Colt in a specific way, surviving for a certain period of time, using a particular weapon, and so on. As you complete these, more Slab abilities, weapons, and trinkets become available, making you a deadlier killer. The sense of tension this introduces to gameplay is exhilarating as you never know when a Julianna could appear to turn your world upside down.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad2b62f4-40f7-4f7f-b41f-ddb15616d0cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad2b62f4-40f7-4f7f-b41f-ddb15616d0cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "8722dd6a-3203-4f22-b168-18694dc4d76a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "10eb2f28a26d26278215f7ee6e0995e26670db9436762fd78d401f2f9ea9022a"}, "3": {"node_id": "018aed44-d1b1-436e-a1be-c18a55847220", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ec75347d7bd2696c2de5d541f4f8df457ef2606f0eed875caca402accb3c3cb"}}, "hash": "d1ac7bc66eb4b46a5c5e77b5d827d0976fc5db5d6ceeba2f1007630297017afc", "text": "It harkens back to the kind of hide-and-seek multiplayer introduced in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and the PvP of the Soulsborne games, and it works really well within Deathloop. Of course, you can opt not to allow people to invade if you'd prefer a purely single-player experience.Perhaps the most laudable part of Deathloop is how it takes so many seemingly disparate things and creates harmony between them. Gameplay systems that feel isolated become pieces of a bigger puzzle, and when you see how they seamlessly connect together, you realize how special an achievement it really is. Similarly, on paper, the different aesthetics should be like oil and water, but they come together effortlessly to be part of a greater whole, and, for me, that's what Deathloop is really about. By standing back and looking at the bigger picture, the uncharacteristic choices and unexpected behaviors feel necessary--essential even. Maybe it's just what I need to believe to give all that killing meaning, but when I began the final loop and carved a perfect, bloody path through Blackreef's Visionaries in a single day, I made no ripples.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nGame Revolution, \nBy\n\nMack Ashworth \nDEATHLOOP REVIEW FOR PC AND PS5.With Deathloop, developer Arkane Studios clearly aims to incorporate lessons learned from Dishonored, Prey, and earlier games with a new invasion element that adds multiplayer to the mix. It\u2019s this latter element that I was most interested in playing and, perhaps unsurprisingly, it\u2019s the game\u2019s standout feature. I\u2019ve waited a week since the game\u2019s launch to write this review, putting in the hours with the general public to properly assess how invasions play out.I love time travel stories and Deathloop perfectly captures the chaos that can ensue when temporal fabrics are fiddled with. In this instance, there\u2019s an island that\u2019s stuck in a loop, repeating the day over and over again.It\u2019s up to the player, who\u2019s put in the shoes of the wonderfully-voiced Colt, to stop the loop. Ending the cycle means taking out eight targets all on the same day. These enemies are situated on different levels and appear at different times, so it\u2019s initially impossible to take them all out.Colt must work to gather information about each target and use that against them. These reconnaissance missions take up the bulk of the playthrough and they are, unfortunately, not very interesting from a gameplay perspective. You warp in, grab whatever you need, and then warp out. There are no difficulty settings, either, so you quickly learn that enemies pose very little threat.Armed with the new intel, Colt is able to coordinate his murders. The pay-off is great, as you retread familiar ground to move effortlessly between missions, knowing where everyone will be and exactly what is going to happen. This culminates in a memorable finale, though I was hoping for something unexpected to throw Colt through one final loop. Sadly, it ends when you think it will end, and I saw the credits roll after 12 hours.To aid Colt on his mission to wipe out the eight Visionaries causing the island to loop continuously, he has an arsenal of weapons and abilities. Weapons can be collected from all enemies and abilities are taken from the boss encounters. There are also Trinkets that bestow Colt himself with additional buffs. These can all be \u201cInfused\u201d so that they can keep them between loops.Unfortunately, I quickly found my go-to loadout that I was happy to plow through the game with and I found no reason to upgrade. I happily let the loop discard new loot without a second thought, as filtering through the inventory takes too long. I only really cared about the ability upgrades, especially for invisibility, dash, and damage reduction. Everything else seemed more like a sidegrade.If the enemies provided a bigger challenge I would have cared more about micromanaging the equipment I used, but its artificial intelligence is alarmingly unintelligent. While it\u2019s a joy to dance around the AI and know their patrol patterns, making me feel like the King of Time Travel, I never felt at risk of dying by their hands. Colt almost immediately gets the \u201cReprise\u201d ability, which essentially gives him three lives. It\u2019s like a mandatory easy mode and removes any tension.While stealth is an option, the game doesn\u2019t shame you for choosing to run and gun.

There are only four main areas in total and they are smaller than I was expecting. Considering how many times players are going to be revisiting them, there\u2019s too little there. With that said, for those interested in the lore and reading their video games instead of playing them, Arkane has included a bunch of letters, diaries, and whatnot that help to shape the world.The levels might be small, but they at least look pretty good. On PS5 there are three different visual modes. Players can choose between a 60 FPS target for smoothness or higher fidelity visuals but at a lower frame rate.I stuck with the 60 FPS performance mode. The game still looks good and the frame rate is mostly solid. I did notice drops when moving quickly through a level and when Julianna was invading, but these hiccups were few and far between. It plays nicely on PS5, though I know PC players have been experiencing issues that Arkane recently acknowledged.Where Deathloop truly shines is its multiplayer. It\u2019s a simple idea: Julianna, a Visionary hellbent on preventing Colt from stopping the loop, invades the level and tries to eliminate you. With the game set to \u201cOnline,\u201d and assuming the playerbase remains populated, this will often be a real-world player.The occasions where Julianna invaded were easily the highlights of my playthrough. It\u2019s a game of cat and mouse, and avoiding or hunting her down is a true thrill. Her powers aren\u2019t as good as Colt\u2019s and she only has one life, but she can disguise herself and see Colt\u2019s position when other enemies spot him.Even when I lose the fight, I find invasions so thrilling that I\u2019ve become addicted. I now load into a map and hunt down Julianna as quickly as possible. Or, I play as Julianna and aim to rapidly dispatch Colt with brutal aggression. It\u2019s so much fun and I encourage everyone who plays this game to set it to \u201cOnline\u201d and avoid single-player, which drastically waters down the experience and ruins the magic.Speedy. #PS5Share, #DEATHLOOP pic.twitter.com/gm2Gnauo71\u2014 Mack Ashworth (@GamingWithMack) September 19, 2021The multiplayer is not perfect, though, and I\u2019ve noticed a few cracks in the week since launch. First, matchmaking times can be very long. When you consider that this is when the game should be at its peak player count, that\u2019s pretty worrying. There\u2019s no cross-play support, either, so the player pools are already kneecapped. Xbox players will have a better time when the game comes out on Xbox Series X|S, as it\u2019s to be featured in the Xbox Game Pass, but PC and PS5 players have no such solution.My next concern is the overpowered execution moves. These are OP in single-player, too, but it\u2019s during Colt and Julianna fights where the issue is most prevalent. Jumping over either character allows for a quick instant kill. These executions from above and the front should be disabled when the characters have been spotted.My other main concern is the\u00a0antennae location. There is only one location on each map, so encounters often play out the same, and not in a good way. I can use the antennae location and knowledge that Julianna will spawn near it to achieve ridiculously aggressive plays as seen in the above tweet.At its best, Deathloop successfully captures\u00a0the essence of those time-travel movies where the protagonist moves with suave confidence as they know where every enemy will be and how to flawlessly execute their plan.In order to avoid the tedium organically produced by playing the same level over and over, Arkane has implemented a truly magical multiplayer component, one that has the potential to offer top-tier multiplayer moments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "348aa873-bc01-41c6-872a-925a08c7711c": {"__data__": {"id_": "348aa873-bc01-41c6-872a-925a08c7711c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "018aed44-d1b1-436e-a1be-c18a55847220", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ec75347d7bd2696c2de5d541f4f8df457ef2606f0eed875caca402accb3c3cb"}, "3": {"node_id": "06f97865-36e0-4cff-b5ac-a538af0d2bb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "967fc78202377e3a20aaf9f1b873686b0e6f9b1acee963579ce58b991238f6ef"}}, "hash": "6c0b0e01a4ad692a305463fc05fe2fa1857ceaf0d7adcc2e6d062a7cd3765f4d", "text": "Unfortunately, the weak recon missions made too easy by the lack of challenge from AI enemies, the small number of maps that are quickly mastered, and the limited variety in gameplay burdened by uninspired upgrades, ultimately prevent Deathloop from reaching the highest of highs.With online multiplayer enabled and embraced, however, it becomes easier to overlook the weak points and Deathloop comes out on the other side as a compelling lesson in how intimate multiplayer can greatly enhance the single-player formula.Deathloop was reviewed on PS5 with code provided by the publisher.8Mack is slowly grinding his way to Level 100. With each article you read, he gets 1 XP! // 23,597 XP UNTIL NEXT LEVEL //Share article\nDestructoid, darkI tried to go into Deathloop as blind as possible, only glancing at trailers in the middle of conferences, and avoiding everything else.I suggest you do the same.Deathloop (PC, PS5 [reviewed]) Developer: Arkane Studios Publisher: Bethesda Released: September 14, 2021 MSRP: $59.99Still reading? Well I won\u2019t give away too much!\u201cGroundhog Day with two assassins by way of Arkane\u201d sums up the premise of Deathloop, which is enough to entice a large chunk of people; especially\u00a0Dishonored and\u00a0Prey fans. Arkane definitely dips into the font of those two games, and ends up pouring a refreshing drink that\u2019s generally bolder, and more flavorful than several past efforts.Personality is not a problem in\u00a0Deathloop, for one. Colt, your avatar and the main event of this time-looping mess, is more interesting than the entire cast of most modern AAA games. The banter between him and Julianna (his rival) is glorious, and manages to rise above the typical edgy dialogue of a lot of shooters by actually making you laugh out loud. The \u201960s decor and fashion sense help bring out that personality more, especially with all that marvelous wood-based interior design! Nothing better than techy sci-fi clashing with wood.Deathloop\u2018s primary weapon is that it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. The game highly encourages experimentation, loadout swapping, and exploration, and makes all of that very easy. The way the core loop (as it were) works is that you have an ultimate end goal in mind, but an unlimited amount of time to figure out how to do it. \u201cDays\u201d are broken up by morning, afternoon, and evening periods; all of which feature different environmental changes in four areas (connected by central tunnels, which you start and end every period in), and have key NPCs (Visionaries, which are basically bosses) in different spots. During all this, Julianna can randomly pop in as an extra encounter, both as an AI or as another player.Loadouts, initially, are tenuous at best. You can\u2019t keep all of your gear between loops, but very early you discover a mechanic that lets you pump what is essentially leveling currency into keeping items permanently. While a lot of games would make this process deliberately obtuse and annoying, I had what I could consider an \u201cideal\u201d personal loadout in a little over an hour of playtime. From there, it was mainly tweaking, and adding extra flair for specific encounters (sneaking around, versus head-on fighting/boss battles).It\u2019s a very, very chill game with a lot going on, which is a feat to balance both so well. In case you\u2019re worried, it doesn\u2019t feel anything like a roguelike or a roguelite. The time loop gimmick actually serves the player at a foundational level, which really helped me become invested in it: I couldn\u2019t stop playing from the time I installed it. Deathloop gets very fun to play very fast because it\u2019s willing to get kooky and arcadey. Case in point: I was given a double-jump almost immediately and it was off to the races.What are essentially magic powers (conducted through relics called \u201cslates\u201d) supercharge everything, providing access to berserker strength, stealth, teleportation, and more. Colt\u2019s unique power is that he can die three times each day before starting over a loop: essentially providing you with three lives (complete with the now-classic \u201cloot your corpse to regain your currency\u201d conceit). Arkane could have gone the gritty route with grounded Call of Duty style clamboring and sliding (which is in!), but they plussed it up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06f97865-36e0-4cff-b5ac-a538af0d2bb1": {"__data__": {"id_": "06f97865-36e0-4cff-b5ac-a538af0d2bb1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "348aa873-bc01-41c6-872a-925a08c7711c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c0b0e01a4ad692a305463fc05fe2fa1857ceaf0d7adcc2e6d062a7cd3765f4d"}, "3": {"node_id": "39771388-cffa-49af-af6e-fc2824d7f109", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "47ae522f0a01f310bc63518e087ded7a6d28857eb373a78b2f044a47c83c8d50"}}, "hash": "967fc78202377e3a20aaf9f1b873686b0e6f9b1acee963579ce58b991238f6ef", "text": "), but they plussed it up. Getting these powers is meaningful, too, as bosses (which respawn every day) basically poop out materia, which you can then pay to keep permanently (dupe abilities will provide upgrades).Beyond chipping away at the critical path, part of the joy is slowly uncovering the mystery of why you\u2019re in the loop, and I\u2019ll basically leave it at that. The in-game mission screen is centered around this premise, offering a conspiracy theory style pinboard to help you slowly unravel everything. You can do multiple parts at once depending on the area you\u2019re in, or take it bit by bit, and start fresh the next day.However you choose to play, the game saves your mission progress/knowledge like passcodes and major revelations: so you don\u2019t need to repeat a ton of things over and over until you get it perfectly right (nor do you have to memorize what you were doing). Again, Arkane could have gone so south with the number of roguelike elements they could have crammed in, but it really does play like an action-adventure that just happens to take place in a time loop.All of these mechanics help facilitate cycle-based runs through a selection of four sandboxes that are combed through the way you want to. It isn\u2019t perfect though. I encountered a few instances of \u201cgo here\u2026oh actually now that you\u2019re here, you need to come back in the morning.\u201d Great! At least I had the opportunity to scour the immediate area, have some fun, head back, keep what I wanted by investing in those items, then dive back into the zone within a few minutes. Slightly annoying, but ultimately painless.What wasn\u2019t as painless was my encounter with several glitches on PS5, all of them menu-based. Sometimes when selecting a loadout the menu won\u2019t load, and on a few occasions, it locked up and didn\u2019t let me quit or start a mission. The only solution was to reboot, which let me pick up right where I left off due to the auto-save system. Your mileage may vary, but I encountered menu lag twice (which cleared up after 30 seconds), and soft crashing twice.What I find especially fun is the post-mission \u201crun back.\u201d It\u2019s a blast to figure out different paths to return to the tunnels before the next time period begins each day while all hell is breaking loose, and Deathloop entices you to come back under different circumstances to encounter new activities. None of the zones feel bloated: they\u2019re packed just enough to warrant multiple runs without getting old, without providing the sense that they\u2019re jammed with Ubisoft open world busywork.At what I would call a \u201cmedium pace,\u201d I finished\u00a0Deathloop in around 10 hours (after the game ends, you can repeat the final day or start over). Part of the genius is that if you want to rush it, you can. If you want to take twice as long, you can too. There\u2019s a lot of speedrunning potential in Deathloop, and I\u2019m stoked to see what people come up with as the \u201coptimal way to solve the game.\u201dThe other part of\u00a0Deathloop\u00a0is playing as Julianna, which has a very 2010s \u201cwe need multiplayer in this game\u201d feel at first, but ends up being a bonus rather than something that detracts from Deathloop as a whole. Your job is to dive into another (human) Colt\u2019s game via matchmaking, and take them out, similar to invading a game in a\u00a0Souls joint. It has its own loadout screen and progression system, as well as a few subtle story bits. You can even turn off human invasions and restrict them entirely to AI as Colt. What I\u2019m saying is you can ignore it, but it\u2019s also justified.Extra mode or not, the main game is not compromised in any way.\u00a0Deathloop combines a classic Arkane stealthy-shooty foundation with a genuinely interesting and fun premise to aplomb.

Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowAt long last, Deathloop is here to challenge us to crack its elaborate time-skipping murder puzzle, but is it a cycle worth repeating?For about two years, Arkane Studios has been preparing an interesting evolution of its games in Deathloop. It\u2019s a first-person action shooter in which you replay the same day in an effort to kill eight targets scattered throughout an island of people ready to kill you on sight. It was a bit hard to grasp for a while, but the outcome is something amazing. Mixing stealth, weighty gunplay, supernatural powers, and play-your-way weapons and gadgets, Deathloop is a greatest-hits amalgam of Arkane style with a splash of grindhouse grittiness and a satisfying murder puzzle narrative to put it apart from anything that has come before.In Deathloop, you play as the rough and tumble Colt Vahn. Colt wakes up one morning on the island of Blackreef, which is home to a society that enjoys the luxury of living the same day in an endless time loop. They are ordered to kill Colt on sight because he betrayed the organization that created the loop and is trying to break free of it. If Colt is going to get away from this cycle of death, he has to kill eight \u201cVisionary\u201d targets that keep the loop stabilized in the span of one day. Easier said than done as they\u2019re scattered across the island with their own agendas and routines. All of it makes for an elaborate murder puzzle you\u2019re going to have to put together piece by piece, learning more with each repeat of the day and the opportunities your collected information gives you.If that wasn\u2019t enough, Colt has a constant companion through his time looping journey. The only other person on Blackreef that seems to keep their memory loop after loop is Julianna Blake, who oversees hunting Colt down and making sure he doesn\u2019t break the cycle. Julianna likes to stay in touch with Colt, whether through radio contact in which the two share regular banter or through trying to put a bullet in his noggin when she arrives in a zone he\u2019s exploring. Julianna and Colt\u2019s conversations are some of the funniest parts of the game and where secrets pertaining to the island, why everyone is there, and how things ended up the way they did come out.Those conversations also help set the tone of the game. Deathloop is extremely grindhouse in its nature. Everything is brash and dirty. You have weapons that mostly look like they were cobbled together from scrap and yet somehow feel great, and the island has all sorts of scenery, from squalor and repurposed old structures to scientific facilities, bunkers, art installations, and snazzy clubs. The island of Blackreef is generally breathtaking and each area takes on drastically new life as you progress through a day unraveling its secrets.All of this is also aided by a fantastic soundtrack that keeps the vibe electric whether you\u2019re sneaking about like a silent assassin or making a ruckus with a loud and proud shotgun.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1881c663-b6a4-46bc-814a-2fd126a598b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "1881c663-b6a4-46bc-814a-2fd126a598b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "39771388-cffa-49af-af6e-fc2824d7f109", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "47ae522f0a01f310bc63518e087ded7a6d28857eb373a78b2f044a47c83c8d50"}, "3": {"node_id": "44655829-11c1-4632-ba81-0326351877ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2bf3f8f6787ebde7becab9f5de24483c974cc40c3e90d66c17e67aaff1b3ca3"}}, "hash": "cafa6812728970d663aa33452cf40082500a354826fb1700e04e240f2451c6f6", "text": "In particular, there\u2019s a core tune that feels like it\u2019s repackaged nicely across the various areas, sounding jazzy when you\u2019re fighting in the club or sounding a little close to the riff of Led Zeppelin\u2019s Whole Lotta Love when you\u2019re fighting your way across the scarred bunker area of the island. I really loved how well the music of this game played and adapted into whatever I was doing. It ties a delightful bow on a immersive package of narrative, puzzle-solving, and combat.So let\u2019s talk about how you actually do go about breaking the loop and escaping Blackreef\u2019s insanity. Guns and powers aren\u2019t your primary weapon in Deathloop. Rather, information is the greatest weapon of all in this game. Each day, you get to explore different locations like Karl\u2019s Bay or Fristad Rock during four different times of the day: Morning, Noon, Afternoon, and Night. Time won\u2019t move forward till you leave a region to head back to your hideout. However, as you explore different places, you will find different clues that are either universal to the location or specific to a time of day. For instance, one Visionary can only be found in Karl\u2019s Bay in the Morning, then they disappear.By exploring different places during different times of day, you glean clues and leads that will help you arm yourself better or optimize Visionary kills. With a running tab on info from everywhere you explore at every time, it\u2019s all a very smart design that will have you valuing every clue as if it were gold. The only thing that can be tough about this is that your life can be depleted three times throughout the day. After the third time, you die for good and have to restart the day, losing anything you haven\u2019t preserved through a special method. That can be deflating when you\u2019re on the cusp of a breakthrough only to be gunned down at the finish line.Not to say the real weapons aren\u2019t rather fun. Deathloop has quite the arsenal for whether players want to play loud or silent. There are a number of basic weapon categories, as well as higher quality versions and variations of them. For instance, there\u2019s a machine gun that puts out a hailstorm of bullets, but if you find a purple variant of it, it might make enemies explode when you kill them with headshots. You also might find a nail gun that lets you kill enemies far easier if you mark them first. You can also upgrade both the weapons and Colt with Trinkets. These equippable modifications add things like better firing rate, higher damage, and faster reloads to guns. Meanwhile, Trinkets for Colt give him perks like taking less damage, finding more ammo, and not taking damage from big falls, just to name a few effects.Then there\u2019s the Slabs. These give you supernatural powers. Only Visionaries and Julianna have them and getting them is tough, but oh so worth it. They allow you to do typical Arkane things like blink forward through space or turn invisible, but I think my favorite was Nexux. It allows you to link enemies in close proximity together and kill them all by taking out one. It\u2019s absolutely delicious when you cue it up on three or more people and then pump a shot from a silenced nail gun into one noggin to silently ice a whole crew. Weapons, trinkets, and powers thoroughly cater to your needs in Deathloop and they feel great. You also eventually get a method to preserve your favorite gear so you can keep them through loops. That way, you can keep and evolve your favored playstyle throughout the game and capture some very lovely rare weapons to keep for your collection.I mentioned Julianna has some good stuff and that will come into play quite often. If you\u2019re in an area with a Visionary and you haven\u2019t already killed her that day, there\u2019s a chance Julianna will appear to lock your escape route and hunt you till she kills you or you kill her. She will be played by AI or another player based on your settings.

He has three lives and you have one, so you can absolutely be devious about it, hiding among henchmen, taking up ranks alongside a Visionary, and setting traps for him.

I also like that you can change Julianna's invasions to Single Player to play against AI if you'd rather not bet on the challenge of random players cutting your run short. You can even set it on Friends Only to limit Julianna appearances to your trusted buddies. That last one is a very lovely touch.I\u2019d like to say Deathloop is perfect, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s not without some quirks, and some nasty ones at that. At the very worst, I had the game crash on me a few times \u2013 notably, once when I was loading in to play as Julianna and once as I initiated a firefight with unsuspecting enemies on the first shot. It just booted me out to the dashboard and I had to restart from whatever stage of the day I was at, leading to some lengthy lost exploration in one case. I can confirm from other sources that PC also experienced some crashes in similar manners. The game has some glitches, too. There were a few times where I caught enemies stuck in their own mini loops of animation, running at doors and never opening them. There were also occasional graphical glitches like smoke textures artifacting in ways that didn\u2019t seem purposeful. These weren\u2019t by any means frequent or jarring enough to break the game, but they do keep it from being absolutely untarnished.There are so many things I love about Deathloop it\u2019s hard to limit myself in gushing about it. It\u2019s not just some of the best design I\u2019ve seen out of one of my favorite studios, Arkane has also incorporated fun elements from games like Dark Souls and Hitman into Deathloop to make it altogether its own deliciously unique offering. AI can bumble a bit and the cost of failure can be high, but Deathloop still delivers a visceral and engaging murder puzzle that demands thorough investigation and gritty gunplay down to its final twists and turns. Colt and Julianna\u2019s rivalry keeps the tension and stakes high and it\u2019s a loop I\u2019ll be going back to over and over again, whether to break it or break other players for trying to break it.This review is based on a digital PS5 version supplied by the publisher.

One might argue that Arkane Studios has embraced something of a loop itself, too. There\u2019s a certain type of game they make, a certain feel that ties together Dishonored, Prey, and now Deathloop. Like this game\u2019s lead, Arkane has forged a new path with a canny combination of repetition and experimentation; repeating and refining many of the mechanics and ideas that made their past games great, while introducing new concepts that serve to elevate the game as a whole.Like I said, chief among those mechanics is the loop. The island of Blackreef has been trapped inside a repeating daily cycle - and so regardless of if you die or survive the course of the day, you\u2019ll wake up back in the same spot on the same morning. In the single-player narrative, protagonist Colt Vahn\u2019s mission is to break the loop - which can only be done by committing a specific set of murders. Your targets are often well-fortified and protected, and thus reaching them will require a bunch of knowledge that, at the game\u2019s onset, Colt doesn\u2019t have.Deathloop is built around this basic conceit.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae97eb58-93e2-4228-b128-9cebd395b164": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae97eb58-93e2-4228-b128-9cebd395b164", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "44655829-11c1-4632-ba81-0326351877ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2bf3f8f6787ebde7becab9f5de24483c974cc40c3e90d66c17e67aaff1b3ca3"}, "3": {"node_id": "a188faba-2909-4c5b-9583-30e4ec4c1e91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "616c8b80ad96350197268130578891bdfbc1c526a6e86078e8d661062a4a561a"}}, "hash": "b1c175e959734e8c09a23d3243db0ab9a981ad386bff56e08ee5d02e020c838e", "text": "You\u2019ll have leads on intelligence, new weapons, and ways to assassinate your targets - and though it\u2019s impossible to tackle every lead at once, Colt and his rival assassin, Juliana, keep their knowledge between loops, while everyone else forgets. In some ways the way you approach this is linear - you get a bunch of information throughout a day that\u2019ll allow you to do something specific in the next loop. In other ways it\u2019s more open-ended, where you\u2019re basically unlocking shortcuts - a passcode to a door learned in one loop will be remembered and can be used next time, and so on. Given the proximity of the two releases, it\u2019s difficult for me to talk about the time loop-driven information gathering of Deathloop without also thinking about the recently released Twelve Minutes - a game that uses the same trick. Twelve Minutes has come in for a lot of criticism for a lot of very valid reasons, but the way it doled out information and encouraged the player to use their knowledge from past loops to advance was one of the best things about the game. Deathloop has that - but just does it all better.Time on Blackreef is split into a few different slices - Morning, Noon, Afternoon, and Evening. Rather than an in-game clock slowly advancing, each of the island\u2019s zones has a unique world state at each time of day, meaning you get four \u2018attempts\u2019 at one of the island\u2019s zones each in-game day. Depending on what time it is, people will be doing different things, areas will be locked or unlocked, and certain major events will be either in preparation or ongoing. Because you have to complete a specific set of objectives in order to break the loop, there\u2019s also a scheduling puzzle element, too - to succeed, you need to figure out a schedule that\u2019ll let you do everything you need to do in one day. On top of this, you have to juggle your equipment and abilities between loops. While Colt keeps his knowledge from one loop to the next, the only way you can keep gear and abilities is through \u2018Infusion\u2019, a process that binds items to you and ensures you respawn with them when time loops due to death or the end of the day. Infusion costs a resource you collect while exploring and fighting - and there\u2019s never quite enough, forcing difficult calls.It\u2019s challenging to explain how potent all of this is, and how cleverly it slots together with the school of design Arkane is so proficient at wielding. Gone is the skill tree, replaced with the more organic action of picking things up and facing agonizing decisions of what to infuse and keep for future loops. One type of skill, Slabs, are what I\u2019d call the prototypical Arkane abilities. There\u2019s one that\u2019s basically just like Dishonored\u2019s \u2018Blink\u2019 ability, for instance.These only drop from the boss characters, and are expensive as hell to infuse and keep. Multiple times I found myself pained as I decided between different Slabs, as each is uniquely useful.Then there\u2019s how the concept of the loop interacts with the story. Those classic immersive sim touches - audio files, notes, computer terminal chat logs - they\u2019re no longer just world building, but often vital pieces of information that can be used in the next loop. Even idle overheard chatter between the grunt enemies peppered across the island can hold important clues - and it\u2019s a genius way to ensnare the interest of even those players who wouldn\u2019t naturally fully engage with Deathloop\u2019s excellently written narrative.Arkane is known for being pretty damn good at story stuff, and Deathloop is no exception. I think what\u2019s most impressive about it is that there\u2019s a well-developed cast of characters here - not just Colt and Juliana, the duelling assassins featured prominently in marketing, but also the other core characters that make up the architects and targets of Blackreef. These are the sorts of characters that are probably going to launch an avalanche of fan cosplay, art, and fiction. In-game, you mostly get to know them by hearing them on intercoms and skulking through their lairs, reading instant messaging logs and scribbled notes. To a degree, some of this feels a little like the best of BioShock - but focused on a fun, pulpy, tongue-in-cheek universe more than any navel-gazing philosophy. You\u2019re prodded to play as Colt first, to see and experience the story of Deathloop.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a188faba-2909-4c5b-9583-30e4ec4c1e91": {"__data__": {"id_": "a188faba-2909-4c5b-9583-30e4ec4c1e91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae97eb58-93e2-4228-b128-9cebd395b164", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b1c175e959734e8c09a23d3243db0ab9a981ad386bff56e08ee5d02e020c838e"}, "3": {"node_id": "692348f5-ee7c-4f65-b6c9-f19bf0ab3974", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "be81e9ab9713be30aff7b5153feea15c649b166737218c691265d7e88539b00b"}}, "hash": "616c8b80ad96350197268130578891bdfbc1c526a6e86078e8d661062a4a561a", "text": "You can do this on or offline, and regardless of which, your game can occasionally be \u2018invaded\u2019 by an AI or human-controlled Juliana that\u2019ll work to hunt you down. As Colt, you\u2019re faced with a choice when Juliana appears. If you don\u2019t want to engage her, a character with equal abilities to yours, you can flee the zone, advancing time and missing whatever you were in that area at that time of day to do. If you stand and fight, it\u2019ll be one of the hardest encounters but will give up awesome rewards. The invasion stuff is a cool little wrinkle when playing the story, but the real fun comes when you\u2019re on the other side. After familiarizing yourself with Blackreef you can take on the role of Juliana and invade other people\u2019s games. Some of Deathloop\u2019s earlier marketing might\u2019ve given the impression that this competitive online element was the core of the game, that it\u2019s a title with a multiplayer focus. It isn\u2019t; it\u2019s a single-player adventure first. But the ability to play as Juliana and invade others is a super satisfying way to see this world from another perspective, giving you a reason to keep playing. Ruining another person\u2019s day is pretty fun, too.The reason you\u2019d want to keep playing is pretty damn simple, too: Deathloop feels bloody fabulous. It\u2019s a tight-yet-slick game, with the options at your disposal at any given time all feeling equally viable - and crucially, equally fun. There\u2019s none of that mismatch often in games like this where going guns blazing doesn\u2019t feel quite right due to how the weapons handle, or where stealth is clunky and frustrating. Everything feels smooth and satisfying, from hacking doors and turrets to all-out gunfights, rapid parkour traversal to crouch-walking your way through a building while racking up stealth takedowns. When things go wrong, it\u2019s easy to quickly switch approaches and pull out a big, loud gun.The game does seem to want you to play stealthy, though - psychedelic notes from Colt\u2019s alternate dimension selves often caution you \u201cmaybe don\u2019t go loud\u201d before entering enemy strongholds and the like - but guns blazing is totally an option if that\u2019s what you desire. The weapons, upgrades (known here as trinkets) and slabs you choose to infuse to keep across loops will help to create a character build that\u2019ll let you lean into a specific play-style.I do have the odd criticism, of course. For example, with how important to the narrative and Colt\u2019s knowledge various scattered items are, it\u2019s frustrating that a readable crumpled-up note can have the same item model as one that\u2019s unreadable, unrelated background clutter. I sometimes think the enemy AI is a little too quick to spot you from stealth - though certain slabs can remedy that. One of the guns included in the Digital Deluxe Edition is very good early on and felt a bit like cheating. I reviewed it on PS5, and I found the fine adjustments of aiming on a controller when trying to long-range headshot people in stealth to be fiddly thanks to low sensitivity - I can\u2019t wait to start playing it on PC. These are all small critiques, of course. Certainly nothing game-breaking or earth-shattering. Taken as a single-player experience, Deathloop feels complete and incredibly well-rounded. The extra injection of optional multiplayer action is a fabulous cherry on top. Basically, Deathloop is everything I wanted it to be. It\u2019s confident both as a successor to many of the ideas of Dishonored while also expressly its own thing, with a tone and sense of style I absolutely adore. It\u2019s one of my favourite games of the year - and one we\u2019ll surely be talking about for months to come. \n        Sign in and unlock a world of features\n      \n        Get access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "692348f5-ee7c-4f65-b6c9-f19bf0ab3974": {"__data__": {"id_": "692348f5-ee7c-4f65-b6c9-f19bf0ab3974", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "a188faba-2909-4c5b-9583-30e4ec4c1e91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "616c8b80ad96350197268130578891bdfbc1c526a6e86078e8d661062a4a561a"}, "3": {"node_id": "ab01590a-e4a3-4907-b424-7d58a2e26609", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5662b875f20bbff2c7783154afef8a0003af5972f980f198703e6ab6df3920c1"}}, "hash": "be81e9ab9713be30aff7b5153feea15c649b166737218c691265d7e88539b00b", "text": "Close    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nAlex Donaldson\n\n          Assistant Editor\n        Alex started out his career in games media as an over-eager kid working on fan sites, and now has decades of experience.

Deathloop is certainly more ambitious than yet another generic shooter, which I appreciate. The studio behind it (Arkane Lyon, creators of Dishonored) can't be faulted for not playing it safe. But ambition alone isn't enough.You may very well enjoy Deathloop's big swings\u2014and at their best, they combine into something special. But there's no denying the sloppiness players have to wade through to find the good stuff. Even though its core is compelling, Deathloop simply doesn't feel finished. Instead, it seems unpolished, like it was rushed out the door. And its die-and-retry gimmick doesn't make up for a confusing lack of world building or an egregiously small gameplay universe.Imagine waking up as a full-blown amnesiac inside the world of a complicated video game\u2014that's how Deathloop starts. The game forgoes any introduction or stage-setting cut scenes. Fade from black, and the game's hero, Colt (you, in first-person perspective), screams in confusion as he is assaulted with knife stabs and F-bombs by Julianna, the game's constant antagonist. Moments later, another version of Colt shows up and saves you from a life-ending fall off a cliff. Then he drops you anyway.You wake up after this brutal end at the exact same place and time, thus confirming the \"deathloop\" in the game's name. All of your inventory is gone. But this time, at least, your consciousness is retaining memories. No more amnesia. The first thing you remember is a password to open a critical door. From here, you set out to accumulate knowledge and break this time loop.\u00a0No one clarifies why Julianna keeps trying to kill you or why everyone on this time-bent island doesn't just chill out and enjoy being able to survive death over and over again.Every time you rewind from death, different things pop up on the beach where you wake: a gun, a hacking device (to unlock doors and remotely disable turrets), a \"shard\" that enables a special ability, and a \"trinket\" that buffs up one of your weapons. After the first few hours of gameplay, you'll learn how to \"bind\" more weapons, shards, and trinkets to your consciousness. That way, they appear on the beach with you every morning, which is useful for the more dangerous scenarios ahead.Shards are the most Dishonored-like part of your loadout, since they enable magical abilities. Some are rote, like a double-jump (the starting default) and a midair dash. Others are wild, such as Karnesis, which lets you throw enemies' bodies around, and Nexus, which lets you drop a temporary cloud near a crowd of enemies. Hit any enemy in this cloud with an attack, and all the others nearby will feel it. Nexus is a fun way to clear out a cluster of foes who might block your preferred sneaking path.After about two hours of playtime in\u00a0Deathloop,\u00a0you figure out how to break the time loop and escape: Colt must kill all eight \"Visionaries\" on Blackreef Island. Crucially, he must kill all of them in a single day, which requires getting your daily murder planner down pat. Each day is split into four chunks (dawn, noon, dusk, and evening), and the island itself is broken up into four discrete regions. This isn't a roguelike; the world is static, so its buildings, objectives, and events are consistent. But its\u00a0events run on a schedule, the same every loop, which makes a place different at dusk than it is at any other time of day.As an example, you can explore the Updaam district as long as you want with no timer counting down\u2014so long as you get there at dawn. As soon as you leave Updaam, the day moves about four hours ahead. Before you leave, you may stumble upon a clue in Updaam that tells you to come back at dusk. That's when a specific event will unfold that you can interrupt to, say, kill a Visionary or pick up a useful item. But, gosh, I need to go elsewhere at dusk to finish another mission.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a8582a5-9682-48d5-b85f-f98976c4e3ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a8582a5-9682-48d5-b85f-f98976c4e3ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24b3e0fb-8df0-4ff7-9e86-1eb7e201eca0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2628a4eff0bdb9eb913f59dc86662973f1e1c81e35f9ce4a79dcb15e4e941a73"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab01590a-e4a3-4907-b424-7d58a2e26609", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5662b875f20bbff2c7783154afef8a0003af5972f980f198703e6ab6df3920c1"}}, "hash": "929e992a2d98dd7bbbe6f1913fe8e4ec221cbac2dc7f7879ffde9b23ce496da8", "text": "But, gosh, I need to go elsewhere at dusk to finish another mission. You know what they say: Why do today what you can delay for the next, uh, time loop?You die every time you run out the day by leaving an island portion during the \"evening\" slot. After that, you wake up anew on the aforementioned beach at dawn, equipped with new bundles of intel and newly \"bound\" weapons and items to do it all over again, looping once more from dawn to midnight. Eventually, you'll gather the knowledge and items necessary to chain together the perfect full-day itinerary, bouncing to the right parts of the island at the right time of day to kill all eight Visionaries.In good news, Deathloop mostly does a tidy job of tracking the hints and intel you pick up as you explore each corner of the island. Pick through a veritable corkboard of clues to narrow down any hints and outright objectives, then use menu toggles to stick them to your preferred time of day or island region. Usually, you can chain together something useful to do at each time of day, which is good because you'll accumulate \"Residuum\" points through the course of a full day\u2014and you'll need these points to permanently bind any nifty new items you find to your future loops. If you'd rather skip straight to one time of day, then start the whole day over after finishing a murderous errand. That's easy to do, too.Sounds intriguing, right? Well, that's only because I was talking you through it.Deathloop's opening is so obsessed with creating attitude and confusion that it fails as a gameplay introduction. Hints of each Visionary litter the island before you have any idea who they are, how many there are, or what their deal is. And you'd think the blocks of text that Colt sees over walls or in hallways would be useful. But no\u2014they're either head-smackingly obvious tips (\"go underground\") or portentous nonsense (\"Death died here,\" \"They've got no idea, no idea at all\").The constant chatter between Julianna and Colt over a radio system is equally useless. Mostly our two narrators are just trying to see who can swear more. Because Julianna has no interest in helping Colt, she uses the bulk of her air time to taunt and confuse him\u2014but guess what, Arkane? Colt isn't a real person. Deathloop's players are. And your narrative approach does them no favors.To piece together the game's cast, players must paw through notes, diaries, computer terminals, and audio logs, much like in Fallout and BioShock. But without any early anchor for how Deathloop's island functions or how characters relate to each other, it takes a long time before any of this content begins to click. This wouldn't be so bad if the game's buildings, posters, statues, or hallucinatory texts delivered their own storytelling\u2014maybe which Visionary lives where, what their belief system is, and how each cast member interacts with the others. Instead, the game's visual design focuses mostly on how outlandish the Visionaries are or how Colt is an intruder who needs to be stopped.Deathloop's missions eventually string together a vague story of the Visionaries' crisscrossing relationships. Clearly, someone at Arkane tried building a cohesive world where these characters grapple with the high-concept weirdness that keeps the islanders not only trapped in a time loop but also able to interact with clones of themselves. When it's good, it's classic, Bethesda-at-its-best storytelling. There are a few moments where Deathloop's plot shines in unique, only-in-games ways\u2014especially when you sneak up on certain characters talking to clones of themselves. But such highs only make\u00a0Deathloop's general plot failures all the more disappointing.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.
