A third person action game set in the Star Wars universe.\nExpect to pay: $60 / \u00a355\nDeveloper: Respawn Entertainment\nPublisher: EA\nReviewed on: GTX 970, 8GB RAM, Intel Core i5-4670K\nMultiplayer? No\nLink: Official siteYou are Cal Kestis, a bland-faced scrapper with too-clean hair and an inexplicable love for ponchos. You are also probably the deadliest person in the universe. Though you spend your days cutting crashed Star Destroyers open for parts, within your cloak you hide the true star of Jedi: Fallen Order\u2014a blue lightsaber that you will use to strike down hundreds of stormtroopers across the course of the game.If you concentrate on main story missions, this is about a 20-hour adventure set across a cluster of themed planets. There's a red one, a green one, an ice one, and so on\u2014common videogame fare. The story is set between the prequel trilogy of films and Episode 4: A New Hope, after the Sith has enacted Order 66 and turned the Republic's clone army against the Jedi. Cal's mission, once he realises he should probably get off the junk planet and follow his destiny, is to seize a 'holocron' data cache that contains a grand list of every force-sensitive child in the galaxy. Agents of the dark side are after it too, of course, and so begins a breezy, entertaining third-person action adventure with a fantastic lightsaber.It's one of the best weapons in fiction, and Respawn has done a great job of emulating the look and feel of the Jedi's signature weapon. It cracks to life when you press left on the D-pad. You can combo together light strikes by tapping the square/X button, and activate special attacks with the triangle/Y button. You hold left bumper to block incoming blaster fire and most enemy melee attacks. If you time your left bumper press well, you can parry enemies and send blaster fire hurtling right back at the trooper shooting you.This is incredibly satisfying, and the lightsaber hums and sparks exactly as it should. The combat system bears a loose resemblance to Sekiro. Enemies have a health bar and a posture bar. If you break the posture bar with parries or a flurry of attacks, Cal finishes his foe with a particularly flashy lightsaber strike. Most Stormtroopers are trivial to deal with, as they should be, and meet their fate with a hilarious collection of barks that range from statements of extreme overconfidence to cries of terror. If you rack up Cal's bodycount, he's kind of a monster.Elite troops offer a bit more challenge. You're being hunted across the galaxy by a Jedi-hunter called The Second Sister. She commands an elite cadre of troopers who will stand against your lightsaber with energy weapons. Skillful use of the lightsaber will still take them down, but you can also use a variety of force powers to freeze them in place, push them away, or pull them into range of your blade\u2014particularly useful against flying Imperial drones. Of course there are points where you fight an enemy who also has a lightsaber. These boss fights aren't too taxing, but they look extremely flashy and the music is great. You also kill a ton of animals, from space rats to giant space spiders.Your range of powers expands as the story grants you extra force abilities, but you can also level up Cal to unlock new attacks, or to modify existing force powers to, say, freeze a lot of enemies rather than one target. Here the game introduces a hint of Dark Souls. If you die you lose any skill points you have earned, but if you make it back and strike the enemy that killed you, you get them all back in a satisfying slow motion explosion.Jedi: Fallen Order's influences are famous for being intense and difficult, but Fallen Order isn't a huge challenge, and nor does it particularly want to be. These systems are nowhere near as punishing as they are in their source games, but they do successfully convey the power fantasy of being an elite Jedi fighter in a world of blaster fire and blustering stormtroopers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7559992-90aa-432e-8137-f4adf02ee45b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7559992-90aa-432e-8137-f4adf02ee45b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf096cb8-977e-4f33-a493-3fb6db9a8aaf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7c96418056830d24951c6b216935f14cec94295653702e2b0e344635f777dfdd"}, "3": {"node_id": "09c8914b-efb7-4841-b409-c80e50c979eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fefb7afff6f169b66afb183ac456cd82000e85f24f2d8de6e89c215adbcb8210"}}, "hash": "e742beb6881ab622f580e583c243aa01635e9c03135e767307667ce728f0957b", "text": "I put the difficulty up for a while, and while the game gets harder, it isn't a satisfying and cathartic experience like Sekiro and Dark Souls can be.It serves the fantasy, which if you're a Star Wars fan is likely enough reason to play the game. The Jedi experience is somewhat undermined by some of the contrived puzzles and paths of exploration, though not enough to completely break the experience for me. Each planet is essentially a massive tangled dungeon with a good mix of gorgeous exteriors and atmospheric Imperial bases. As you learn more powers, new routes and shortcuts open up on each level.\u00a0Challenging metroidvanias often test your memory by giving you a power and leaving you to find the unexplored route yourself. Here, again, Jedi: Fallen Order smooths over the experience for you. On your map passable doors are marked in green, impassable doors are marked in red, and unexplored areas are marked in yellow. This is another good decision\u2014it's hard to feel like a cool Jedi if you keep getting completely lost.The levels can be quite contrived at points. I started to feel a bit silly as I force-pushed giant gold balls into switches in an ancient Jedi temple. Cal mostly wall-runs, jumps, and swims his way through the maps, but sometimes\u2014too often\u2014you'll find yourself scooting down a massive bendy slide, which Cal rides like a surfer. There's a nice variety to traversal otherwise, however, and it's particularly fun to force-pull vines into your hands as you sail across yawning gaps.It's a very old fashioned third person action game in many respects. The game segues smoothly between a jumping section, a fight, a wall-run, a puzzle, another fight. Fallen Order mixes up its interactions just enough to keep up a reassuring pace. It's also a self-contained single player game, which is a novelty in 2019. There are no loot boxes or microtransactions or games-as-service promotions. Customisation options are simply rewards for exploring. As you rummage around in boxes hidden on each planet, you can unlock new poncho colours, new spaceship paintjobs and\u2014brilliantly for Star Wars fans\u2014bits of lightsaber that you can use to customise your weapon.Though it's derivative, it's good entertainment. The environments look fantastic, the story is decent, and you meet some interesting characters. There's a rebel who cut herself off from the force for mysterious reasons, there's a gruff and expressive captain with four arms\u2014all the better for flying spaceships with. There's also a little robot called BD-1. He's kind of baby Wall-E who sits on your back and warbles. Tap up on the D-pad and he shoots a healing stim out of his head. BD-1 acts as Cal's foil for most of the adventure, and in spite of his bland appearance, I ended up liking Cal for his ongoing chats with his little robot pal. You can put level-up points into BD-1's abilities too. Some help you traverse, others let you attack enemies in new ways. It feels good to hack those evil-looking Imperial probe bots.The story follows the typical beats you'd expect from a tale following the fortunes of an aspiring Jedi, but the game also manages to sneak in interesting parts of Star Wars' rich extended universe. On the moody planet, Dathomir, the force exists, but is used in very different ways.Another treat for Star Wars fans, then, but I would recommend Fallen Order to anyone who enjoys moreish third person action games like Darksiders. The formula is similar, but it's a great way to deliver a fun space adventure with some silly puzzles and very satisfying lightsaber combat.Unfortunately the game has some performance problems on PC. Some of my colleagues and I experienced quite serious stuttering, particularly when the game seemed to be loading in new areas. The problem was serious enough to break up the flow of an otherwise well-paced game, and mid-combat stutters got me killed in combat a few times. Though the framerate was otherwise smooth for me, others have been experiencing dips at points. Hopefully patches will come in future, but for now it's an unfortunate blemish on a decent game.I still enjoyed myself, though. It's a good game that's definitely worth playing, which happens to be exactly the description of the 70s bracket in our review policy. It's a fun, straightforward holiday adventure.

What a wonderful feeling to finally plunge into a Star Wars game with carefully-crafted alien worlds, references to delight die-hard fans, and new lore to expand that galaxy far, far away. Since EA acquired the licence for Star Wars games in 2013, fans have been desperate for a really good story - and an enormous amount of hope has been riding on this game. On paper, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order seems to fit the bill. It's a single-player title combining Soulsborne combat, Uncharted climbing and Metroidvania level design to create something that's uniquely its own. As a true melting pot of many of the best features of modern and retro gaming alike, I initially thought Respawn might be onto a winner. Yet despite a glowing start, the game has problems sustaining its momentum in terms of both game design and narrative - eventually sagging into a tedious grind with a lacklustre finish. And, on top of that, there's a raft of performance issues on Xbox One. If only it could have kept that charm going. Fallen Order takes place five years after the events of Revenge of the Sith and the infamous Order 66. The Jedi Order has been destroyed, as have nearly all the Jedi - but at least one remains in the form of protagonist Cal Kestis, a former Padawan who's in hiding as a scrapper on the planet of Bracca. Due to events outside his control, Cal is forced to reveal his powers, and only escapes the Empire's inquisitors with the help of two mysterious individuals, a woman called Cere and a reluctant green alien named Greez, who whisk him away to rebuild the Jedi Order. It's a fair premise for a story, and the game's opening action sequences through the industrial metal constructs of Bracca are pure heart-pounding thrills. Once you're out the opening stages, you're led to the main thrust of the game: venturing between various planets to complete the main story objectives and new skills, alongside finding additional pick-ups and cosmetics to decorate Cal, your ship, your droid BD-1 and your lightsaber. It's a neat system that gives players a fair amount of freedom, while keeping the levels tight enough for choreographed action sequences. I'm pleased to report the outdoor areas in one of the earliest planets, Zeffo, are still as brilliant as when I played them earlier this year, and show Fallen Order at its best. Well-paced combat, beautiful vistas, epic music and fantastic environmental design make it a joy to play, successfully striking that balance of exploration and challenging gameplay. The routes are winding but navigable, and at this point the environmental puzzles revolve around mobility and timing your use of force powers, such as freezing an object to climb on it. I spent a great deal of time scanning and reading data entries to learn more about Zeffo, piecing together a picture of what the empire did there. Fallen Order's environmental storytelling is intricate and detail-oriented, focused on something previously given little airtime in Star Wars: the impact of the empire's war machine, and how it touches even small communities on every planet in the galaxy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9bcb34c4-d676-460a-87d5-f1fd9f535c7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "9bcb34c4-d676-460a-87d5-f1fd9f535c7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "09c8914b-efb7-4841-b409-c80e50c979eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fefb7afff6f169b66afb183ac456cd82000e85f24f2d8de6e89c215adbcb8210"}, "3": {"node_id": "8714cc07-eb7d-485d-b362-5ba9f40d9242", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0721401bfea4d3106a4fb430bd270299352d16fcece829112bca6fb3b8968f68"}}, "hash": "543adfb66f1283dc63239a3e2c212716bd90ea9c35189048806b8ddf1b9d99ef", "text": "To balance things out, I also found myself chuckling at small details such as enemy placement: two rat-like creatures can immediately be found pulling on a dead stormtrooper's legs (dark humour, I know), while another leaps on a stormtrooper to push him over the edge. In fact, I could probably write an entire article about the stormtroopers alone. Respawn's done an incredible job of bringing these enemies to life, to a point where I felt genuinely bad for killing some of them - perhaps inadvertently creating one of the better moral questions in Fallen Order. At this point in Star Wars lore, troopers are conscripts, not clones, and you can hear the variety of attitudes towards their work when sneaking around ahead of a fight. Some exhibit a kind of fascist bro attitude towards their jobs (and purge troopers display a zealous desire to fulfill their purpose by killing Jedi), but many are just in the middle of regular conversations: expressing how they don't want to end up on garbage duty, how they didn't sleep the night before - another complaining to an officer that their potential is being wasted on a barren planet. Mid-fight, some of them will sarcastically remark about being the last one standing, or voice hesitation at taking on a Jedi. The mundanity of the conversations and honesty of their reactions makes them both comical and relatable - and there's at least one high ground joke to satisfy r/PrequelMemes. Sorry, back to Zeffo: the furrowed landscapes also provide an excellent stage for Fallen Order's combat, giving players room to breathe between encounters, and largely leaving a fair but challenging amount of time between meditation spots (effectively save points). If that sounds familiar, it's because it is: Fallen Order uses a combat system that leans heavily on From Software games, with an emphasis on timed parries, dodges, and using tactics tailored to each of the diverse set of enemies, whose patterns of attack (including unblockable attacks) you'll have to memorise. Resting at meditation points allows you to heal and reset your health stims - but doing this also respawns enemies, so you'll have to consider whether it's worth risking the hop to the next one. If that ends badly, you'll drop whatever XP you've racked up from killing enemies on the enemy that defeated you. In turn, damaging this golden glowing enemy then restores your life, a nice little boost in a tough fight. That XP eventually turns into skill points, which can be spent in Fallen Order's skill tree to unlock various abilities and perks. It's divided into three branches: force, lightsaber and survival - with new combat abilities made available for purchase as the story progresses and Cal learns new skills. It's more a matter of prioritising which abilities you want first (rather than customising to your specific playstyle), as by the end of the game most of the main skills will be available. As a Souls-like game, the inevitable question is: how hard is it? Thankfully Fallen Order gives four difficulty options: Story, Jedi Knight, Jedi Master and Jedi Grandmaster, with the harder modes narrowing your parrying window and increasing enemy aggression, and Cal taking more damage. I mainly played on the recommended difficulty, Jedi Knight, which does a good job of balancing challenge with accessibility for players unused to tough melee combat (although there are some difficulty spikes in late-game boss fights). I also had a go at wandering around on Jedi Grandmaster, and enjoyed the challenge in short bursts - but I think playing the entire game like that would take a level of concentration that is beyond me. Each to their own. At least if you do get sick of a certain boss, you can effectively skip it with Story Mode, yet I wouldn't recommend playing the whole game this way as it eliminates all challenge.  For the most part, the combat is solid: you have to exercise patience and think about the order in which to tackle groups of enemies (particularly when some are ranged), and which tactics will take down an enemy as fast as possible. Correctly timing a parry to open an enemy to a cinematic finishing move is incredibly satisfying, and I also became a serial force-pusher by routinely shoving enemies off edges (although you can't do this with bigger enemies - there is a limit to the cheesing). Playing blaster bolt tennis with a viper droid is ridiculous, and therefore great. Yet the fun doesn't last: thus begins Fallen Order's turn to the dark side. One of Fallen Order's big selling points is its Metroidvania influence - namely, the use of myriad unfolding paths that unlock as you acquire new abilities, with a level map to help players navigate (green means the route is unlocked, red is a no-no). It's simultaneously the game's biggest asset, and biggest flaw - a double-edged lightsaber, if you will.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8714cc07-eb7d-485d-b362-5ba9f40d9242": {"__data__": {"id_": "8714cc07-eb7d-485d-b362-5ba9f40d9242", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "9bcb34c4-d676-460a-87d5-f1fd9f535c7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "543adfb66f1283dc63239a3e2c212716bd90ea9c35189048806b8ddf1b9d99ef"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7d29d10-7662-441b-b817-2ccc891962c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "000f41cf52de7f2eda3383250353276372a8539ae71bd7cbac5058030bf0d184"}}, "hash": "0721401bfea4d3106a4fb430bd270299352d16fcece829112bca6fb3b8968f68", "text": "Once you've initially explored a brand new planet, retraversal to find bonus pick-ups and cosmetics is great: you're excited to explore the nooks and crannies, everything's fresh, and you're willing to spend that time because you're the person initiating the optional exploring. At that point, too, the maps are small enough that it doesn't take an age to hike them. In the middle of the game, however, the story objectives ask you to revisit the same few planets - and this is when the Metroidvania elements become incredibly tedious. The objectives are normally placed beyond everything you've already explored, which is a long way to walk. While you can unlock shortcuts, these are often hard to spot in the all-blue, complicated level maps, and are no longer marked in the bright yellow colour that indicates an unexplored area. In any case, most shortcuts aren't significant enough to make a big dent in travel time. With the buzz of exploring a new world now gone, you have a lot less patience to go back through complicated winding tunnels. Then, once you've completed your objective, the worst part of all: you have to trek back to the ship, a process which can take over 20 minutes of hacking your way through enemies you've already defeated. Even Dark Souls eventually gets a fast travel option about 2/3rds of the way through, and Fallen Order is crying out for something similar.The one thing that could have inspired me to keep grinding through all this would have been the promise of gripping story developments. But alas, there's very little there. In the process of writing this review I had to return to the game's chapter notes, as most of the story developments had turned to soup in my head. You're constantly being ferried between the ship and the objective, chasing the holotapes of a dead Jedi to collect stuff, in order to collect more stuff. It's a never-ending breadcrumb trail with no emotional payoff. Amidst my descent into boredom, something else was happening - something dark and terrible. My game was breaking. As I reached jungle-heavy planet Kashyyyk, the framerate took a hammering. This often happened at combat-heavy points: not ideal when you're trying to time a parry. I started experiencing freezes, and then the crashes arrived. I've never heard an Xbox scream before, but I heard that noise twice in one day.As I moved away from Krashyyyk, the holodeck started acting up (the equipment required to travel), with the framerate slowing to less than one per second. I coaxed it into working by opening and closing the Xbox menu, but eventually even that stopped working. I was forced to move onto Xbox One X, as it had utterly broken on base Xbox One. The game is receiving a day one patch, so we'll see how well this fixes things - and Digital Foundry is working on some more in-depth analysis. At the heart of the narrative problems lies one key issue: I simply don't care about any of the characters. Cal has the personality of a wet poncho. Many of his conversations result in him essentially saying little more than yes/no, or remarking on the mission objective. The best it gets is the odd joke with BD-1, and although Cere has a more interesting backstory, neither she nor Cal are particularly dynamic - and their conversations, which make up the bulk of the dialogue in Fallen Order, are just dull. I found myself totally alienated from his character, and instead wishing I could be hanging out on the other side of the laser gate with the Second and Ninth Sisters, who actually have a hint of personality and deliciously evil dialogue. Of course, there's no option to make dark side decisions in this game (Cal never even contemplates it) and unfortunately you only see the villains when they pop up in boss battles. Pity. More than anything, aside from the way in which some of the story moments are visually presented, there's nothing clever about the story. Themes of failure and dealing with guilt and trauma are thrown around, but never explored in any depth. The game just doesn't allow time for it. The other characters remain on the ship, so you're normally stuck with Cal's bland exchanges with his droid - while the cutscenes are all business, all about the next objective. Thank god for Greez, who is the only one with consistently humorous and engaging dialogue - but one character cannot carry a story. When Greez tells Cal his actions have changed his outlook on life, it's incredibly jarring, as none of the necessary groundwork has been laid before that point. It's just not believable. Ultimately, Fallen Order has a story that barely develops. It's a story without clear direction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7d29d10-7662-441b-b817-2ccc891962c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7d29d10-7662-441b-b817-2ccc891962c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "8714cc07-eb7d-485d-b362-5ba9f40d9242", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0721401bfea4d3106a4fb430bd270299352d16fcece829112bca6fb3b8968f68"}, "3": {"node_id": "b490733a-8790-46a9-951e-cbf5ef54082c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "90ffe06d75da89b781dbcbe54401e61e040e5180ba5ff05486ebab401b862333"}}, "hash": "000f41cf52de7f2eda3383250353276372a8539ae71bd7cbac5058030bf0d184", "text": "It's a story without clear direction. It's a story without risk.  It all makes Fallen Order a slog. I was tired of wading through waves of enemies, only to find no interesting story at the end, and unable to skip through levels quickly: even running past in story mode ends up with you getting whacked, shot off ropes, or stuck at doors with an enemy mob in hot pursuit. Maybe the Soulsborne format just isn't the best fit for Star Wars. In order to provide challenge, enemies have to be struck several times - and this has the effect of making lightsabers feel underpowered. Perhaps it makes sense when Cal is at the beginning of his journey, but even when Cal is at his most powerful, it takes about three slashes to down an overgrown rat. Lightsaber fights also feel less epic with Cal flopping on the floor while you're trying to figure out an enemy's attack pattern. You do get more abilities and skills, and you can increase your HP and force, but Fallen Order never lets you take the gloves off. The reason behind limiting your force meter is to make players engage with the fast-parrying melee combat, as you restore the meter through killing enemies (or hitting blocked ones, if you unlock that perk). The retraversal issue would have been significantly lessened if you could simply rampage through enemies when returning to a planet. What fun it would have been to let loose with Cal's force powers, and a hard-hitting lightsaber.  When I reached the end of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, I didn't feel like I'd had a rewarding experience. I was relieved it was over. With some side-meandering, it took around 30 hours, and I didn't enjoy a lot of them. I'll admit crunching a Souls-like in less than four days is an unnatural and gruelling experience: I imagine if I'd played Fallen Order over several months, I would have been less frustrated, but probably still bored. It's such a shame, as Fallen Order has an incredible gameplay experience at its core, with fantastic environments and well-directed action sequences. Yet it's unable to sustain this thanks to some fundamental design problems. As for the story?

The only consoles games they\u2019ve managed to produce in that time are Battlefront I and II, which while as competent as you\u2019d expect from the makers of Battlefield are only ever going to be remembered for the second one\u2019s industry-changing abuse of loot boxes. Which means for many Fallen Order will be seen as EA\u2019s first \u2018proper\u2019 Star Wars game.Although Fallen Order is by Titanfall and Apex Legends developer Respawn it\u2019s been made by a newly formed team led by God Of War III director Stig Asmussen. There are a few echoes of Kratos\u2019 original trilogy in the game but there are other much more obvious inspirations behind Fallen Order, namely Dark Souls/Bloodborne, Uncharted, and The Legend Of Zelda. That\u2019s a heady mix of big-name games but an even more important influence is the Metrodivania genre, which defines the Fallen Order\u2019s structure and creates some of its biggest problems.Metroidvanias (a portmanteau of Metroid and Castlevania) are very common as indie games but almost unknown when it comes to big budget 3D games. Fallen Order suggests a few reasons for that, but at first it all seems like a welcome contrast from the linear, undemanding licensing exercise you might have expected. Although the first surprise is that, even more so than Battlefront, this has nothing to do with the new movies and is instead set five years after Revenge Of The Sith, when the Empire is scouring the galaxy for the last remaining Jedi.You play the game as an inexperienced Padawan named Cal Kestis, who together with an ex-Jedi Master and her pilot friend, are on the run from Imperial Inquisitors. Cal starts the game knowing the basics of lightsaber combat but what amounts to PTSD has left him unable to perform any of the other normal Jedi feats.Combat works something like Bloodborne, with a light and heavy attack and a significant reliance on parrying and countering, which also helps replenish your Force power.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61da8080-c7c6-481e-bf03-d0da2856b21f": {"__data__": {"id_": "61da8080-c7c6-481e-bf03-d0da2856b21f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "b490733a-8790-46a9-951e-cbf5ef54082c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "90ffe06d75da89b781dbcbe54401e61e040e5180ba5ff05486ebab401b862333"}, "3": {"node_id": "755bc8f0-ac74-4e95-8648-f66a1551a25f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "eb56d7e5607ff72c3ef89937e6cf3f3c6eb577ffac965c7641997ca6595a0d60"}}, "hash": "6d473d6c82704f1fd633ad863e15eeaa3bb879eea272a318291c67cd60a6d758", "text": "The visual feedback on whether you\u2019ve successfully parried or not can sometimes be a little vague, but other than that it manages a good compromise between the need to look like the movies and works as a video game.An actual lightsaber fight is rare but for some reason even Scout Troopers are armed with melee weapons and it\u2019s a long time before you get any kind of proper long-range attack. Fallen Order is only as difficult as Soulsborne games on the hardest setting but it\u2019s still no pushover even on the default, while the only way to save and unlock new abilities via your skill tree are at what are essentially bonfires \u2013 which refill your stock of health potions (sorry, stimpacks) while also respawning all minor enemies.That obviously makes no sense in the context of the Star Wars universe but the game just rolls with it, the most Soulsborne-esque elements treated almost as a badge of honour and proof that this is a legitimate video game and not a quick cash-in. Although there\u2019s quite a bit of platforming it all works essentially identically to Uncharted and so requires little real skill to navigate, just a sharp eye to keep track of all the navigable ledges.At the start, your main Force ability is to briefly slow down your perception of time, but as you progress you learn to push and pull through the Force, which amongst other things expands the range of puzzles \u2013 the most complex of which take place in Zelda-esque dungeons. They\u2019re nowhere near as complex or varied as the best Zeldas but, unlike most other mainstream games, they do require real thought (or a hint from your droid) and that\u2019s to their credit.Despite the potential of the setting, one of the main problems with Fallen Order is that its plot lacks any sense of urgency. Although it\u2019s easy to forget, the main goal is to find a Jedi Holocron that contains the detail of all remaining Force-sensitive children, which involves, for reasons we\u2019re still a little hazy on, following a series of architectural clues left by an ancient civilisation. None of that is interesting but what should be is the plight of Cal and his friends, but it\u2019s almost impossible to care about such dull characters.The dialogue throughout the game is exhaustingly bland but Cal in particular lacks anything approaching a personality trait. The villains have a few good moments but the storytelling throughout is superficial and obvious. The game also struggles to come up with any new concepts that don\u2019t sound like either fan fiction or generic sci-fi, to the point that we ended up looking back at Battlefront II\u2019s story mode with unexpected nostalgia.Many great games have failed to impress in terms of storytelling though, so that\u2019s not necessarily a fatal flaw, and we should emphasise that Fallen Order is by no means a bad game. But what finally prevents it from being a great one is how it handles backtracking. Backtracking is a key element of any Metroidvania game, where you return to old locations with new abilities that allow you to progress past previously impassable obstacles. Fallen Order is filled with moments like that and yet, incredibly, there\u2019s no fast travel at all.Even Dark Souls has fast travel so not including it here is baffling. As if traipsing backwards and forwards across the massive maps wasn\u2019t bad enough the journey back to your ship, which is the only way off planet in any of the levels, always involves an especially turgid journey that frequently takes upwards of 15 minutes and usually serves no useful gameplay or storytelling purpose.Picking gameplay mechanics and structural concepts off the shelf like this, and not adapting or iterating on them in any way, is extremely unwise, especially given the very specific Star Wars setting. The game inevitably becomes a patchwork of other people\u2019s ideas, with the level design and geography feeling highly contrived for what is supposed to be a relatively grounded sci-fi universe.The Force might be space magic, but the straight fantasy of Zelda and Dark Souls allows those games to handwave away contrivances in the gameplay and level layout in a way that just doesn\u2019t make sense here.It\u2019s a real shame because, despite some so-so facial animation and occasional slowdown, the graphics are great and there\u2019s tons of content, with lots of secrets to discover long after the 15-odd hours of the main story are over.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "755bc8f0-ac74-4e95-8648-f66a1551a25f": {"__data__": {"id_": "755bc8f0-ac74-4e95-8648-f66a1551a25f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "61da8080-c7c6-481e-bf03-d0da2856b21f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d473d6c82704f1fd633ad863e15eeaa3bb879eea272a318291c67cd60a6d758"}, "3": {"node_id": "fd1cb4ec-7e23-4d03-9999-0e4d8ed87e3e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6a19a59ddca4cae2bd2f25a893ca2a16eca60b41a2bd0bfb5584582af5260f8"}}, "hash": "eb56d7e5607ff72c3ef89937e6cf3f3c6eb577ffac965c7641997ca6595a0d60", "text": "Most of the individual elements are fun too, but they don\u2019t gel together into a coherent whole and instead degenerate into an increasingly frustrating and repetitive one.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader\u2019s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepIt doesn\u2019t help that the telekinetic powers in Remedy\u2019s Control are a lot more enjoyable than this, with the need to be authentic to Star Wars canon stopping the game from offering more outrageous abilities. Or maybe it\u2019s just the story Respawn has chosen to tell; whose vapid characters commit that one crime that not even the prequels were guilty of: they\u2019re completely forgettable.The ending purposefully sets up the potential for sequels and given how close this comes to greatness we\u2019d certainly like to see that happen. But the challenges of making both a good game and a good Star Wars experience are extreme and it\u2019s unsurprising that so few games manage to balance both sides of the equation. Being a Jedi isn\u2019t supposed to be easy, but we would\u2019ve liked it to be a bit more fun than this.In Short: An earnest attempt to create the ultimate Jedi simulator but the mishmash of game influences and an unengaging story leaves it only impacting on the surface.Pros: Some of the best lightsaber combat ever and a large, single-player adventure full of secrets. Surprisingly involved puzzles at times, with great graphics and presentation.Cons: Contrived level layout and poorly handled backtracking. Lack of fast travel is madness. Boring characters and plot.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is more than the laser sword that Cal swings through whole platoons of stormtroopers, but that's the main reason people will come to Respawn's adventure, and it's the reason they'll stay with it. Whether it's hurling it at the creatures you'll face or flicking bolt blasters back at Imperial troopers, it's a strong realisation of what a lightsaber should feel like. \u00a0But, it's not the star of the show. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is at its best when it's a cross between fighting and being on a Star Wars safari, as you explore dense planets that are teeming with hidden areas, lore, and other secrets for you to unearth. It's these large playgrounds that leave the biggest impression as you take aspiring Jedi Cal Kestis on a journey to restore the Jedi Order.Release Date: November 15, 2019Platforms: PS4, Xbox One, and PCDeveloper: Respawn EntertainmentPublisher: EAFallen Order's story kicks off on Bracca, a scrapping planet where workers harvest Republic ships for the Empire. The Jedi Order have been wiped out following Order 66, and as a survivor of it, Cal is laying low as a worker for the Scrapper Guild. His anonymity doesn't last long though, as a workplace incident sees him inadvertently revealing his powers to the Empire and a deadly Inquisitor called The Second Sister. After a messy escape from Bracca, Cal sets off on a quest to restart the Jedi Order.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd1cb4ec-7e23-4d03-9999-0e4d8ed87e3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd1cb4ec-7e23-4d03-9999-0e4d8ed87e3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "755bc8f0-ac74-4e95-8648-f66a1551a25f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "eb56d7e5607ff72c3ef89937e6cf3f3c6eb577ffac965c7641997ca6595a0d60"}, "3": {"node_id": "3f44db03-453f-4033-9427-8e4d6d716841", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a05f88f063c7bf111b0b6975b3479d762e27f6501be2725b7d80f3fb444d11b"}}, "hash": "f6a19a59ddca4cae2bd2f25a893ca2a16eca60b41a2bd0bfb5584582af5260f8", "text": "It's a frantic opening that suggests an Uncharted-esque adventure is instore \u2013 an early set-piece involving a moving train offers strong supporting evidence for this \u2013 yet Fallen Order is so much more than that. It's also a planet-spanning metroidvania, where equipment or skills you discover on one level unlock new paths in an earlier one. On top of that, it's a demanding melee slasher that has plenty in common with this year's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, as well as boasting some Tomb Raider-style environmental puzzling that will flex your Jedi skills in ways that don't involve throwing stormtroopers over cliffs (sadly). While the game's influences can be seen on Cal's poncho from a mile off, they're woven together in a way that never comes across as derivative. \u00a0That starts with the combat, which is deliberately paced to put an emphasis on waiting for the right moment to strike. The From Software influence is clear in how you should engage enemies cautiously, with your finger hovering over the block button at all times, but Fallen Order is demanding rather than punishing. Patience may be required in every fight, (and bosses are nowhere near as hair-yankingly tough as the ones you tackle in Sekiro) but that comes with the reward of feeling like you're a space samurai carving through anyone foolish enough to get in your way. Plus, difficulty options allow you to fine tune your experience, from players who want to focus on the story, to those craving a sterner test, which is a welcome way of easing the tension if you start to get frustrated.\u00a0Then there are Cal's Force powers. At the start of the game, Cal has the ability to slow down his enemies; handy, but limited. As you discover powers throughout the story, you start to find ways of making them work together to do some grin-inducing attacks \u2013 pausing a blaster bolt and pulling an enemy into it is great fun, as is pushing a rocket straight back into the trooper who fired it at you. One of the combat's great joys is discovering how you can make Cal's Force skills work together and the game's steady stream of new powers keeps you experimenting throughout.\u00a0Not that you'll be able to stroll through levels hurling enemies over edges to your heart's content. A Force power meter keeps your abilities in check, making you think about how and when you'll use them. That's so you engage with the core lightsaber combat rather than just force yanking every single thing you see into your lightsaber (although it must be said, that never gets old). If Fallen Order's stated aim is to make you feel like Jedi then, at its balletic best, the combat manages it. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The deliberate pace of the combat is mirrored when it comes to exploring the planets that make up the game's levels. This isn't a game where you're rushing through linear levels, hurtling along a single path and through story beats. Instead, these are large planets with plenty to discover on them, and while you'll never feel the need to rush through them, the gear gating means there's also plenty of reasons to frequently revisit.\u00a0For instance, an early planet you head to, Zeffo, seems big on your first visit, but it's only when you return to really dig into it do you realise how intricate it is. A crash site that you'll need to stray down some off-beaten paths to find leads you towards a Venator Wreck. When I first discover it, I can only scout around the outside of the ship, but once I unlocked the Jedi Flip (read: double jump) later on, I was able to journey deeper into the ship, discovering handy upgrades for Cal alongside lore about how the gigantic ship had ended up as wreckage on Zeffo.\u00a0These types of moments, where you return to an area you thought you had explored thoroughly only for it to spool out in an intriguing new direction, are the ones where Fallen Order makes the biggest impression. Not only does it give you a chance to explore corners of Star Wars in a tangible way that recent games haven't, but they feel like places rather than well-decorated sets. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While there aren't too many planets in the game \u2013 six in total, although you'll spend more time on some than others \u2013 each has its own distinct identity. Kashyyyk's verdant forests and jungle seem to stretch out over huge areas, while Dathomir is a harsh and intricate maze, where you'll end up trying to navigate through it's swampy depths.\u00a0There aren't many downsides to poking around these corners of the galaxy, but there are a couple of little niggles. The main one is that platforming can be imprecise, especially before you unlock the Jedi Flip.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f44db03-453f-4033-9427-8e4d6d716841": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f44db03-453f-4033-9427-8e4d6d716841", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd1cb4ec-7e23-4d03-9999-0e4d8ed87e3e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f6a19a59ddca4cae2bd2f25a893ca2a16eca60b41a2bd0bfb5584582af5260f8"}, "3": {"node_id": "1d7977a2-d763-43a2-87df-750aa61eee1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6659a2018317d47f4ab20239cc145ca68216b66d5ca85141b9c823cb2fa54256"}}, "hash": "9a05f88f063c7bf111b0b6975b3479d762e27f6501be2725b7d80f3fb444d11b", "text": "On more than a few occasions, I ended up leaping into the abyss because I didn't quite line up my jump right. Still, the level and visual design of planets are the game's unexpected highlights. \u00a0If wandering around these planets on the hunt for secrets is one of the game's strongest points, the story that sets you on this path isn't quite as compelling. Simply put, the cat-and-mouse tale that's set up at the beginning quickly moves into a hunt for a Very Important Object that only really starts to engage in the final third. \u00a0Fortunately, the characters help keep the journey entertaining. Cal isn't the most complex of leads, but his endless earnestness slowly won me around to him. Similarly, while his crew might be archetypes \u2013 one's a wise mentor and the other is a grumpy pilot \u2013 they make for good company as you go planet hopping. Greez, the aforementioned grump, especially becomes more loveable as he warms to his new mates. \u00a0There's two standouts though, and that's the adorably chirpy BD-1 and the deliciously villainous Second Sister. Not only is BD-1 extremely handy throughout your adventure, as it learns how to ride ziplines, power up generators, and hack droids, but the little bot gets a surprisingly full backstory that only endears you more to it. However, the Second Sister is the game's most fascinating character. I won't take you into Spoiler City, but if she initially appears one-note, her overall arc is the game's most well-realised. Plus, it's hard not to enjoy her ripping the piss out of Cal whenever they cross 'sabers, so she earns bonus points for that.\u00a0There's plenty to like about Fallen Order, but it should come with the caveat that it's slightly rougher than I was expecting. I've played the entire game on PS4 Pro and glitches and framerate stuttering have cropped up enough to warrant mentioning. One patch has already been released before launch, and EA has told us that another is on the way, but it did give my initial playthrough a rougher-than-ideal feel.\u00a0Still, even if this isn't the most polished Star Wars game we've seen, it's also the first one in years that comes closest to capturing the magic of the series. Battlefront looked like Star Wars. Fallen Order, with an endearing earnestness that mirrors its heroes, gets what makes the series special. It's in the glimpses of strange worlds and cultures we want to learn more about, it's enjoying the ragtag groups who slowly learn to trust each other, and it's the fact that lightsabers are really great fun. Especially when you get them right.\u00a0Hello, I'm GamesRadar's News Editor.

Respawn has made a game that is every bit as ambitious, and despite showing a little sloppiness in execution, is an enthralling and fully featured Star Wars experience, hitting with a commanding bang in its cinematic presentation, environmental exploration, and journey shared between a Jedi and his droid.The first shot of the game sets the tone for the entire adventure. We see a junkyard filled with giant derelict starships being dismantled by the Empire for parts. TIE fighters roar into view, and the camera pans to show the immense scale of this sequence. The detail showcased in this moment is impressive, looking like an expensive shot from a new Star Wars film. The orchestration that swells is also reminiscent of John Williams\u2019 work, again making it feel like an epic cinematic experience.Just when it would seem Respawn is following George Lucas\u2019 formula, the soundtrack switches to something different with a throaty alien singer that doesn\u2019t sound like typical Star Wars. We then meet protagonist Cal Kestis, who is listening to this strange song through a pair of headphones as he works. This moment screams of something new, which Jedi: Fallen Order embraces fully. As the game unfolds, you see stormtroopers, a few familiar faces, and a Jedi learning the ways of the Force, but we see these iconic elements through the lens of new characters, worlds, and story ideas.Cal is immediately likeable as a conflicted soul, and is brought to life wonderfully by actor Cameron Monaghan. Cal\u2019s cohort, a droid named BD-1, is equally as fun to get to know, resembling a friendly lapdog more than any other droid in Star Wars. They have a playful banter and experience hardships with one another, and their bond forms the foundation for a hell of an adventure. They explore ancient shrines looking for clues that could hold the answer to resurrecting the Jedi Order. The mystery keeps the story engaging, as does the well-defined threat of the Inquisitors, Jedi-slayers who are hunting Cal and always seem to be one step ahead of him. Excellently penned flashbacks are sewn into this nicely paced narrative to add extra dimensions to the characters and conflict at hand.The one area where the story stumbles is in revisiting previously explored worlds for narrative reasons. As exciting as it is to dive deep into Dathomir\u2019s witch tombs or see the untamed beauty of Kashyyyk, the reasons to return to these planets often seem like a bit of a stretch. The thinking is along the lines of \u201cThe door\u2019s locked. Oh well. Let\u2019s leave and see if we can find a way to open it on another planet.\u201d That said, I enjoyed veering off of the story path to explore worlds on my own, since players can freely go to whichever one they want.Jedi: Fallen Order\u2019s most dynamic and entertaining quality is exploration. Cal begins with basic human abilities, but quickly remembers how to run along walls, double jump, and use the Force to push and pull objects. He taps into his gifts to navigate treacherous ground in finely crafted open environments filled with soaring verticality, snaking paths, and plenty of thrilling platforming and combat challenges. Cal\u2019s acrobatic movements are reliable and easy to read, and should you fall, the game doesn\u2019t punish you. You just take some damage and get another shot. Most of Cal\u2019s actions fit into the Jedi playbook, but Respawn went a little too far in its attempts to create dynamic action, like lengthy Super Mario 64-like slippery slopes and odd gelatinous bouncy pads that don\u2019t really scream \u201cStar Wars.\u201d It gets a little too gamey in these moments.Although you spend some time retracing steps through environments, shortcuts are placed in convenient spots and most areas are filled with secrets galore, such as additional stim canisters, outfits and ponchos for Cal, and paint schemes for BD-1 and the crew\u2019s ship, the Stinger Mantis. The stim canisters are incredibly valuable, as the game is challenging (even on the default difficulty) and I usually found my health to be in the red, hoping another checkpoint was nearby.Combat isn\u2019t the central focus of Jedi: Fallen Order, and I was surprised (and pleased) that Respawn didn\u2019t throw in encounters just to up the intensity at times. Stretches of play are without them and that pacing works well for the adventure aspects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50a2528d-6703-49c0-b30c-80472ff5bf02": {"__data__": {"id_": "50a2528d-6703-49c0-b30c-80472ff5bf02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d7977a2-d763-43a2-87df-750aa61eee1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6659a2018317d47f4ab20239cc145ca68216b66d5ca85141b9c823cb2fa54256"}, "3": {"node_id": "444583ee-ffaa-4fff-913a-daf6cbc4fa85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "920057495a99210cb315c8f20bc2e4166d6df75d78b1a36f2a75ca7ebacbd093"}}, "hash": "6b4376151e18bf019a1e69a2b0a97c4cf7635e66a69ad996799701504b046387", "text": "Stretches of play are without them and that pacing works well for the adventure aspects. Battles are where the biggest thrills and problems reside. Swinging the lightsaber feels damn good; it\u2019s fast, powerful, feels dangerous, and delivers big results, like slicing rampaging beasts clean in two. Respawn\u2019s decision to make combat more of a defensive game also pays dividends in terms of strategy and flow. I like that the fights are deliberately paced, and allow for multiple targets to be engaged at once, such as exchanging lightsaber blows with a purge trooper and then in between swings using Force Push to send a rocket back at a stormtrooper. You don\u2019t just run into a room and start swinging. You strategize and pick at enemies carefully. Timing parries can be tricky, but should you succeed, reward you with a big hit or instant kill that looks amazing.The combat ideas are sound and lead to some awesome moments that make you feel like a true Jedi, but the enemies can throw kinks into your plans, as some of their movements are not telegraphed well, and you sometimes see animation hitches that can\u2019t be predicted, and make parry efforts next to impossible. Additionally, archers and snipers sometimes freeze up and won\u2019t fire at you, leading to a strange showdown where nothing is happening for 15 to 20 seconds. More troubling, I ran into numerous issues with BD-1 not healing me, although Cal audibly calls for it. Having this happen against the grueling end-game bosses was somewhat maddening. Given how many ledges are in most worlds, don\u2019t be surprised if a combat encounter is interrupted by Cal getting knocked off a cliff and then magically reappearing to lock sabers again. It\u2019s jarring, and speaks volumes to the combat being a little rough overall in terms of Cal's base movements. The visuals, while stunning in composition, can sometimes be affected by texture pop-in, lighting not displaying correctly, or enemies quickly dropping into place as a door is opened.Despite these numerous little problems, Respawn\u2019s maiden voyage with Star Wars is largely a success. I couldn\u2019t put this game down, both for the thrill of exploring and wanting to see where the story took me next. The inspirations taken from Dark Souls, Uncharted, and Metroid Prime unite to create something unique that just happens to work incredibly well for this beloved license. Like most starships in this universe, Jedi: Fallen Order could use a little polish, but the rust doesn\u2019t hold it back from roaring with excitement.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

Video games have gotten very good at capturing the aesthetic of Star Wars--the cold metallic angles of Imperial architecture, the powerful hum of a lightsaber, the electric snap of a blaster bolt hitting home--but can struggle to get beneath the surface. It's the rare Star Wars game that reaches beyond how Star Wars looks to explore what Star Wars is really about.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, the latest game in the canon, is one of the better offerings specifically because it tries to look beyond the trappings of Star Wars. It's not just another Jedi power fantasy, although wielding the Force with skill and resolve will certainly make you feel powerful. Like the best Star Wars games, it's one that adds to the ideas of the films and other material, exploring new corners of the galaxy while focusing on the core themes of the franchise: knowing yourself, fighting your own darkness, and braving adversity with the help of friends.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Video ReviewFriendship has always been one of the main drives of Star Wars, especially in the original film trilogy, and it's the core of what makes Jedi: Fallen Order work in both story and gameplay.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "444583ee-ffaa-4fff-913a-daf6cbc4fa85": {"__data__": {"id_": "444583ee-ffaa-4fff-913a-daf6cbc4fa85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "50a2528d-6703-49c0-b30c-80472ff5bf02", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b4376151e18bf019a1e69a2b0a97c4cf7635e66a69ad996799701504b046387"}, "3": {"node_id": "8450246c-51d1-4603-956f-1b80eb0d3233", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f65476258bb4c2cbc5763268763c1ae43faf4c1e0810043fc7a40f8a3d89cd1"}}, "hash": "920057495a99210cb315c8f20bc2e4166d6df75d78b1a36f2a75ca7ebacbd093", "text": "The primary relationship of the game is between Cal Kestis, a Jedi padawan in hiding in the aftermath of the Jedi Purge that took place in Revenge of the Sith, and BD-1, a droid entrusted with a secret mission by the Jedi Master that previously owned it. Once Cal and BD-1 meet, they become inseparable, working together as partners to solve puzzles in forgotten ruins, navigate alien environments, and beat back the Empire.The pair work throughout the game to complete a scavenger hunt created by BD's last companion, Master Cordova. Before he vanished, Cordova locked away a list of Force-sensitive children throughout the galaxy that could be used to resuscitate the destroyed Jedi Order and challenge the Empire. He left clues to how to retrieve that list hidden in BD, requiring Cal and the droid to travel to various worlds, following in Cordova's footsteps to free up BD's encrypted memories.Functionally, BD is Cal's constant companion as he rides around on the Jedi's back, and Cal regularly talks with the droid as they explore Fallen Order's planets. BD also serves several support functions in gameplay. Most importantly, BD provides Cal with \"stims\" that allow him to heal himself in the middle of Fallen Order's often-oppressive combat. He can also function as a zipline, unlock doors, and hack certain droid enemies to turn the tides of battle. BD is just enough a part of any given fight or puzzle that you're always aware of his presence and his help, but it's Cal's constant interactions with the little droid that really build out their relationship.You definitely need BD's help and the upgrades you find for him throughout your journey, because Fallen Order can be punishing. It lifts a number of gameplay ideas directly from the Soulsborne genre; enemies are often tough-as-nails and can deal big damage if you're complacent, whether they're Imperial stormtroopers taking potshots or two-foot rats leaping out of burrows to snap at Cal's throat. Fighting isn't just about wailing on everyone with your lightsaber, but rather relies heavily on blocking and carefully timed parries if you mean to stay alive against even the most run-of-the-mill foes. You and your enemies also have a stamina meter to manage, which dictates how many blows you can defend against before you stagger, and adds a strategic element to duels. To win a battle, you need to whittle down an enemy's stamina while blocking, parrying, and dodging to manage your own. Since every blow you sustain can be devastating, combat becomes an exciting, cerebral exercise in pretty much every case. You'll spend a lot of time not only honing your parrying skills, but also making quick battlefield decisions about how you can isolate dangerous enemies or use your Force powers to even up the odds.You can only heal from a limited number of stims or by resting at periodic meditation points, similar to Dark Souls' bonfires, and using them respawns all the enemies in the area, which makes being a smart combatant even more critical. Killing enemies and finding collectibles nets you experience, which accumulates into Skill Points you can spend on new abilities for Cal. But dying costs all the experience you earned since your last Skill Point unless you can find and damage the enemy who bested you.Though the elements of Fallen Order are Souls-like--it's probably most closely comparable to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, in fact--on most difficulty settings, it's far less brutal than From Software's games. Fallen Order might be considered Soulsborne-lite, making use of the same elements but to a different effect. It's tough, even occasionally frustrating, but not nearly so much as the games from which it draws its inspirations. That balance achieves something that feels essential to Fallen Order's identity: It makes you a powerful Jedi Knight, without turning you into an unstoppable Force-wielding superhero. Ratcheting back on the Jedi powers (and forcing you to unlock them as you work through the story and deal with Cal's past) helps Fallen Order's take on the Star Wars universe feel grounded and believable--a place where people could actually live.Your lack of overwhelming power also helps make the ever-looming Empire a frightening threat, even as individual soldiers comedically call out their own ineptitude in pretty much every battle. Cal spends the entire game hunted by the Inquisition, a subset of the Empire's forces specifically tasked with exterminating Jedi.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8450246c-51d1-4603-956f-1b80eb0d3233": {"__data__": {"id_": "8450246c-51d1-4603-956f-1b80eb0d3233", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "444583ee-ffaa-4fff-913a-daf6cbc4fa85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "920057495a99210cb315c8f20bc2e4166d6df75d78b1a36f2a75ca7ebacbd093"}, "3": {"node_id": "5767b1b9-96c1-48e7-86e6-71b004ff2f95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2417cb3e2633149a2df0d062fd74214c3396bd40f32b84d4aba233cb37f7a4a4"}}, "hash": "0f65476258bb4c2cbc5763268763c1ae43faf4c1e0810043fc7a40f8a3d89cd1", "text": "Because every fight is potentially deadly, running into the game's specially trained Purge Troopers is always an event, and you're forced not only test your lightsaber skills and timing, but to consider all the abilities at your disposal to make it out alive.The rest of the game often has to do with clambering around the environment and solving puzzles, not unlike Tomb Raider, God of War, or Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Navigating the world is as much about using observation and problem-solving skills as your Force tools. Respawn's Souls-inspired map design allows you to explore off the beaten path without ever really getting lost, and each planet is richly realized and fascinating to explore. The intricate pathways encourage you to wander off and visit each planet's varied environments to see what you might uncover, and Fallen Order always make sure you're rewarded with a bit of story, a cosmetic item, or even an optional miniboss fight.When you're between missions on planets, you're spending time with Fallen Order's two other major characters, Cere and Greez. They're the pair who manage to save Cal in the early hours of the game when his Jedi nature is discovered by the Empire, and they put him on the quest to find the list of Force-sensitives before the Inquisitors can get their hands on it. Though the story is a little rough in the early going as Cal is thrown directly into the quest with little lead-up or explanation, Fallen Order's story starts to excel around the halfway point as his relationships with BD, Cere, and Greez really start to develop. Once Fallen Order starts to invest in the interpersonal dynamics and deepening friendships of its cast, it really hits a stride--and its quest feels less like an elaborate series of tasks to fetch a MacGuffin, and more like an essential addition to the ongoing Star Wars saga.It does take Fallen Order a while to get there, though. The first few planets are a bit on the dull side, rushing to get Cal on his quest through the galaxy without really establishing why you should really care. Until it starts to click later in the game as you unlock more Force powers, combat can be a hassle, especially at certain boss battles or chokepoints, when your last meditation point is some distance away and you have to navigate through the same chunks of the map over and over. And while parrying is an essential part of the game, at higher difficulties, the timing can feel finicky and unreliable.The game also loves to throw handfuls of enemies at you all at once, which can be overwhelming, and combat against lower-tier enemies is built to lock you into finisher animations in a lot of cases. Instead of making you feel like a cool, well-trained warrior, these usually just leave you open to some Imperial dork wandering up with an electrobaton and clocking you in the head. It's only after you get enough Force powers to effectively control the crowds that these moments become more exciting than irritating. But throughout the game, there are always times when an enemy you couldn't see because of the game's tight targeting lock system gets in a cheap hit, forcing you to replay a fair stretch of its large, interweaving maps.But especially as it wears on, Fallen Order becomes perhaps the strongest conception of what playing as a Jedi Knight ought to really be like. It's true that Fallen Order borrows liberally from other action games, but those elements work together with Respawn's combat and environment design, and a story that finds humanity in the Force and in its characters, to hone in on what makes the world of Star Wars worthy of revisiting again and again. Even with some rough edges, Fallen Order represents one of the most compelling game additions to the Star Wars franchise in years.

I spend a lot of time with our hero, Cal Kestis, as he slides down funnels of ice \u2014 or hills of mud, on some planets \u2014 timing my jumps to get me to vines on which I can swing to another slide.

And then, slowly, across the next few hours, I began to warm to Jedi: Fallen Order, and then finally enjoy its charms, despite its flaws. It becomes one of the more interesting stories we\u2019ve seen in a Star Wars game, with enough twists and surprises to snare anyone who is a fan of the lore. Cal Kestis was a padawan \u2014 an apprentice Jedi \u2014 when Emperor Palpatine sent out Order 66, a command that began the Great Jedi Purge, wiping out the vast majority of the Jedi order in a few minutes. Kestis is forced to hide in a shipyard until he finds that he\u2019s being hunted by the Empire, near the same time he learns of a possible way to bring the Jedi back to the power they once enjoyed. But the Empire also has a few new ideas for how to track, and ultimately kill, the last remaining Jedi, and it begins to race Kestis for control of an object of great power. Jedi: Fallen Order answers the question of what happens to some of the few surviving Jedi, and their apprentices, when their support structure and governmental authority is wiped out. Suddenly, fighting with a lightsaber is nothing but an advertisement for their own death. Doing what it takes to survive in that environment is a major theme of the game, along with trying to make things better for the Jedi, if such a thing is even possible. Kestis is after a MacGuffin that may help him reclaim the Jedi order and restore it to some form of power. He\u2019s helped by a ship filled with the standard ragtag selection of gamblers and outcasts from the Star Wars universe, as well as a helpful and adorable droid named BD-1 who operates as his companion. BD-1 is played by Ben Burtt (the actual sound designer for the Star Wars movies) and has more personality and expression in his animation and vocalizations than Kestis is ever able to provide. In fact, all the side characters in the game are more interesting than Kestis, with their own failures, triumphs, and arcs that make me wish more time was spent on them instead of the bland hero we\u2019re stuck with. This is often a problem with mainline Star Wars properties, although the most recent films have done a much better job of not just focusing on the one chosen dude who comes from nowhere and is great because we\u2019re told he is. Kestis is a bit of a step backward, but at least the supporting cast and those you meet along the way are much more memorable than this eternally confused blank slate. What I actually do in Fallen Order is travel to a variety of planets, raid tombs, explore jungles, swim under the legs of AT-ATs, and try to stay one step ahead of the Empire. My companions stay in the ship during my adventures, for the most part, and it\u2019s up to me to explore each area to find clues about the next step in my quest. The most pressing challenge is almost always trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B, which is a refreshing shift for the Star Wars universe. There are battles, and some of them are glorious, but the vast majority of my time is spent solving puzzles and exploring, not fighting. I learn not to worry if I can\u2019t find all the secrets or access all the areas on each planet, because I can always go back when I\u2019ve unlocked a new Force ability or a higher jump to see more of each biome. It\u2019s a structure, and pace, that often feels lifted from Metroid games, in fact. This is all held back somewhat by technical issues, which plagued the game during the week I was playing before its release. Jedi: Fallen Order crashed on my Xbox One X multiple times, and another Polygon staffer reported similar crashes on PlayStation 4. There were often issues with dropped frames, and I would sometimes become stuck in a level\u2019s geometry, ultimately having to restart completely to escape. The first pre-release patch helped performance on the Xbox One somewhat, and an Electronic Arts representative said additional patches are on the way. But right now, Jedi: Fallen Order doesn\u2019t provide the level of performance, or even basic playability at some points, that I expect from a game of this stature.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74781159-a077-4a62-80f8-99c4b2793184": {"__data__": {"id_": "74781159-a077-4a62-80f8-99c4b2793184", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "5767b1b9-96c1-48e7-86e6-71b004ff2f95", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2417cb3e2633149a2df0d062fd74214c3396bd40f32b84d4aba233cb37f7a4a4"}, "3": {"node_id": "e76610f9-8ef6-4b0b-a302-4ea50484a411", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e53fb848e07a4469d5fe2442a2556b296324f0c13bada8ab2661a878a19deeb5"}}, "hash": "3addc07587aa82249e1a659498b50a2bc0447207960fca59b1f33ccbcc30d695", "text": "It definitely takes time for this structure to start working and paying off, although that payoff is there. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised at how satisfying the game becomes once I unlock a few upgrades and gain a greater mastery of my powers, making it possible to explore more of the map. \n    Related\n  And the more I explore, the better it gets. Jedi: Fallen Order begins to give up the grand, epic set-pieces that I want from a Star Wars game as I continue, including a stunning battle in which I lay siege to an AT-AT in a scene that feels like something out of Shadow of the Colossus. The smart mixture of exploration, classically designed puzzles built into huge underground or jungle-based structures, and Star Wars lore works far better than the first hour or two would indicate. And exploring each world to find every secret and aesthetic upgrade once you have all your abilities is surprisingly enjoyable. I also felt like I was being played with somewhat. In the aforementioned Shadow of the Colossus-like battle, the game briefly put me on a speeder bike ... and promptly asked me to hop off, since it can\u2019t be ridden. Why tease us with something like that?Anyway, Jedi: Fallen Order is a game about traveling through space on your own ship, trying to find your place in the galaxy, and exploring isolated, hard-to-reach environments through a variety of traversal options. Combat must take a back seat, right? No, it certainly doesn\u2019t.Combat is a bit dull, at first. All I have to work with are strikes, blocks, and rolls to escape attacks. It\u2019s rote, despite the inherent fun of wielding a glowing laser sword. But as I gain skill points and unlock abilities that expand what Kestis is capable of, I begin to feel not only competent, but dangerous. I can lock onto a single enemy and circle them, waiting for them to attack so I can roll out of the way and counter. I can use the Force to push a stormtrooper, screaming, off a cliff. I can slow down their attacks and move into a better position. I can pull enemies toward me, and then throw them back at their friends to break up groups. I can deflect blaster bolts with my lightsaber in between direct attacks. Juggling various attacks with different lightsaber styles, while paying attention to the limited amount of Force energy I have, is challenging but doable. Simple button presses for attacks make sense tactically, while the actual in-game animations make everything look fluid and choreographed. I have options; how I choose to fight is up to me, and it changes depending on the situation and the number of enemies. And those enemies ratchet up in intensity, from local wild animals to stormtroopers to specially trained anti-Jedi forces and then ... well, I\u2019d rather not spoil it. And the Empire was right to send enemies of this stature after me, because I become that monstrous of a threat. By the end of the game, I\u2019m a killing machine, with a huge range of options when it comes to messing up anyone who crosses me. And the fan service doesn\u2019t stop there; Jedi: Fallen Order features one of the best lightsaber customization systems I\u2019ve ever seen in a game, giving me the chance to pick the color of my blade, the material that makes up the hilt and its color, the emitters, the grips, and more. I unlock more and more options for my blade, and spend an embarrassing amount of time playing lightsaber dress-up and searching for more options for my blade. And then blades. Learning the ins and outs of the combat system is mandatory, unless I decide to play on the story-focused difficulty level. There are some long, technically challenging duels and battles throughout the game, including a few grueling moments where waves and waves of enemies are thrown at me. Learning how to finish off my equal in combat is satisfying, but Jedi: Fallen Order often relies on number of enemies for its challenge, which is less interesting. I skip a few of these moments by dropping down the difficulty level, and the game remains fun when I keep the challenge focused on exploration and cut through battalions of stormtroopers as if they were so much fodder. Even on the harder settings, learning how to double-jump through the air and run across a steel wall on an Imperial base before killing a stormtrooper with one blow \u2014 as one long, fluid action \u2014 feels amazing.  Which helps, because the way Jedi: Fallen Order handles death is strange, and doesn\u2019t seem to serve much of a narrative purpose.

Leveling up gives me points to use in the skill tree when I find glowing circles on which I meditate. But if I die before getting to one of these meditation spots, which let me cash in my character points, I lose those upgrade points as well as any experience I had built up. To retrieve those resources, I need to spawn at the last save point, find the enemy that killed me, and then hit them again. I\u2019m not sure what part of being a Jedi this Dark Souls-inspired death mechanic is supposed to simulate, but it feels strangely out of place in this game. It\u2019s not a spoiler to say that through all the Star Wars content available to date, we\u2019ve never heard the name Cal Kestis. The Jedi are not reformed in the most recent Star Wars films, which take place after the events of this game. He\u2019s going to fail in his task, and maybe die trying. So how do you create a story with actual stakes when we know the ultimate outcome of the quest? Jedi: Fallen Order mostly succeeds in pulling this off, and packs enough surprises to allow me to forget that I already know Kestis is bound to fail. Although it\u2019s trodding on somewhat known ground now, one of the most satisfying reveals during the game\u2019s finale is both ridiculously exciting and legitimately frightening. I may feel like a powerful Jedi by the end, but the truth is, I\u2019m still a kid with a lightsaber, and being reminded of that fact offers a satisfying payoff. There are much more powerful forces out there, and they\u2019re keenly aware of who I am and what I\u2019m doing. Setting a story with this much scope in this time period of Star Wars is a bold choice, and it forces these characters to make interesting decisions about how to move forward in a galaxy where everyone is out to get them \u2014 although what they do, and how they do it, is out of my control completely. Jedi: Fallen Order isn\u2019t a game with decisions; it\u2019s a linear narrative with enough juice to keep my interest until the credits. There\u2019s nothing better for melodrama than to put your characters in the most desperate situation of their lives, and Order 66 certainly does that for the Jedi. What would you do if you were being hunted by the government after years of service? What would you give up, or what power would you reach for? Who would you betray? This all happens in a game with so much sliding on mud and ice, and with puzzles that feel taken from adventure games in the PlayStation 2 era. It takes me a few hours to get into the swing of what Jedi: Fallen Order is trying to do, and there are a few weird odds and ends that seem strangely underbaked, but that\u2019s almost to be expected in a game that takes such a recognizable universe and does something this unexpected with it. This is one of the most exciting things about Jedi: Fallen Order. We\u2019ve had so many Star Wars experiences that were first-person shooters, or action games, or role-playing games, and of course all those mobile games. But this is a new idea for how Star Wars games can be structured, and shows how much room there is in this universe to experiment with new ideas of what we want to do in the land of the Jedi and the Empire. Yes, there\u2019s a lot about this game that\u2019s awkward. But to do something different, you have to do something different, and that means it may take some time for a game to find its footing. Jedi: Fallen Order is enjoyable, with caveats about its performance and some aspects of its design attached, but it goes places I didn\u2019t expect, and it gets there by a route I would never have considered. That\u2019s a bold choice for a game this inherently commercial. Jedi: Fallen Order is a flawed, sometimes messy game, but it\u2019s a Star Wars experience I didn\u2019t know I wanted. And after finishing it, I definitely want more. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is now available on PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.

In the world of publishing, a steady stream of Star Wars books and comics hit shelves on a weekly basis.From another perspective: It\u2019s incredibly hard to not be a Star Wars fan in 2019. The franchise is almost suffocating in its conquest of mainstream popular culture. Just look at all that stuff! There\u2019s a well-liked Star War for just about everyone. It\u2019s a feat of dominance that barely needs to be performed by Disney, the corporate monolith that now owns Star Wars (and just about everything else).It\u2019s very strange, then, that the Disney era of Star Wars has largely been a failure in the world of video games. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, the new single-player game from Respawn Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, is here to right that ship. Fallen Order is the good Star Wars game that has emerged after a string of high-profile failures and aborted plans since publisher Electronic Arts acquired the license to make Star Wars games in 2013.That Fallen Order is a very straightforward and unremarkable, albeit pleasing, sci-fi adventure makes it feel slight after years of disappointing Battlefront revivals and tantalizing canceled projects. But the fact that it adopts, and mainstreams, one of the most idiosyncratic and influential schools of game design of the decade\u2060\u2014the third-person, exploration-based action of games like Dark Souls\u2014 feels radical. Taken as a whole, Jedi: Fallen Order brings a very familiar concept to the world of Star Wars video games: balance. In Jedi: Fallen Order, you play as Cal Kestis, a Jedi Padawan in the era immediately following the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Sheev Palpatine has staged his coup of the Republic and become Emperor, and the Jedi are outlawed and hunted to the brink of extinction. Cal has somehow survived, and the game begins with him in the life in hiding he\u2019s settled into for sometime: working as a scrapper in a shipbreaking yard, tearing down grounded spaceships for parts. As a scrapper, Cal climbs walls and swings on ropes and leaps onto precarious ledges like a video game character would. But Cal can\u2019t stay in hiding for long. Eventually, his Jedi secret gets out, and he goes on the run from Imperial forces sweeping the galaxy for the last remaining Jedi. As Cal explores the universe and battles his way past various baddies, he also picks up a group of misfit friends and a macguffin that might be the secret to restoring the shattered Jedi Order. Fallen Order also has a heavy focus on exploration. You\u2019ll travel from planet to planet and back again over the course of Cal\u2019s journey, gaining new powers and abilities that open up new avenues for combat and traversal. Like Metroid and the games that it inspired, you\u2019ll regularly come across areas that are unreachable, locked off until you acquire the power that effectively functions as a key. You\u2019ll find shortcuts and secrets as you travel through labyrinthine planets, then backtrack through them again with your new powers, more swiftly than before. It\u2019s satisfying.It\u2019s also an experience that\u2019s full of things that want to kick your ass. There are giant alien bugs, asshole alien rams, and alien feral hogs, all put on these force-forsaken planets purely to piss you off. There are also a wide variety of Imperial Stormtroopers, droids, and highly-trained Inquisitors around to test your mettle. It\u2019s here, in combat, where Fallen Order\u2019s biggest surprise lies: The game is modeled after FromSoftware action role-playing games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne. I had heard this going into Fallen Order, but I didn\u2019t quite believe it until I played the game. If you\u2019ve played a FromSoft game, you\u2019ll recognize that influence on Fallen Order\u2014the way save points are places where you can meditate and choose to regain your health and replenish your stock of health recovery stims at the expense of respawning all defeated enemies.

Something about the game\u2019s combat, however, feels just a little off, like you\u2019re using a socket wrench that\u2019s a hair too big for the bolt you want to remove.

Respawn EntertainmentPC, PlayStation 4, Xbox OneNovember 15, 2019Finished the story in about 20 hours with some exploration on the side. These sudden difficulty spikes would be less troublesome if the game didn\u2019t feel so rough around the edges in other ways. I\u2019m not someone who\u2019s particularly hard on how a game looks and performs\u2014if I can do what the game wants me to do and it doesn\u2019t actively hurt my eyes to look at, I\u2019m fine. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but notice Fallen Order\u2019s visual hiccups on consoles. Playing on a PlayStation 4 Pro, textures would pop in and disappear regularly, and at times enemies would appear out of nowhere, or take a moment before they assumed their scripted animations. The camera is occasionally ill-suited to the task of keeping up with the game\u2019s intense combat. Every once in a while, the game will straight-up stop while you load into a new area, locking up for three seconds while everything loads.Barring the occasional enemy goof, none of this really impedes the gameplay. Once you\u2019re loaded into an area, you can run and jump and fight with few problems. The frame rate is generally stable and exploring the game is a pleasure. When all the textures load in properly, the worlds of Fallen Order look gorgeous. Some players might be disappointed that exploring doesn\u2019t yield anything more than cosmetic rewards or cursory \u201clore\u201d that really doesn\u2019t tell you much you don\u2019t already hear from other characters in-game. (Only two items you find in the world affect gameplay, extending your max health and Force.) I didn\u2019t mind, though, and I found myself getting extremely invested in customizing my lightsaber each time I found a new part.It\u2019s tempting to talk more about the Dark Souls influence on Fallen Order because it\u2019s more novel than the other points of comparison, like Uncharted and Metroid, which have been frequent design touchpoints in the world of big-budget video games. But the actual experience of playing Fallen Order reveals that the Dark Souls influence is the one you can buy into as much or as little as you want. The game\u2019s multiple difficulty modes give you the option to check out of combat almost completely, wielding your Jedi powers indiscriminately as an unstoppable space wizard. This is a perfectly viable way to play the game, not to mention a fun as hell one. After a decade of the Souls influence bleeding its way through video games, from indies like Hollow Knight to big-budget clones like Nioh or The Surge, Fallen Order presents an argument for a mainstream middle ground between the uncompromised vision of a game like Sekiro and the accessible challenge of God of War.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order resonates on the same primal level that the very first Star Wars movie did, and in the best possible world, it may well encourage the people who play it to reach outward\u2014to Metroid, to Sekiro or Bloodborne, to Hollow Knight or Hyper Light Drifter. Star Wars succeeded as a film because of the lessons it learned from movies that came before it. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that this Star Wars game has attempted to do the video game equivalent. That\u2019s an optimistic reading, one that has faith in video games\u2019 penchant for iteration and refinement, taking radical ideas and whittling them down to something that improves the experience of playing games for everyone.There\u2019s another way to look at this, just like there\u2019s another way to look at Star Wars fandom. It\u2019s where the risk-averse nature of big-budget game development wins out, where the FromSoftware action game just becomes the next Metroid, another increasingly shopworn collection of video game ideas used over and over from franchise to franchise, a brilliant spark dulled to an ember by conservative publishers happy to let big-budget video games chase their own tail as long as they\u2019re profitable.That\u2019s the fear, now that Respawn has given us a good Star Wars game. That the way Star Wars finally cracks video games in the Disney era is the same way Disney cracked other Star Wars entertainment: Taking what was once rare and special, and giving it to us over and over again until it\u2019s mundane.\nGiant Bomb, Ghost Busters: Spirits Unleashed ECTO EditionUnprofessional FridaysGame Mess Mornings 10/27/23GrubbSnaxMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Spoilercast with Bryan IntiharGameSpot After DarkDiscord Town Hall 10/27/23Giant Bomb PresentsThe Community Spotlight 2023.10.28The Community Spotlight 2023.10.21The Community Spotlight 2023.10.14The Community Spotlight 2023.10.28The Community Spotlight 2023.10.21The Community Spotlight 2023.10.14Jedi: Fallen Order is both one of the best Star Wars games to date and distressingly unrefined.Respawn's named-by-marketing Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a game that impresses and frustrates in almost equal measure. Here's an ambitious third-person action game that tells an engaging and at times moving story set five years after the events of Revenge of the Sith, when the Jedi Order was purged and the Republic gave way to the Empire. Rather than merely emulating the linear cinematic action of an Uncharted but with droids and lightsabers, Fallen Order makes an earnest effort to blend the usual ledge-climbing and flashy set pieces with simplified versions of the combat and progression from Dark Souls and the ability-based exploration of a Metroid. On paper, these elements add up to one of the most elaborate and original Star Wars games in a very long time, but poor performance, a multitude of minor bugs, and a pervasive sense that swaths of the game are just lacking in refinement all undermine what would otherwise be an easy game to recommend.Unsurprisingly, Fallen Order assumes a familiarity with all six of the original Star Wars films and situates itself squarely between the two trilogies, drawing far more influence from the prequels than any of the movies produced under Disney's imprimatur so far. Cal Kestis was but a wee padawan when Order 66 directed the Republic's clone troopers to slaughter their Jedi commanders, and since that time he's grown into a young man while working as a lowly scrapper on a junk planet and doing his best to evade the Empire's attention. When a life-or-death accident forces him to use his latent Jedi powers, Cal invites the wrath of the Imperial inquisitors tasked with hunting down the remaining Jedi \"traitors,\" and before long he finds himself on the run with Cere, a lapsed Jedi herself with a vague past and a burning desire to restore the vanquished order, and her pilot Greez, a gruff four-armed alien that comes off sort of like a neurotic New York cabbie.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b5f9506-8baf-42ae-811a-f6aa2f6e9f3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b5f9506-8baf-42ae-811a-f6aa2f6e9f3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "281559ba-9238-4e8c-b34a-4a14f631c440", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a018fc7d16254d0c9852679d8eaedd4354ca58879adf9c8dcf996494aff03ac4"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe83dc1d-8b72-4ae9-8734-47d8aee4e230", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ad65d602da84c7e5dc34661243e5b3fe762ba509f7e5c59ae1cbf6fedad93fd"}}, "hash": "5688bf485fd0682037da68af5b950e5a246490196e62d01ebfef1c9e879271df", "text": "The spry little droid BD-1, who hitches a ride on Cal's shoulder and acts like a skeleton key for any technical obstacles you run into, also becomes a pretty endearing character in its own right.The ensuing quest sends you in pursuit of a MacGuffin-ish object and involves stock video game tropes like a trio of ancient tombs and the lost knowledge of a vanished civilization, but that generic setup is merely a backdrop to the real story, which is largely about revealing and attempting to heal the lingering wounds inflicted on the game's characters by the devastation of the Clone Wars and the Republic's collapse. Cal and Cere get the bulk of the screentime here, but there's depth to nearly all the supporting characters, even the primary antagonist; the oppressive reign of the Empire has been cruel to all of them, and each is desperately searching for purpose, redemption, vengeance or power in a harsh and chaotic galaxy. The game has a good grasp of the larger-than-life, mythical themes that underpin Star Wars, and for my money touches on a couple of The Last Jedi's ideas in particular with more coherence and subtlety than that movie did. In particular, Fallen Order specializes in flashbacks and dream sequences, so often the tedious bane of good video game storytelling. Here, Respawn uses the game's technology to play around with shifting environments and a blend of past, present, and future in clever and evocative ways that feel unique and help sell the story's themes and personal drama. It's refreshing just to get a glimpse of this little-seen era of Star Wars in the first place, let alone with such great writing, acting, and narrative technique.Fallen Order gives you command of Greez's humble ship the Mantis, which you use to navigate at will between roughly half a dozen planets as the story introduces them. While Cal's friends repeatedly signal in a slightly rote fashion that you're free to go wherever, whenever, there's really only ever one plot-relevant destination at a time, so you're better off simply following the objective indicator for the first few hours. The game's non-linear element comes into play once you start earning the standard Force powers like push and pull, which in addition to helping in combat will also give you access to new territory on the planets you've already visited. This is where the Metroid influence comes in, though it's as if Metroid slapped a big flashing neon sign on all of its hidden secrets. The game's elaborate 3D maps plaster glowing colored signposts on every point in the environment where exploration is or will become possible; if you see red, it means \"Hey, you can't access this yet. Come back when it turns green.\" Even unexplored routes without any ability gating are marked with big flashing yellow indicators, so there's rarely any mystery about where you have or haven't been, although the larger multi-level maps are a little too busy to be easily parsed, and getting around the bigger locations before you've unlocked all the traversal abilities and with no fast travel can occasionally feel like a cumbersome chore.In a game where I just wanted to move the story along and see what there is to see, I actually appreciated how blatant the map makes progression for the most part, though the value of the side content you're going back to find will largely be subjective, since the bulk of it consists of small areas containing minor collectibles like costume variations and snippets of lore. The game did make use of backtracking in a couple of more interesting ways that I encountered, though. In one case, I went back to explore an early planet on a lark and stumbled onto an extremely valuable combat upgrade-slash-piece of fan service with no real fanfare. Information from Respawn suggests all players will get that upgrade later on in the story in a different location, but finding it early and on my own initiative was frankly one of the more delightful moments I had playing the game. In another case, one seemingly minor pathway led to an entire crashed Star Destroyer that I spent an hour poking around in, solving puzzles and picking up little bits of contextual story and a couple of upgrades. The game tends to hide healing upgrades and Force and health meter extensions in these larger side areas, so there's at least some mechanical incentive to go back and look around. Fallen Order isn't a short game even if you blaze through the critical path, but poking around all these side areas was a big part of the appeal for me and led me to spend what felt like at least 30 hours with the game. All games should really start including hour counters though.Some fuss has been made prior to release about Fallen Order's resemblance to Dark Souls, though the comparison turns out to be somewhat superficial.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe83dc1d-8b72-4ae9-8734-47d8aee4e230": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe83dc1d-8b72-4ae9-8734-47d8aee4e230", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b5f9506-8baf-42ae-811a-f6aa2f6e9f3b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5688bf485fd0682037da68af5b950e5a246490196e62d01ebfef1c9e879271df"}, "3": {"node_id": "540e5b48-2354-4730-becc-2d59dc2f98eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4430c348288c344cb9fca2420f7be0083966b1c441e8f46ae033575fab063d08"}}, "hash": "8ad65d602da84c7e5dc34661243e5b3fe762ba509f7e5c59ae1cbf6fedad93fd", "text": "The loop upon arriving on a new planet is straightforward: explore the ancient tombs or jungle or Imperial dig site along a mostly linear path, unlock a few shortcuts that will let you skip a lot of that traversal the second time around, and press on to the next story beat. The game's bonfire stand-in is the meditation point, where you rest to cash in experience points on lightsaber moves, Force powers, and survivability, and also have the option of restoring your health and stim packs (the Estus flask equivalent) while respawning all the enemies you've killed. Reappearing enemies make contextual sense in Dark Souls and Bloodborne, which take place in lonely, dead worlds that exist somewhat out of time, where fighting the same fights over and over lends itself to the purgatorial feeling those games try to evoke. I found it a little odd to run into the same combat encounters over and over in a more traditional linear, narrative-driven game like Fallen Order, and the game itself seems to agree to an extent, since it plays fast and loose with which enemies do respawn and which ones don't as dictated by the events of the story. Still, Respawn deserves credit for drawing on multiple influences in this game and coming up with a welcome change of pace from the typical by-the-numbers licensed action game.Fallen Order's combat is also a sort of Dark Souls-lite thing where you can lock onto enemies by clicking the right stick, and you and most melee enemies each have a block meter that needs to be whittled down with repeated strikes or well timed counters before you can get in and do some actual damage. Then the block meter refills on the stronger enemies and you do the whole thing once or twice more. (Any attempt at making your lightsaber as instantly deadly as it appears in the films goes right out the window in an attempt to provide the player an actual challenge.) There are plenty of Stormtroopers shooting straight up guns at you as well, though they're much more easily dealt with since the game is generous about letting you reflect projectiles right back at whoever shot them. Fallen Order certainly doesn't rise to a FromSoftware-like level of challenge, but it's tough enough that you'll need to get at least a basic grasp on dodging, parrying, and using Force powers to control groups of enemies, many of whom are protected by block meters and also have unblockable attacks themselves (which are thankfully signaled well in advance). The combat is usually at least serviceable and often even satisfying, though it doesn't have quite the elegant feel of a Souls game, where controls and character animations and visual feedback all harmonize to give you a sublime, instinctual connection to the challenge you're facing. The combat here also tends to collapse under its own weight and become a little annoying to manage when it throws you into encounters of six or eight enemies up close with even more shooting at you from off to the side.There are of course climbing sequences and sliding sequences and scripted boss fights and the other sort of fluff you expect in a game with cinematic inspirations, and Fallen Order also provides the occasional reasonably clever puzzle-solving in some of the more dungeon spelunking-style areas. While none of these component parts quite rise to the level of the more focused games that inspire them, they mix well enough to be fun and engaging for the entirety of the lengthy run time, especially while propelled by the impressive quality of the storytelling. Where Fallen Order tragically falters is in that classically nebulous category, polish. Perhaps most glaringly, all versions of the game have a form of fairly severe stuttering that seems to happen when you move from area to area--presumably when the game is trying to load in new level assets--that causes the performance to slow to a crawl for a few seconds every time you run more than a couple of minutes in any direction. In a few places it also suffers badly, worse than I've seen in a while, from the Unreal Engine tendency to load in scenery and textures too slowly to keep up with the camera, and I actually saw textures unload and then load back in briefly in one scene.Moreover, I ran into a multitude of minor bugs and unrefined elements too numerous to list here, but among them were a particular enemy type that I repeatedly caught in what looked like the quadrupedal-alien version of a T-pose, enemies disengaging and running away from me in the middle of a fight or \"seeing\" me and activating through a closed door (including, in the latter case, the game's last boss), a few unreliable interactions between Cal and traversal elements like zip lines and balance beams, a glitchy camera angle on respawn in the middle of a hectic action sequence, a number of erratic animations and some missing environmental sound effects, and a glaring bug where I was unable to wall run on the very first wall in the wall running tutorial.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "540e5b48-2354-4730-becc-2d59dc2f98eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "540e5b48-2354-4730-becc-2d59dc2f98eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe83dc1d-8b72-4ae9-8734-47d8aee4e230", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8ad65d602da84c7e5dc34661243e5b3fe762ba509f7e5c59ae1cbf6fedad93fd"}, "3": {"node_id": "f294a673-304a-4bf7-a594-637d0b73eeb3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0fa795b98f52719b2709787628f3b371ac6ea7be155df6e0209d1f19625fb924"}}, "hash": "4430c348288c344cb9fca2420f7be0083966b1c441e8f46ae033575fab063d08", "text": "That last one happened on both PS4 and Xbox. To be clear, any one or two or even half a dozen of these quibbles wouldn't even be worth mentioning here, but they were pervasive enough to start chipping away at the experience I was having with what's otherwise a really enjoyable game, and they're particularly hard to ignore coming from companies as big as EA and Disney, and in a franchise as hallowed as Star Wars. As neither a game developer nor a member of Respawn I certainly can't pretend to know what led to the game shipping in this state, though the impending release of The Rise of Skywalker and the peak of the holiday shopping season are hard to ignore. My layman's impression is simply that the game would have benefited from a few more months in production. These problems can't be a surprise to anyone who made and tested this game, but of course time is what's required to actually fix them.That's what frustrates me about Jedi: Fallen Order: It's good enough that its host of technical problems feels like an affront to what the game could have been, and to the hard work and talent--and there's a considerable amount of talent here--of the people who made it. Actually, looking back at the long history of Star Wars video games, the last time someone attempted a character-driven game in this franchise was The Force Unleashed II, and that was almost a decade ago. And I can't find another Star Wars game in the decades before that which brings together so many different elements and tells a unique story with as much gravity as this one. Now it's up to EA to give Respawn the chance to hammer out as many of these annoying imperfections as it can via post-release updates, and allow Jedi: Fallen Order to take its rightful place in the pantheon of all-time great Star Wars games.\u00a9 2023 FANDOM, INC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\nUse your keyboard!Log in to comment\nUSgamer, Even if its core components are owed to other games, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order finds a reason for their inclusion and stops just short of greatness.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is game that is many things to different people. You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.It\u2019s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it\u2019s even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.Where it\u2019s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.Fallen Order\u2019s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game\u2019s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era\u2019s biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.One of the narrative\u2019s strongest elements is that it doesn\u2019t rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There\u2019s one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn't matter to the general story.After hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez's ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year\u2019s best new character. I have to give special attention to his voice direction - and my god, every little animation he plays \u2013 both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot.

I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2\u2019s BT-7274.The general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn't so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.This means you\u2019ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn\u2019t shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don\u2019t always need to follow the quest marker if you don\u2019t want to.I visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it\u2019s great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.As more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures. It\u2019s not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware\u2019s work, which is what makes the map \u2013 available to you at any point \u2013 such a lifesaver.The map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren\u2019t. They\u2019re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It\u2019s a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake\u2019s map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn\u2019t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.In your adventures, you\u2019ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they\u2019re often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however - units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.Those not only offer the biggest challenge, they\u2019re mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.Fallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.You\u2019re going to parry the basic trooper\u2019s bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You\u2019ll watch for the melee trooper\u2019s very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you\u2019ll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you\u2019ll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious. I understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you\u2019re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.A better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.Fallen Order\u2019s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "703758c2-5881-4452-8b8f-51132470a7f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "703758c2-5881-4452-8b8f-51132470a7f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "f294a673-304a-4bf7-a594-637d0b73eeb3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0fa795b98f52719b2709787628f3b371ac6ea7be155df6e0209d1f19625fb924"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0304420-8c05-46e4-88dc-7fcb8c0223b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f81296d8793994a00f3e99688369518d8e1f43ba1a608d0bd649581da274ce1a"}}, "hash": "8d3859ea84fdbe91b4261fd5966e473592d1c02ff351cfc0f3d99fced9bf4f96", "text": "You don\u2019t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.You and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you'll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It\u2019s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution. Enemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you\u2019ll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it\u2019s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.Another problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There\u2019s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents\u2019 guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry. Fallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can\u2019t cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don\u2019t really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers. They\u2019ll often continue their combo unabated and you\u2019ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren\u2019t working.Over time, I realised that the animation simply isn\u2019t fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack. These little inconsistencies add up, and could\u2019ve soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn\u2019t hook me. \n\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all \u2013 at the game\u2019s worst moments \u2013 lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually - but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren\u2019t enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I\u2019ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don\u2019t always win. The action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting \u2013 but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.And yes, it doesn't always get there in this one, but damn If I can\u2019t help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It\u2019s worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn\u2019t settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent - albeit flawed \u2013 combat.Version tested: PC.\n        Sign in and unlock a world of features\n      \n        Get access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0304420-8c05-46e4-88dc-7fcb8c0223b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0304420-8c05-46e4-88dc-7fcb8c0223b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "703758c2-5881-4452-8b8f-51132470a7f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d3859ea84fdbe91b4261fd5966e473592d1c02ff351cfc0f3d99fced9bf4f96"}, "3": {"node_id": "482d6f59-6e25-4e69-9337-d9d8584d9e37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c668b26147cead84509fc2b210c21b3021464f5bb7ad17e840eb211fdd427ada"}}, "hash": "f81296d8793994a00f3e99688369518d8e1f43ba1a608d0bd649581da274ce1a", "text": "Close    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nSherif Saed\n\n          Contributor\n        Sherif is VG247\u2019s go-to shooter and Souls-likes person.

Not because it\u2019s a great game, it inhabits a niche that we haven\u2019t seen much of this generation. It\u2019s merely a good game. I ran into a ton of glitches and collision issues. Still, the overall package was entertaining enough to ignore them for the most part. It\u2019s odd because I\u2019m so used to games either being masterpieces or complete disasters that it took me a while to sort out my feelings on Jedi Fallen Order.Of course, if you\u2019re a Star Wars fan, there\u2019s no real room to sort out your feelings. For all its flaws, Jedi Fallen Order is the only gig in town when it comes to Star Wars gaming this year. However, it is a step in the right direction. It is a far cry from the microtransaction-laden disaster that was the launch of Battlefront 2.The Star Wars saga has been all over the timeline since Disney took the reins, and Jedi Fallen Order is no different. This time, we\u2019re delving into the galaxy five years after the execution of Order 66 and the Declaration of a New Order that established the Galactic Empire. The Republic is still freshly dead, and the Rebel Alliance is just a sparkle in the eyes of those who would oppose Palpatine. Amid a galaxy in turmoil, you take control of Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis.Kestis works as a scrapper on the planet Brakka and keeps his Jedi past hidden. There he and his comrades tear apart the massive capital ships of the Clone Wars so that their materials can be reclaimed to produce new Imperial warships. One thing leads to another, and the Imperial Inquisitorius learns of Cal\u2019s existence.Fleeing the Second Sister of the Inquisitorius, Cal is eventually saved by The Mantis, crewed by Jedi master Cere Junda and pilot Greez Dritus. Cere has lost contact with the Force and asks Cal to help open a Jedi vault on the planet Bogano. Here, he meets the droid BD-1 and learns of Jedi master Eno Cordova and his research on the planet and the vault.The game has you solving the mystery of the vault on Bogano, and coming to terms with Cal\u2019s past. It\u2019s a quest that spans multiple worlds and brings you into contact with many familiar locations, characters, and concepts from Star Wars lore.The story itself is pretty typical Star Wars fare. Cal is likable enough, and everyone has the patented tragic backstory that gives them just enough definition of character to be motivated. However, being set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope takes away some of the oomph Jedi Fallen Order could have. After all, you already know what\u2019s happened before the game and what will happen afterward. You know that whatever happens in the game won\u2019t have much of an impact on the galaxy; otherwise, Rogue One and A New Hope couldn\u2019t take place. With how hard Disney is sticking to its new canon, Cal and company just don\u2019t have any space to grow, and nothing that big can occur.In Jedi Fallen Order, you\u2019re searching the backwaters of the universe, so don\u2019t expect any Coruscant or Corellia here. You\u2019ll be visiting planets like Kashyyyk and Dathomir in search of clues needed to unlock the vault on Bogano. As such, the gameplay is a lot like that found in the Uncharted series. There\u2019s a lot of exploring wildlands and ancient temples, and there\u2019s an Indiana Jones feel to the whole thing.I\u2019m of two minds when it comes to Jedi Fallen Order\u2018s direction. On the one hand, I feel like Star Wars has had enough jungles, forests, and ancient ruins to last the franchise a lifetime. It seems like almost every movie, game, comic, and novel has the protagonist running around some overgrown or completely barren planet looking for ancient wisdom. On the other, the sense of loneliness and danger that permeates your adventures in Jedi Fallen Order does fit the theme of the game well, and each planet has enough unique characteristics to keep things interesting.However, Jedi Fallen Order could have been more interesting had Respawn been a bit more inventive with the scenery. After a while, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in abandoned temples on Zeffo or Dathomir, it all sort of blends together.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b12ee35a-32d5-4f3e-8645-4cd85d42ff17": {"__data__": {"id_": "b12ee35a-32d5-4f3e-8645-4cd85d42ff17", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "482d6f59-6e25-4e69-9337-d9d8584d9e37", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c668b26147cead84509fc2b210c21b3021464f5bb7ad17e840eb211fdd427ada"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca5baaee-413d-47dd-bebe-6ae78ea0ecf6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1ab616d85a933c925f4591f4379b70b20cd88a2b696f39131b316a9e2a3ee7d"}}, "hash": "234bd42ede3a5e11830fc049129fe7dc2c1f41d80825b4fd174cc16d603259ea", "text": "I wish we\u2019d have spent more time amongst the derelict, grounded ships on Brakka, or the rusty, gangster-filled space station of Ordo Eris.Most of Jedi Fallen Order\u2018s planets are semi-open-world affairs. You\u2019re usually plopped down by the Mantis and given an objective on the excellent 3D map interface. After that, it\u2019s up to you to find the correct route to your goal.It\u2019s easy to liken the progression in the game to a Metroid game. While exploring a planet, you\u2019ll run into areas you can\u2019t currently access, which will be marked red on your holomap. This means that your initial run through a location will be mostly linear, funneling you into an endpoint that will either open up another planet or provide you with a new ability that will expand your range of possible actions.The layout of each planet is masterful, and I really loved how natural progression felt. Getting a new ability is always cause for celebration as you remember paths that were closed to you that are now open for exploration. The Metroid formula has been used time and again in many games. However, Jedi Fallen Order is proof that it\u2019s still a great way to gate progression in a way that doesn\u2019t feel like you keep hitting arbitrary roadblocks.The gaining of abilities that aid in progression also does a lot to make you feel more like a Jedi. Skills like Force Push and Pull can be used for attack in addition to overcoming obstacles. So, it ends up that the more places you can go, the more powerful you are, and the more challenge the game can throw at you.The save system in Jedi Fallen Order works much the same as it does in Dark Souls. Throughout each world, there are Meditation Circles scattered here and there. Meditating at a circle saves the game, and you then get the choice to learn new skills that enhance your equipment and abilities or rest to heal and regain stims.The only way you have to heal in Jedi Fallen Order is by resting at a Meditation Circle or by using one of your limited (but upgradable) number of stims. However, if you do choose to rest, all the enemies in the game will respawn. This makes each visit to a circle a tactical decision. Do you have enough stims and current health left to avoid respawning your foes, or are you too close to death to risk moving forward?The combat, too, is like Dark Souls-lite. Fighting in Jedi Fallen Order isn\u2019t quite as methodical as in the Souls series, but it is similar. Especially at high difficulty levels, blocking, parries, and timely utilization of Force powers are required to make it through alive. Each enemy you meet is a threat until you learn their routines, and even late game, you\u2019ll run into regular grunts that can make mincemeat of you.The challenge makes combat incredibly satisfying, and once you master it, you\u2019ll genuinely start feeling like a Jedi. Deflecting blaster bolts, chopping giant rats in half, and downing AT-STs all feels natural, which makes one omission from the game incredibly strange. There is no dismemberment of human enemies or even blood. Not every game has to contain fountains of gore, but when I can bisect a rat, or cut a lizard-frog\u2019s tongue off, it\u2019s strange fighting Stormtroopers and leaving not a mark on them.Given that within the first hour of A New Hope someone lost an arm to a lightsaber, you wouldn\u2019t think there\u2019d be an issue here. The odd thing is that many of the finishing move animations you can trigger on human enemies seem to be geared around dismemberment. You\u2019ll see Cal cleave a Stormtrooper in half with no apparent consequences. It makes the lightsaber feel more like a glowing baseball bat instead of the incredibly dangerous weapon it is, and it\u2019s evident that the move was made to get a T rating instead of M.Jedi Fallen Order\u2018s most significant issue is how buggy it is. The collision detection in this game is horrible. I\u2019ve had Cal fall straight out of the bottom of the Mantis as it leaves a planet. I\u2019ve fallen down into death pits and respawned just far enough from a ledge to just continue falling down the hole over and over until I had to reload.The problem, as I see it, is that most of the level\u2019s collision geometry is made of boxes. So, you\u2019ll often fall through what looks like solid ground because it\u2019s jutting out a little farther than the collision box.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca5baaee-413d-47dd-bebe-6ae78ea0ecf6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca5baaee-413d-47dd-bebe-6ae78ea0ecf6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "b12ee35a-32d5-4f3e-8645-4cd85d42ff17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "234bd42ede3a5e11830fc049129fe7dc2c1f41d80825b4fd174cc16d603259ea"}, "3": {"node_id": "eb2cb6d8-8543-424a-be82-407857a3e965", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f97966d6d76ec293836ffe42c1d1f8a43e3b37604c49db4f6233986c510e22b"}}, "hash": "a1ab616d85a933c925f4591f4379b70b20cd88a2b696f39131b316a9e2a3ee7d", "text": "This issue is compounded by the fact that the game doesn\u2019t calculate Cal dying from distance fell. Instead, certain parts of the level just have a \u201ckill zone\u201d that you pass through that results in automatic death.The results are that sometimes it looks like you can jump from a higher ledge to a lower one, and you\u2019ll pass through the kill zone and die. Oddly, there\u2019s no fall damage that I have ever run into. This results in situations where you can jump down 50 feet or more and land without a scrape, and others where a 5-foot drop will instantly kill you.Fortunately, the above also applies to your enemies. In fact, one of the most effective ways to take out swathes of enemies is to Force Push them over ledges. This makes an intimidating battle against multiple Stormtroopers and Purge Troopers trivial. No enemies other than bosses have any resistance to the Force, so any time you find foes anywhere near a drop, your best bet is to just cheesily spam push them into the hole.Jedi Fallen Order suffers from a general lack of polish. It\u2019s a shame because this is the best Star Wars game we\u2019ve gotten in years. However, instead of rigidly holding themselves to a November release date, Respawn should have taken another few months to do another quality assurance pass.Despite polish issues, Jedi Fallen Order is a ton of fun. It\u2019s raw Star Wars just like we used to get with the Dark Forces series. I haven\u2019t been very hopeful for the gaming future of Star Wars since EA took over the license, but that changed with Jedi Fallen Order. For all its flaws, it\u2019s a game that taps into my nostalgia in a big way, and I very much hope that this is the first in a new line of games that aren\u2019t just rabid, designed by committee money grabs.Jedi Fallen Order isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. The critical factor with this game is that it taps into that sense of adventure that Star Wars instills in fans. The story isn\u2019t breathtaking, the gameplay can be buggy and repetitive at times, but for the most part, it\u2019s a blast. There are lightsabers and Stormtroopers, and sometimes that\u2019s all it takes.8Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

It\u2019s one of the most unforgiving licenses known to man, especially after LucasArts gave us hit after hit to tee up later generations.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u00a0feels like one of those hits for the first time in a long time.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u00a0(PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One) Developer: Respawn Entertainment Publisher: Electronic Arts Released: November 15, 2019 MSRP: $59.99Hit as it may be, it\u2019s prone to flaws, but Respawn has given us a hell of a reason to be excited for its action-future.\u00a0As I noted in my initial assessment, Jedi: Fallen Order\u2018s\u00a0story is secondary at first and slowly creeps up, offloading a ton of exposition and character growth near the end. The rest is basically on autopilot in favor of getting you to new maps to explore, then it abruptly ends in a clear bid for a potential sequel. There\u2019s very little I can talk about without venturing into spoiler territory, just know that this is not an expansive universe-building trek: it mostly just takes existing bits of themes and lore. That philosophy permeates through Fallen Order\u2018s entire being, which yields Uncharted and Tomb Raider\u00a0platforming, with Arkham\u00a0and From Software design thrown in.What we get in the end is a good amalgam of all of those ideas, and one of the best-looking games to date that\u2019s a wonderful encapsulation of the joy of the Star Wars\u00a0galaxy. The Jedi fantasy is alive and well, through an almost puzzle-like combat system that rewards fast and frenetic reaction times. Frequently as our Jedi hero Cal, I would be assessing multiple threats in my head, wondering what to do with each individual enemy type.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb2cb6d8-8543-424a-be82-407857a3e965": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb2cb6d8-8543-424a-be82-407857a3e965", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca5baaee-413d-47dd-bebe-6ae78ea0ecf6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1ab616d85a933c925f4591f4379b70b20cd88a2b696f39131b316a9e2a3ee7d"}, "3": {"node_id": "ecff6d02-e66a-4a02-b7da-2d8b2a3d5d11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f85396ad8d2760b0a18eba87cca0e0f9f5982b8aea64aa7b9c5c780f2ec417ab"}}, "hash": "3f97966d6d76ec293836ffe42c1d1f8a43e3b37604c49db4f6233986c510e22b", "text": "Quickly force pushing a threat away is a resplendent strategy, but knowing how each unit is weighted (some are just flicked, some are thrown) is important or you\u2019ve just wasted precious force energy (mana).Deciding whether or not to deflect incoming fire back at Stormtroopers or run up and take them out first is yet another decision, which is often tough if another big melee unit is guarding them. AI can sometimes fight other AI (true to form for the often hostile planets of the Star Wars\u00a0canon), and they\u2019ll actually damage or kill one another. There\u2019s also plenty of lovely moments of chaos like throwing a Stormtrooper\u2019s own grenades into a group; happy accidents, if you will. Once you really get the parry system down (for precise melee and bullet deflections) it all clicks.\u00a0Bosses are similarly puzzled out, though I wish there were more down and dirty lightsaber battles.Jedi: Fallen Order\u00a0also takes a good approach to difficulty that should please everyone. The lowest setting is easier for sure, but still offers a formidable set of enemies that actually do things. Action vets will want to jack it up (to hard or very hard, both of which are offered at the start without unlocks, bless), which provides razor-thin parry timing and even more aggressive AI. Normal feels just that: occasional tough moments without being too oppressive.While much of Jedi: Fallen Order\u00a0is a known entity, its\u00a0unpredictability is born out of the exploration aspect (that takes up much of the 20- to 30-hour runtime), which provides you with several locales to haunt, Metroid\u00a0style. You can just walk into an optional mini boss and get wrecked, or unlock shortcuts with a congratulatory message on-screen. It\u2019s gamey in that way, and a few portions even feel like clear riffs on Zelda\u00a0or Darksiders puzzle dungeons. When Jedi: Fallen Order\u00a0is at its best, you\u2019re fighting what feels like a small army on-screen, venturing into the unknown and finding new beasts or hazards. When it\u2019s at its worst, it plops you onto\u00a0Mario 64-like\u00a0slope sections (of which there are many) designed to funnel you into new areas or prevent return trips. One of those portions even feels straight out of Donkey Kong Country\u00a0in a goofy, tone-clashing way.The main draw for exploration is secret items (like force energy or life upgrade enhancements), though I wasn\u2019t really compelled to explore the more rote areas unless I specifically saw something in the distance. No fast travel? Some problem. Thankfully if you plummet to your death it instantly restarts you where you were (at the cost of some life), but if you fall and live you need to go back to where you were manually, which can be exhausting. Backtracking can also feel like work, in spite of that tantalizing \u201cpercent explored\u201d marker on the map. That said, it is extremely satisfying to go back to old areas with new skills and own them. Then there\u2019s the lightsaber customization collectibles (the bulk of them), which is a fanservice dream. The same goes for the subtle and not-so-subtle film and Clone Wars\u00a0references.It\u2019s all good-tempered fun, but not when the engine isn\u2019t cooperating. Despite the sheer beauty of the art and world itself, Fallen Order falls behind on a technical level on consoles, and if you\u2019re on anything less than an Xbox One X or PS4 Pro, buyer beware. Even on a PS4 Pro I encountered moments of stuttering and model pop-in on performance mode\u00a0\u2014 an extra option meant to favor framerate. The \u201copen\u201d sandboxes can also require multiple instances of loading within minutes of each other, especially for the larger planets like\u00a0Kashyyyk. In a sense it feels like a next-gen game on current-gen hardware.You\u2019re going to occasionally roll your eyes at a cheesy moment or groan at a technical issue, but Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\u00a0stands alone as an action game devoid of its Star Wars\u00a0influence. If you grin at the mere mention of the phrase \u201ckyber crystals,\u201d you\u2019ll get even more out of it.[This review is based on a retail copy of the game provided by the publisher.]GreatImpressive efforts with a few noticeable problems holding them back.

It's also one ... [+] of the best 'Souls-like' games out there.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a brilliant single-player game from Respawn Entertainment, the company behind the Titanfall games and Apex Legends. You can feel the influence of those games in Fallen Order, but unlike Respawn\u2019s earlier work, this is a third-person action game deeply reminiscent of FromSoftware\u2019s SoulsBorne games, and perhaps even more akin to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. There are also elements of Uncharted, Tomb Raider and even The Legend Of Zelda here. Respawn dips its creative brush into many different palettes, and the result is spectacular.The game takes place just after the fall of the Old Republic, some time after the end of The Revenge Of The Sith and the fall of the Jedi Order, and long before Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi meet. What remaining Jedi exist in the universe live in hiding.The story follows Cal Kestis (Cameron Monaghan), a padawan who managed to escape the Jedi purge and has been living ever since in hiding, not revealing his powers and slowly forgetting many of them. As the game progresses, you\u2019ll recover these memories and with them, a host of new powerful abilities.Progression, Skills and AbilitiesStar Wars Jedi: Fallen OrderThe game\u2019s progression works in several different ways. There are the Jedi powers that you unlock vis-a-vis memories at various points throughout the game. These include things like double-jumping, Force pull and Force push and so forth.Then there are upgrades for BD-1, your adorable droid companion that you unlock at various upgrade stations you encounter throughout the game. These are often powers that help you navigate new areas of a map by unlocking previously impassable doors and so forth.You\u2019ll also find Stims hidden across the game\u2019s various planets. These are essentially the same as Estus Flasks from Dark Souls. BD-1 carries them and will toss them to you when you heal. The more you carry, the more times you can heal. When you meditate at meditation points, you\u2019ll replenish your Stims.You can also upgrade your lightsaber a couple of times, but I won\u2019t get into spoilery details about that. There are also a ton of customization options for the lightsaber, which is actually pretty cool even if you won\u2019t notice most of them in the heat of battle.Finally, there\u2019s a skill tree that you can spend skill points to unlock. The skill tree expands as you awaken various latent Force powers, so you won\u2019t have access to every skill from the get-go. It includes both passive and active abilities. For instance, you might spend skill points on increasing maximum health or Force, or improving the efficacy of BD-1\u2019s Stims. Or you could buy a skill that gives you a powerful Force attack or let\u2019s you throw your lightsaber at enemies.CombatStar Wars Jedi: Fallen OrderThis isn\u2019t a combo-based action game. The combat mechanics are very similar to Dark Souls, or perhaps more precisely to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c1a85be-7dc6-44e8-bf3b-a0ad0d183091": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c1a85be-7dc6-44e8-bf3b-a0ad0d183091", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "ecff6d02-e66a-4a02-b7da-2d8b2a3d5d11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f85396ad8d2760b0a18eba87cca0e0f9f5982b8aea64aa7b9c5c780f2ec417ab"}, "3": {"node_id": "66d0a329-934d-436e-8d5a-d61434b41633", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b05c298786e2ae66e776a52ef559bc4f692d758210577e7bb47b6bd9ec97b8e5"}}, "hash": "d2c9157a1f3c489d69705f8889cad1c7d97d444f90e79a8a669440215ec1a3ba", "text": "You can lock onto enemies, dodge out of the way, hit with normal or heavy attacks\u2014the latter use Force\u2014and parry incoming attacks which allows you to respond with a special counter-attack. Parry time gets very tricky at higher difficulty levels, and I never quite felt I got the hang of it in the same way I did with Sekiro.Unlike FromSoftware\u2019s games, you can choose from four different difficulty levels. I chose the second-hardest for my playthrough\u2014Jedi Master. You can also play on Story mode, Jedi Knight (which is what my nine-year-old is playing on) or the most difficult, Jedi Grandmaster. I\u2019m saving that one for a second playthrough. I find Jedi Knight is much, much easier than Jedi Master, and I prefer more challenge to less.So how challenging is the game? It depends. Some parts\u2014some boss fights, in particular\u2014are very challenging on Jedi Master but on Jedi Knight can be a walk in the park. You can change difficulty at any time, though I still think it\u2019s best to keep at it until you overcome. It just feels better to win fair and square, and like Souls games, learning an enemy\u2019s move-set and how to counter, dodge and respond with your own suite of abilities is enough to overcome the odds.Combat is fun, and becomes increasingly more fun as you gain more and more powerful abilities. The ability to pull especially annoying enemies toward you from a distance and one-shot them is incredibly gratifying. Force pushing a group of mooks off a ledge is also. Force powers drain your Force meter, so you\u2019ll need to constantly switch between normal attacks and Force powers, since the only way to regain Force is by hitting enemies. In some boss fights this means you\u2019ll need to really pay attention to your Force meter.When you die, you\u2019ll need to reach the point you died or\u2014more commonly\u2014the enemy that killed you in order to restore your lost XP. You lose XP but not skill points, so if you have two skill points and a half full XP meter, you\u2019ll keep the skill points but lose the XP. Simply striking the enemy restores your XP, health and Force.Platforming, Exploration and Level DesignStar Wars Jedi: Fallen OrderCombat is a big part of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but it\u2019s not everything. Exploration is a huge aspect of Fallen Order\u2019s gameplay, and it often feels a bit like you\u2019re playing Uncharted or Tomb Raider. There\u2019s lots of wall-climbing, platforming, wall-running, vine-swinging and so one and so forth.This is all coupled with level design more reminiscent of Dark Souls. The game\u2019s planets are all quite different and some of the maps are much more elaborate and vast than others. But often the levels are very three-dimensional, replete with short-cuts and secret areas to find. In many ways, if you took the platforming and exploration of Tomb Raider and just had FromSoftware design the levels, this is what you\u2019d get.Respawn does other cool things with the maps. For instance, they\u2019re often very dynamic. You\u2019ll go through one section of the map and face certain enemies, but when you get back to the same point later, new enemies will have appeared. One time I fought through a bunch of Stormtroopers and when I came back to the same area the Stormtroopers were being attacked by various monsters.The map not only changes as you play through the story, you\u2019ll unlock or be able to reach new areas as you find new upgrades and awaken new powers. In this sense, it\u2019s very much in the Metroidvania tradition. You\u2019ll often spot an area you know is reachable, but you won\u2019t be able to reach it until many hours later after you\u2019ve found the proper ability. It\u2019s fun to go back to older areas and have new enemies, new secret paths and so forth.Each world is essentially a self-contained map. Some are more elaborate than others.

Kashyyyk\u2014the Wookie homeworld\u2014is lush and vast, overgrown with jungles and towered over by the massive Origin Tree. The final two planets you visit only briefly, but they have their own unique feel and design as well. I won\u2019t spoil every location.Unlike pretty much every EA game these days, Respawn used the Unreal Engine instead of EA\u2019s proprietary Frostbite engine to create Fallen Order. I\u2019m not sure what it would have looked like or played like had they gone with Frostbite, but I\u2019d wager it would look better but play worse. Frostbite games are gorgeous most of the time, but the engine isn\u2019t designed for every scenario, and Unreal gave Respawn more flexibility.The game is impressive at a distance and suffers from closer scrutiny, especially when it comes to faces, though there is nothing truly egregious here.When it comes to sound design and music, I was never particularly blown away but I have no complaints. The sound of lightsabers crackling in the air, or Stormtrooper blasters blasting, are all very Star Wars. The soundtrack rarely meanders into familiar film territory, but it holds its own as a perfectly fine, if somewhat forgettable, OST.I did encounter some bugs. I could walk through walls that you clearly weren\u2019t supposed to walk through. Once I was hit by a rocket from one of the red-shouldered Stormtroopers and it blasted me into the wall/floor of the ledge I was on and I had to jump and bounce around for five minutes until I could get out. But other than these kind of mild annoyances, the game ran just fine for me. Load times could be better, but I\u2019ve seen worse.VerdictStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order BD-1 droidStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is the \u201cJedi Souls\u201d I\u2019ve been asking for for years. I absolutely loved the game. It\u2019s one of, if not the, best \u201cSouls-like\u201d games I\u2019ve played, and partly that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t just stick with the Dark Souls formula, but tries lots of other things as well, from platforming to the suite of Force powers and other abilities.It\u2019s not as precise when it comes to combat as something like Sekiro, but it\u2019s also nowhere near as punishing as that game, so it should appeal to a much wider audience, especially given the different difficulty settings. Like Sekiro, it\u2019s entirely single-player. There is no multiplayer of any sort\u2014no invasions or co-op or anything of that nature, which is kind of incredible in this day and age.Exploration and combat were both great fun, even if many of the cosmetic items you found to deck out your ship, Cal\u2019s outfit and BD-1 were fairly lackluster. Exploring and finding a secret or a chest is just fun, and the great combination of wall-running, swinging from ropes or vines, climbing and leaping (and eventually double-jumping) all combine to make for a very engaging experience outside of combat.Combat itself is deep enough to never grow stale, though it\u2019s very much in the Souls vein rather than something more complex like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry. I\u2019m fine with that, but it\u2019s all down to personal taste.I loved many of the puzzles, some of which really reminded me of Zelda and Tomb Raider. And I enjoyed the story from start to finish, though this is still very much a gameplay-first title. The story is fine, but it\u2019s nothing to write home about either (though the end has a pretty great surprise).

It\u2019s quite impressive. I\u2019d love to see the studio try its hand at something like Mass Effect. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is one of the best Star Wars games I\u2019ve ever played and one of the best \u201cSoulslike\u201d games out there, surprising as that may sound. It\u2019s not as brutally challenging as FromSoftware\u2019s games (all too often imitators try too hard to replicate the challenge while missing everything else that makes those games so great) but it gets a great deal about the genre right, and that goes beyond combat to level design. For a first effort in this genre, it\u2019s pretty remarkable, and I hope Respawn makes a sequel that\u2019s even better.Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is absolutely one of my favorite games of 2019, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen OrderA review code was provided for the purposes of this review.\nShacknews, New to Shacknews? Signup for a Free AccountAlready have an account? Login NowStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a new single-player experience from Respawn Entertainment that doesn't quite stick the landing. Our review.Tackling the Star Wars franchise is never easy. Between all of the movies, animated TV shows, and the wealth of games, bringing something new and exciting to the table is tough. While the team at Respawn Entertainment have done a valiant job at crafting a new experience in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and although its story has its moments and the combat has finesse, it seems to struggle finding its place at the table.Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is set between the catastrophic events of Episode III and the hopeful days of Episode IV. The story kicks off at a breakneck pace. Cal Kestis \u2013 the player-controlled character \u2013 is Force-sensitive and in hiding. A close call at work (he\u2019s a scrapper who decommissions ships) thrusts Cal into a fight for his life and once again sees him fleeing from the Empire. Pursuing him is the Second Sister, the leader of The Inquisitorius and the main villain of the game.From here, Cal teams up with a crew consisting of a captain called Greez and Cere, a woman with a mysterious past. Fleeing forever isn\u2019t an appealing option, so Cal joins Cere\u2019s cause: hunting down a holocron that contains the whereabouts of all known Force-sensitive kids in the hopes of creating a new Jedi order.One of the main characters you'll be spending the most time with is BD-1. This little droid sits perched on your back, dispensing health stims. When it's not on your back, it's off scanning pieces of lore, being used as a powered zipline, or projecting out a holographic map of the planet.For a story that starts with a bang, it really does struggle to maintain momentum. The middle of the story is a bit of a drag as you skip from planet to planet, chasing the memory fragments of a former Jedi Master, all in the hopes of finding the holocron. Along the way, Cal wrestles with his inner demons and questions his whole purpose. It\u2019s a standard song and dance that fans of Star Wars should be quite familiar with.What comes as a surprise is just how safe the story is in Fallen Order. Outside of a few impressive moments, the story rarely challenges the player or explores uncharted waters.One of the places where Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order shines is in its combat. The combat is a little more purposeful in Fallen Order than previous Star Wars titles.

This challenge changes based on the difficulty selected and at some lower levels it\u2019s still somewhat possible to mash your way through.Beyond the lowly Stormtroopers and creatures, enemies have a stamina bar and health bar. In order to deal health damage, Cal must whittle down this stamina bar by attacking with lightsaber or the Force. Once depleted, the enemy is entirely vulnerable to being killed.In boss fights, once the stamina bar is broken, it will regenerate after a few hits have been landed. It becomes a dance of chipping away at the stamina and then going in to strike, all while avoiding attacks.Avoiding attacks comes down to positioning and blocking. Cal will need to side-step or roll out of the way, jump over attacks, or deflect and block incoming assaults. Perfectly deflecting an attack rewards the highest stamina damage, but it also takes the most skill. Thankfully, the aforementioned difficulty levels change the deflection window timing, outgoing damage, and incoming damage.To further spice up the combat, new abilities can be learned via the skill tree. This is accessible when using one of the many, generously placed meditation circles. There\u2019s also the option to rest, refilling your health charges (stim canisters) and Force meter, and resetting all the enemies in the level.As for the skill tree, it includes three paths focusing on the Force, your lightsaber, and Cal\u2019s health. Unlocking a Force ability means being able to push larger enemies, cause things to slow down for longer, and increase your Force meter. Lightsaber abilities include throwing out your blade, a strong over-head attack, and blocking blasters while running. Health upgrades are your standard health increases and how much health you get from stim canisters.While the combat has its finesses, it unfortunately doesn\u2019t offer up anything new and unique. Probably the most interesting thing you can do was already shown off in some gameplay: slowing down a laser blast and using Force pull to put an enemy in front of it.The same can be said about the Force. No new or exciting abilities are on display outside of the previously-mentioned slow effect. There are no great displays of Force use, like pulling a Star Destroyer out of the sky \u00e0 la Force Unleashed.Much like previous Star Wars games, there is still no dismemberment for human enemies. Dealing a death blow on a creature might result in it being cleaved in half or have its horn cut off, but humans never so much as bleed after being slashed across the gut with a lightsaber.In the event you\u2019re on the receiving end of a thrashing and you die, all the XP and unspent skill points you had are absorbed by the enemy that killed you. To get this back, you just need to hit the enemy.But one mechanic that Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has that will forever grind my gears is a respawn screen. This screen asks the question, \u201cRespawn?\u201d and only offers one option: continue. Play on a harder difficulty and you could be seeing this screen a lot. This respawn confirmation screen simply gets in the way of getting back to the game.One of the differences between Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and other Star Wars titles is its terrain traversal. Cal is able to double-jump, swing on vines, and run across walls. These mechanics are used to great effect in the few dungeon-like areas where new Force abilities are learned and between major areas of a planet.Unfortunately, Fallen Order isn\u2019t as open-world as it first appears. There\u2019s no plotting out your own course between areas. Each connection is a pre-made deconstructed hallway consisting of set wall-runs and vine-swing spots.These are great to move through the first time, but on subsequent visits to the same area you\u2019ll be wishing you had more freedom to choose your own path.The reason you will be visiting the same area repeatedly is due to the clear Metroidvania influence. As you learn new abilities or when BD-1 acquires a new tool, previously locked-off areas will become available for exploration. This encourages the player to return to old planets to see what lies behind those once inaccessible locations.The problem with this is that navigating around these planets isn\u2019t as easy and carefree as it could be. You wind up spending a lot of time staring at the 3-dimensional map, trying to work out what connects to where and how you\u2019re going to reach the other side of the planet.It just winds up being tiring having to return to a planet two or three times, run to the new location, and then work your way back to the ship.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6da9291-9fcb-4ad9-ad6b-1211a7bde261": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6da9291-9fcb-4ad9-ad6b-1211a7bde261", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ecb3cda-8630-4f9c-8a96-ed5d697d9951", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8cd6bcd742bd905bb81f1d73496d3822a27dc2c5f3557bea5232c9f63991415"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b5ae3e7-7894-411f-8f6c-b0d8e51322ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d82b233a3027357f4c665f24de9e5da95f0883039895a4bab5aa50833ef0f4a4"}}, "hash": "58ef301c5f240c4d07ec09031adee72f8d1865fca7b95a592b9dcbaa46108492", "text": "It would have been so nice to have a quick travel option, even one as simple as allowing the player to return to the ship.Sometimes you might get lucky and have a shortcut unlocked. This is great and often amounts to a couple of elevator rides. But between these, the movement doesn\u2019t feel nearly as slick as one might expect, especially when the likes of Titanfall and Apex Legends are in the developer\u2019s vernacular.There were also some frustrating moments when trying to explore a planet. In one instance, a vine was needed to swing across a chasm. Instead of pressing forward, I turned around to see a giant tree branch behind me. Thinking there might be a chest hidden there, I swung to it only to clip through the non-physical tree and fall to my death.The fa\u00e7ade of exploration quickly falls away whenever something like this happens. It\u2019s disappointing, because the environments are gorgeous and worth taking the time to appreciate.In terms of your reward for exploring, sometimes it's a boost to your health or Force meter, but most of the time it\u2019s a new cosmetic, of which there are many. Players can unlock new colors for Cal\u2019s clothing and poncho and new paint jobs for the Mantis and BD-1. There are also dozens of lightsaber pieces you can find. You can mix and match all kinds of emitters, switches, sleeves and materials to create the lightsaber you want to use.What makes a Star Wars experience really pop is its sound design. The distinctive hum and clash of lightsabers is enough to get any Star Wars fan raring to go, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order takes the sound design to the next level.Pulling out Cal\u2019s lightsaber and hearing it hum to life is fantastic. Even when catching an elevator ride, you\u2019ll wind up whipping out the lightsaber just to hear it thrumming.It\u2019s just as pleasing to listen to in combat. Deflecting blaster shots, clashing with other lightsaber-wielders, and hacking droids apart all sound incredible. Even the Force has a deep, reverberating tone as you push and pull enemies around.As for the soundtrack, it is immediately recognizable and will likely ignite the nostalgia. Each area has its own distinctive theme and action sequences are heightened by the music.Outside of personal preferences when it comes to terrain traversal, combat, and story, there were also a host of bugs and glitches. Some of these were minimal, like characters\u2019 feet sinking into the ground, but on more than one occasion a game reset was needed in order to ensure advancement was made.In one of the earliest sections, Cal had to learn a wall-running ability in order to progress. This involved completing a tutorial where the skill was introduced. Each time I ran at the wall and attempted to perform the manoeuvre, Cal would run on the spot or the camera would freak out, causing him to fall.Another instance saw the Mantis ship land and open the incorrect door. The ramp led into an out-of-bounds area, preventing me from actually entering the playable space and interacting with the NPCs.At one point in the story, a cutscene triggered, but instead of the cinematic starting, I was stuck below the map. The underside of the level filled my screen, backlit by the starry night sky. I was unable to move save for the ability to spin the camera around.Unfortunately, the experience was also marred by severe frame drops and crashes. It\u2019s easy enough to overlook some glitches and hiccups, but these only sought to shine a spotlight on a game that just feels a bit average.While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has some exciting combat and moments of genuinely interesting storytelling and acting, it just falls short of hitting the mark. It borrows heavily from several genres without actually adding anything new to the conversation. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s bad, it just didn\u2019t leave me wanting to revisit this galaxy.This review is based on an Xbox One code provided by the publisher.

You can reductively call it Star Wars Uncharted; you do a fair bit of climbing on the side of buildings looking for a ledge to hold onto as you plan your next jump.It\u2019s Star Wars Souls, with tactical combat that requires careful blocking, dodging and occasionally parrying to get the most of. Perhaps it\u2019s even Star Wars Raider, with its own self-contained puzzle areas that are literally ancient tombs.Where it\u2019s easy to view Fallen Order as an unoriginal mishmash of ideas, I instead see it as a successful attempt at marrying distinct systems from other games and presenting them in a coherent way.Fallen Order\u2019s story follows Cal Kestis, a Jedi-in-training forced into hiding as a young boy at the collapse of the Galactic Republic and the ensuing purge of the Jedi. The game\u2019s entire story is motivated by events that occur in the prequel trilogy, but a cursory look at that era\u2019s biggest moments is enough to get you on board with the premise.One of the narrative\u2019s strongest elements is that it doesn\u2019t rely on iconic characters, or any major events beyond Order 66. Star Wars heroes like Obi-Wan are briefly shown or mentioned, without the usual reverence Star Wars fiction tends to bring to their appearances. There\u2019s one exception to that towards the very end of the game, but it was unexpected, short and incredibly well-executed, but ultimately doesn't matter to the general story.After hooking up with a former Jedi (Cere) who blocked herself off from the Force, a loveable and high-strung ship captain (Greez), and an incredibly adorable little droid (BD-1), the four go on an adventure that would see them use Greez's ship to travel to different planets chasing, well, McGuffins. With the exception of one late arrival, each of the four characters are given time to grow and evolve before the credits roll. BD-1, a droid who only speaks in bleeps and boops, is, for my money, this year\u2019s best new character. I have to give special attention to his voice direction - and my god, every little animation he plays \u2013 both of which build up his character as an inquisitive, brave little robot. Respawn just has a thing for creating cordial robots. I will forever cherish this journey just as I do with Titanfall 2\u2019s BT-7274.The general setup of visiting the remnants of an ancient civilisation to obtain items or power intended to deal with a modern problem, only to find said civilisation had issues of its own, is familiar and ends up having little bearing on the narrative. The main force propelling me forward wasn't so much the need to get the things, as it was to spend more time with these incredibly well-realised characters and visit alien planets.\n\nYou control where the ship goes, which opens up the game in wonderful ways. Taking inspiration from Metroid and Souls, many areas on these planets will only be accessible after obtaining certain Force powers. Dangling ropes require a pull, cracked walls require a push to crumble, and so on.This means you\u2019ll be travelling back and forth between the different planets even as more of them become accessible. The game certainly isn\u2019t shy about sending you to one planet for a single mission, and off to another for the next, but you don\u2019t always need to follow the quest marker if you don\u2019t want to.I visited Dathomir first, a mid-to-endgame planet. Got an important item just by exploring, before realising that most pathways are blocked, and that enemies are very tough. Clearly, I was in the wrong place at that point, but I managed to get something out of it. This very item is available at a different point through normal story progression, so it\u2019s great to see Respawn offer players the freedom to obtain it so early.As more areas of the different planets open up, zones become a complicated mess of shortcuts and multi-level structures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3aa0d7aa-a1d7-4079-b825-655476de7f11": {"__data__": {"id_": "3aa0d7aa-a1d7-4079-b825-655476de7f11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b5ae3e7-7894-411f-8f6c-b0d8e51322ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d82b233a3027357f4c665f24de9e5da95f0883039895a4bab5aa50833ef0f4a4"}, "3": {"node_id": "fae5d07d-5e5c-4f61-836a-bdaf6cd107b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "09f4b5a704945d912d4c8e12ae23b0f502e164b61dd89033136ac7ecb6cb79b4"}}, "hash": "a79c4310b2ff199cbf1143bc6b040c8390caa868d8a63a679b9595feb26b260e", "text": "It\u2019s not as elegant as you might find in FromSoftware\u2019s work, which is what makes the map \u2013 available to you at any point \u2013 such a lifesaver.The map makes it simple to plot a course, know which pathways are accessible and which aren\u2019t. They\u2019re even colour-coded so you know if the ones blocked off require an item or if they need to be accessed from the opposite end. It\u2019s a more complicated version of Resident Evil 2 Remake\u2019s map, and alleviates some of the frustrations players will have with navigating these enormous levels late-game. A fast travel system would take care of all problems entirely, but one doesn\u2019t exist here. If you miss a shortcut, you could spend minutes trekking it across a massive area just to get back to your ship and watch a cutscene.In your adventures, you\u2019ll be mainly be attacked by three enemy factions. The wildlife: the most frustrating to fight because they\u2019re often in groups, and have harder-to-read attacks. Then there are Stormtroopers, many of whom die in a single strike, though others more equipped to fight in melee will pose a bigger challenge. Neither of these are as demanding as the Purge Troopers, however - units specifically trained to hunt Jedi.Those not only offer the biggest challenge, they\u2019re mostly armed with melee weapons, so understanding their attack patterns and responding in kind is more manageable.Fallen Order occasionally tries to ramp up the difficulty by mixing the three together, and it can get infuriating trying to work your way through these sort of combat puzzles, which are often more tedious than they are difficult.You\u2019re going to parry the basic trooper\u2019s bolts back at them, killing them in one hit. You\u2019ll watch for the melee trooper\u2019s very obvious tells to also get rid of them very quickly, and you\u2019ll use whatever Force powers you might have to push some off a cliff or slow down the rest so you can better control the crowd. After all is said and done, you\u2019ll be left with one or two Purge Troopers, only then can you have your duel and hopefully walk away victorious. I understand that these sort of encounters exist to allow players to live out the power fantasy, but on the two hardest difficulties (I finished it on Master), you\u2019re not given enough leeway for that. You need to approach it as you would a Souls fight because you have different considerations than someone playing The Force Unleashed 2019.A better way to handle that would have been to leave fodder enemies to the lower difficulty, and declutter the encounters for the higher ones. I would love to have spent much of my time duelling Purge Troopers, but now I have to get stun-locked for taking too many consecutive blaster shots.Fallen Order\u2019s combat borrows from Souls and Sekiro, but evidently sets its own rules. You don\u2019t have a stamina meter, so you can wail on an enemy essentially forever, although most enemies can block.You and your enemies all have a block meter, which drains the more hits are blocked. After it depletes, you'll need to disengage until it recharges, or go on the offensive. It\u2019s a simple enough setup that also allows for quick-stepping and full-on rolling, leaving you many avenues to escape danger. Where it falters is the execution. Enemy attacks track you a little too well, and can sometimes catch you through your roll or dodge. When this happens enough times, you\u2019ll begin defaulting to just holding the block button and waiting it out. This is certainly viable, but it\u2019s boring. The trick is instead in learning which attacks to roll through and which to block, which would make sense for a boss fight, but some consistency is required when fighting regular enemies.Another problem is how the game handles parrying, which you can do if you time it right. Parrying an attack in most action games is a major moment in a fight. There\u2019s often a loud sound cue and visual effects that trigger when you pull one off. Your opponents\u2019 guard will, too, be left open for a brief moment as a result of the parry. Fallen Order has a different, clunkier approach. The time it takes to get into the blocking stance is unnecessarily long, and you can\u2019t cancel into a parry. This caused my parries to fail, even if I was confident I have the timing right. By the same token, enemies don\u2019t really care about your parries, save for bottom-of-the-rung troopers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fae5d07d-5e5c-4f61-836a-bdaf6cd107b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fae5d07d-5e5c-4f61-836a-bdaf6cd107b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d2694f34-ae38-489f-826e-377ac9f316ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b9c5351b8be17b0c1266e78ed79ea2c2c09bf442026b6aed5cfc59fb41652f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "3aa0d7aa-a1d7-4079-b825-655476de7f11", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a79c4310b2ff199cbf1143bc6b040c8390caa868d8a63a679b9595feb26b260e"}, "3": {"node_id": "865d8b48-31c3-45c8-8851-e84e6b4f3c4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "15c3790b6d61d848edcd021ca44be4ecd135fe06ac78c4fa0e664f9f703c960a"}}, "hash": "09f4b5a704945d912d4c8e12ae23b0f502e164b61dd89033136ac7ecb6cb79b4", "text": "They\u2019ll often continue their combo unabated and you\u2019ll stand there taking damage wondering why your parries aren\u2019t working.Over time, I realised that the animation simply isn\u2019t fast enough to keep up with enemy attacks, so I got into a routine of parrying one or two and blocking the rest. The game signals unblockables with a clear red glow, but I found that regular long combos can be even more deadly. In fact, it was often easier to interrupt these perilous attacks with a Force push and use that window to attack. These little inconsistencies add up, and could\u2019ve soured me on the game if Force powers and some of the more elaborate Lightsaber moves didn\u2019t hook me. \n\nWhich brings us back around to execution. The different shortcomings in traversal that lead to perfectly safe jumps failing for no good reason, the limited field of view when sliding that causes you to misjudge leaps, and the aforementioned combat could all \u2013 at the game\u2019s worst moments \u2013 lead to frustration. Respawn clearly needed more time to brush off some of those edges, and it may get there eventually - but right now, lack of polish is holding Fallen Order back. These imperfections weren\u2019t enough to knock down my enjoyment, and I\u2019ve certainly ran into far fewer technical issues compared to players on consoles, but they will for many. But Fallen Order is a confident, focused game whose individual pieces try, even if they don\u2019t always win. The action may not be as exhilarating as the games Fallen Order is inspired by, its controls may not be as delicate, or its difficulty exacting \u2013 but Respawn dares; shooting for something worthy of being mentioned alongside those hallowed inspirations.And yes, it doesn't always get there in this one, but damn If I can\u2019t help but respect the effort. Fallen Order is a game whose worst moments are serviceable, and best moments are memorable. It\u2019s worth experiencing by Star Wars fans hungry for an original story that doesn\u2019t settle for trite, and action game players looking for a decent - albeit flawed \u2013 combat.Version tested: PC.\n        Sign in and unlock a world of features\n      \n        Get access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nSherif Saed\n\n          Contributor\n        Sherif is VG247\u2019s go-to shooter and Souls-likes person.
