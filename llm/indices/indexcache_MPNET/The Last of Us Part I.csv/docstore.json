Here\u2019s how it works.The PlayStation classic remains out of reach on PC due to debilitating performance issues.PC Gamer's got your back \n\n\nOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you. Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.What is it? A seminal PlayStation apocalyptic narrative adventure.Expect to pay: \u00a350/$60Release date: Out nowDeveloper: Naughty DogPublisher: PlayStation PCReviewed on: i7 9700K, RTX 2080 TI, 16GB RAMMultiplayer? NoLink: Official siteYou've heard by now, of course. Sony's unanimously adored 2013 stealth-action cry-along The Last Of Us Part 1 has not arrived on PC in fine form. The performance issues are numerous and significant, and over a week on from launch, despite two patches from developer Naughty Dog and a driver hotfix from Nvidia, they persist.\u00a0It was supposed to be so different. The internet's servers are heaving under the weight of all the Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal memes that The Last Of Us' TV adaptation has spawned, and this fortuitously timed PC release should have been our chance not just to play a celebrated classic in its best form, but to enjoy it as a companion piece to the hot HBO series of the hour.\u00a0It's not that. Instead, it's a battle against a shader cache that takes longer to load than even the most un-optimised console emulator you've downloaded from the darkest corners of retro gaming internet forums. There are reviews on the game's Steam page that claim the two-hour refund period expired before it had finished building its shaders, and they're not joking. Fortunately, Steam has made an exception and is offering refunds to any players who purchased TLOU, no questions asked. That's an indictment of quite how bad this launch situation is.I've installed the game three times on two different systems, and the absolute quickest I've seen TLOU complete its shader building is 40 minutes. The slowest, after the game's 1.0.1.6 patch incidentally, took well over two hours. I've seen users with RTX 4090s reporting shader build times of over an hour.\u00a0What happens if you don't wait until it's finished building its shaders? In my experience, a Last Of Us flip book. On both an RTX 2080 TI and a 3060, performance levels were so low with an incomplete shader cache that it was unplayable. And even if I could live with the chugging frame rate, the graphical artefacts all over the screen are really something to contend with. Joel's hair and eyebrows became squares of block colours in one cutscene for me. In another, Sarah's bedroom became a nightmare of floaty objects. After the shaders were compiled, I didn't notice any visual artefacts. The wait, then, is basically a mandatory one.On high graphics settings and above, this is the best the game has ever looked. But the frame rate at medium settings on both systems is inconsistent and, frankly, not much fun during combat sequences. Cycling between presets doesn't do much to alleviate choppiness, and aside from low preset I didn't notice a dramatic increase in frame rate.What I did notice, however, was that my CPU was being absolutely thrashed as I was running the game. My 2080 TI runs at 100% capacity in system resources, but more worryingly my i7 9700K\u2014hardly a 64-core monster but rarely a bottleneck in any other games I play\u2014was also at either 99% or 100% the entire time, as was my system memory. That's a recipe for freezes and crashes. In fairness, I've only ever experienced a CTD while alt-tabbing, but freezes are more commonplace on the streets of Boston. And don't get me started on load times.\u00a0All of this means that while the game's technically playable at launch, it's not enjoyable. It's several patches and driver updates away from enjoyable, in fact.\u00a0Sony's other PC ports have been exemplary lately, and although Horizon: Zero Dawn's shaders are also in no particular hurry to compile, the issue isn't anything like as pronounced as it is here. And given the fact this PC port was specifically delayed to allow time for further optimisation\u2014well, I'm bewildered.\u00a0You can see the detail and effort that's been poured into this version, too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18d137b5-e827-41c7-9c83-bde14000af38": {"__data__": {"id_": "18d137b5-e827-41c7-9c83-bde14000af38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3d855d9-a98d-400a-ad01-61c2d6a68dd0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "770fc45c9bf384747aff94526878979c3b222944fed9e408a38e47173da45fc5"}, "3": {"node_id": "f195c54b-d3c0-4f97-8922-6712a955efdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "27be7c26ff054e21d629782d90b9e7c120e81d6f7e3f6cdd62210cef34d74144"}}, "hash": "86e7b5a26d479542e183f5bac3bcaf4a885cfe7dc0f4b70862a2728d59039b91", "text": "You can see the detail and effort that's been poured into this version, too. The audio settings are as comprehensive as you'll ever find in a game's options menu, and although tweaking the graphics options isn't as clear and immediate as in, say, Resident Evil Village with its handy GDDR capacity counter, it's by no means a lightweight set of parameters to tweak. The issues didn't happen because nobody checked whether the game ran properly, or because the developers aren't diligent or hardworking. But still, here we are. \u00a0Let's talk about the game though, shall we? On the off chance it becomes playable in the near future. I happened to be on staff at Official PlayStation Magazine UK when it first launched in 2013, and the fervour for it around the office was something I've only known once or twice in my career. Here was a post-apocalyptic story seemingly of the kind the industry was already oversaturating us with\u2014urban areas 'being reclaimed by nature' were as ubiquitous in 2013 as bows and arrows\u2014but despite this it immediately stood out because it placed its focus on people, and did so to incredible effect.\u00a0The impact of TLOU's grown-up tone is lessened now in 2023, but that's partly because Naughty Dog's style of dialogue scripting and performance capture became so influential. \"This could be a movie or a TV show\" we all said to each other while that famous intro plays out. Sarah wakes up alone in a uniquely convincing home, paces about half-asleep while outside there are sirens and strange noises. With barely a word spoken, TLOU grounds you in a real-world setting and asserts that there will be no Uncharted eyebrow-waggling here.\u00a0Like 2013's other big game Bioshock Infinite, this is a study of fatherhood. Unlike the former with its infinite loops and bearded men fathering their own dads, Joel's story is stripped back, raw, and messy. That's what the apocalypse is so great at, as a setting\u2014cutting away all the extraneous noise from life and leaving only the absolute essentials. How does humanity prevail when all the infrastructure around it has been cut away? And most tricky of all: how do you hold on to your personal humanity?Joel's grieving. He's used that grief to his advantage, shutting his feelings off and doing what he needs to in order to survive. Until he's tasked with smuggling a 14-year-old girl who reminds him of his daughter, at which point some long-dormant paternal love awakens and both he and you are pulled in two directions\u2014you both want what's best for Ellie, but you have to commit some pretty monstrous acts to keep her safe. Every fight, you're trading away a bit of your humanity to preserve hers.\u00a0You really do have that sense, then and now. And what's especially impressive is that you're so emotionally invested, so early on, while mechanically the game's doing almost nothing to entertain you. In the opening two hours you're either walking from point to point while someone walks beside you explaining the world or moving a ladder into place. Take it from an old PlayStation mag alumnus\u2014this game might have the BAFTAs, but Uncharted works so much harder to keep you having fun on a mechanical level.When TLOU does ask more from you than deftly holding forwards on the left stick, its combat offers you a choice: go in with your shotgun drawn and make a mess, or scuttle about between cover, pop a home-made shiv in someone's unsuspecting neck and, well, make a quieter mess. Metal Gear Solid 5 is ain't, and never was, but the quality of animations and the weapon and item crafting systems elevate it above your typical meat-and-potatoes action game fights.\u00a0The fights were never meant to be stylish, of course. You're not Doomguy, hopping between elaborate melee moves in sync with a deathcore breakdown. You're a man in a shirt that looks like it smells bad, doing what you're absolutely forced to by the circumstances you find yourself in. As such, combat's never flamboyant and rarely particularly satisfying. And that, coupled with the unrelenting 'Manchester on a rainy Monday morning' colour palette, has always kept me slightly more at arm's length from TLOU than everyone else.\u00a0It's still an important part of gaming history. It's a significant moment, one in which a triple-A dev decided it would try to tell a story in as cinematic and grown-up a fashion as possible, with a focus on the subtleties of its performers.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, Sony\u2019s latest PC port is a disappointing follow-up to The Last Of Us TV show, and the worst version of the game so far.It\u2019s long been clear that the video games industry learned nothing from the disastrous launch of Cyberpunk 2077. Within months publishers had fully reverted to their old ways, releasing broken games long before they were finished, while being happy to let developers take the blame for decisions that were clearly out of their control. Given how much power Sony developer Naughty Dog wields though we\u2019re really not sure who\u2019s fault the PC version of The Last Of Us Part 1 is.Sony clearly knew that the game was broken at launch as they refused to send out review copies to anyone. As a result, the game released without any critical appraisal, and it was left to ordinary fans to discover that it was a broken mess. Naturally, Naughty Dog issued all the usual apologies \u2013 as if they somehow didn\u2019t know that the game was a disaster \u2013 and made the equally familiar promises to fix it all later.It\u2019s frustrating because this would have been the perfect opportunity to reassess The Last Of Us in light of the exceptional success of the HBO TV show. You can still do that to a degree, but the fact that this PC version is so full of bugs and visual glitches is the real story here.We do not make the comparisons with Cyberpunk 2077 lightly. The PC version suffers from almost every problem imaginable, and not just the weird shader issues with Joel\u2019s beard. The frame rate is highly unstable, the game crashes constantly, there\u2019s enough pop-in to make it look like a 90s tech demo, and, predictably, it suffers from the weird stuttering effect that has afflicted so many big budget PC games in the last year or so.Why this keeps happening is a mystery, as even given the cynical standards of video game publishers you\u2019d think they\u2019d care that the continual failures are undermining confidence in the entire big budget PC scene. And yet still things do not get better.Once the game does start working there are plenty of graphical options, including NVidia DLSS and AMD\u2019s equivalent FSR 2.2, and PC-only extras like ultra widescreen support, but that\u2019s irrelevant until the game is fixed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "26284e1a-7186-40af-971a-bf04a0556eb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "26284e1a-7186-40af-971a-bf04a0556eb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f195c54b-d3c0-4f97-8922-6712a955efdc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "27be7c26ff054e21d629782d90b9e7c120e81d6f7e3f6cdd62210cef34d74144"}, "3": {"node_id": "f85c8ed4-4c8d-4ed4-a0ab-b96ec1052a50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "676026373afb26f94d28c18c20fccc67b54f42ac10161bc83dbd07a2c17938a6"}}, "hash": "f666941d244e10c3d8f249e6b78964e6e379e2b8e1039a3e688aeae87471d628", "text": "Naughty Dog has already released updates but there\u2019s no indication of when exactly it\u2019ll be working properly.As for the game itself, it is functionally identical to the original PlayStation 5 release, which in turn changed very little from the original PlayStation 3 and 4 versions. When it first launched last August, it was deemed by many to be a waste of Naughty Dog\u2019s valuable time, not to mention unreasonably expensive given it\u2019s missing the multiplayer mode that was part of the original two versions.Playing the game again, after having seen the show, the most obvious change is how different Joel and Ellie are, both physically and mentally. They often speak the same lines in the show, but Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey play the characters very differently.The TV\u2019s version of Ellie (who is noticeably older) is so caustic it\u2019s often difficult to sympathise with her, while TV Joel is less competent and more emotional. By comparison, their growing friendship seems much more organic in the game, one of many occasions the story benefits from a longer running time.On paper, the TV\u2019s actors are better than the game\u2019s leads, but Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson inhabit the roles, as written, in a more convincing way \u2013 to the point where it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine how Part 2\u2019s story is going to play out in the show.The other obvious difference is that there\u2019s a lot more action in the game and a lot more Infected, who were originally a more straightforward zombie-by-a-different name style threat. Their appearances in the show are handled very well but they turn up so rarely it starts to undermine the premise, and you begin to wonder why everyone is having so much trouble rebuilding the world.Also, because there\u2019s so little action in the show, and so little evidence that Joel is a capable fighter, the ending just doesn\u2019t work as well. Not only does Joel\u2019s sudden change in temperament come out of nowhere but so do his combat skills, which in the game are already well proven by that point.It\u2019s notable that the best episode of the TV show \u2013 episode three with Nick Offerman \u2013 is also the one that deviates the most from the game, elevating a throwaway character from the game into someone much more interesting.It\u2019s already become a clich\u00e9 to suggest that the reason The Last Of Us works so well as a TV show is because it\u2019s already a linear narrative, with an emphasis on cinematic storytelling, but there\u2019s a lot of truth to that. The third person stealth and simple combat of the games has never been the draw, and likewise Naughty Dog has never attempted to make the storytelling interactive. You have little control over where to go and none over any of the key decisions\u2026 much like watching TV.The Last Of Us, when it\u2019s working, is a superb storytelling experience but like so many narrative games it achieves this by abandoning a great deal of what makes video games a unique medium. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t compelling, but the game does sacrifice an awful lot to achieve its success.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationOne benefit it does have over the show, though, is that it doesn\u2019t have to cram the story into just a small number of episodes. The show does and it often seems very rushed as a result, with the game able to take its time with scenes and character building without always having an eye on the clock.It\u2019s easy to make the argument that the video game is still the superior version of the story but this is most certainly not the superior version of the game. Perhaps it will be eventually but at the moment there\u2019s no way the PC edition can be recommend, almost as if it\u2019s infected with some deadly fungus itself.In Short: The game is as compelling as ever, and this is an interesting opportunity to compare it with the TV show, but at launch this is one of the worst PC ports from any major publisher in a long while.Pros: The storytelling remains top tier and is arguably better than the TV show. Competent, if unremarkable, gameplay. At some point the graphics will probably look great on the PC.Cons: Riddled with bugs at launch, including crashes, stuttering, uneven frame rates, and absurd visual glitches.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f85c8ed4-4c8d-4ed4-a0ab-b96ec1052a50": {"__data__": {"id_": "f85c8ed4-4c8d-4ed4-a0ab-b96ec1052a50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "26284e1a-7186-40af-971a-bf04a0556eb4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f666941d244e10c3d8f249e6b78964e6e379e2b8e1039a3e688aeae87471d628"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d6c0f59-ad6c-45d5-a91b-1f7e2c9bd9e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "daf616108ec073660f3e2f8e4353dd137c576b73b28b7f6de77e4a01add13047"}}, "hash": "676026373afb26f94d28c18c20fccc67b54f42ac10161bc83dbd07a2c17938a6", "text": "Still no multiplayer mode or new content.Score: 4/10Formats: PCPrice: \u00a349.99Publisher: PlayStation PCDeveloper: Naughty Dog and Iron GalaxyRelease Date: 28th March 2023Age Rating: 18Email\u00a0gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and\u00a0follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : The Last Of Us nearly got a spin-off game about Ellie\u2019s mum says creator\n\n\n\n\tMORE : The Last of Us season 1 episode 9 ending explained as finale draws from video game for stomach-churning conclusion\n\n\n\n\tMORE : What The Last Of Us gained and lost from its HBO adaptation\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and email us at\u00a0gamecentral@metro.co.ukTo submit Inbox letters and Reader\u2019s Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our\u00a0Submit Stuff page here.For more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGamesRadar+, When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

The birthday present, the wake-up call, the desperate drive into town\u2026 it's all very much charted territory at this point. And yet, by some magic, that reliable crutch of familiarity is gone in The Last of Us Part 1 on PS5, yanked away by the breathtaking detail that refashions every frame, leaving you as vulnerable to the sequence's raw deluge of emotions as you were when playing it for the very first time.\u00a0Release date: September 2, 2022\nPlatform(s):\u00a0PS5\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nPublisher:\u00a0PlayStation StudiosThe hysteria of societal breakdown heaves under the weight of an atmosphere rendered more oppressive by cutting-edge lighting and physics. The horror of the newly infected\u2019s screams, a gargled cocktail of rabid rage and abject fear, is heightened thanks to 3D audio that pinpoints their location with terrifying accuracy. And then there's the opening's final moments, where the anguish of a father's grief is more palpable than ever \u2013 the previously hidden nuances of Troy Baker's performance brought to the fore by Part 1's hyperreal facial animation. \u00a0The Last of Us Part 1 has had a hard time justifying its existence in the run-up to release. Certainly, even as someone who usually takes any excuse to replay The Last of Us for the umpteenth time, and has now seen this remake through to the end credits, I'm not going to try and convince you that Naughty Dog's latest offering is necessarily worth its brow-raising asking price.\u00a0And yet, despite itself, there's treasure to be unearthed in The Last of Us Part 1, even if it doesn't quite reach the same pedigree of Naughty Dog's previous work. This remake might not be the most compelling of sales propositions for PS5 owners, then, but it is nonetheless a fascinating case study for the power that technology can have in elevating the impact of interactive storytelling. \u00a0Once a self-explanatory label, the video game remake now resembles a broad church of competing ideas and approaches, encompassing everything from simple restorations to revisionist overhauls. Naturally, this evolution has given rise to a steady stream of contentious questions surrounding the genre's very identity.\u00a0How long is an appropriate amount of time before a game should be remade? Where do you draw the line between modernising antiquated mechanics and tampering with an experience's very identity? And as remastering technology continues to evolve \u2013 able to effortlessly boost frame rates, resolutions, and plenty more \u2013 is there even a future where remakes need to exist?\u00a0Ever the poster child for heated video game debate, The Last of Us has turned the salience of these questions up to 11 with the release of Part 1, asking PS5 players to invest $70/\u00a360 in a largely by-the-book remake that brings Naughty Dog's survival horror masterpiece more aesthetically in line with its own 2020 sequel.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d6c0f59-ad6c-45d5-a91b-1f7e2c9bd9e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d6c0f59-ad6c-45d5-a91b-1f7e2c9bd9e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f85c8ed4-4c8d-4ed4-a0ab-b96ec1052a50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "676026373afb26f94d28c18c20fccc67b54f42ac10161bc83dbd07a2c17938a6"}, "3": {"node_id": "2acfa6a4-98f9-4fd4-909a-b99e8b9ec611", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5569af8d7713be6173d3b659bf420d9e79f84aae99d99223417538865f6b9e8"}}, "hash": "daf616108ec073660f3e2f8e4353dd137c576b73b28b7f6de77e4a01add13047", "text": "With that price tag, many may have expected an all-inclusive reimagining of The Last of Us, which itself had already been remastered for PS4 in 2014, but Naughty Dog has instead opted to focus on an almost exclusively cosmetic update at the expense of any deep, systemic overhauls. \u00a0That does mean, at least, that when it comes to visual facelifts, The Last of Us Part 1 is pulling no punches. Environments look like they've been dip-dyed in lashings of new-gen varnish, offering fresh details to take in and immersive auras to soak up. NPCs who appear for barely a few seconds look more detailed and expressive than Joel or Ellie ever possibly could have on the PS3. Updated character models are able to give a more authentic representation of the original performances from Naughty Dog's mo-cap stage, revealing previously hidden, understated body language and facial expressions that enrich the subtext of key moments across the story.\u00a0Not a single asset has been ignored from Naughty Dog's attentive treatment, in fact, and the results are phenomenal \u2013 not just in comparison to the original game, but to more contemporary exclusives across the entire spectrum of the PS5 catalogue. Granted, there's the odd moment where The Last of Us Part 1's identity as a seventh-generation title disguised in the garb of new-gen tech spills clumsily onto the screen (particularly in cutscenes, where awkward animation betrays the authenticity of supremely detailed character models) but, for the most part, this is an incredibly accomplished visual refurbishment.\u00a0For better and worse, The Last of Us Part 1 is a remake where what you see is pretty much what you get. This isn't to say that no tweaks have been made beneath the game's shiny surface, but their impact upon the player experience isn't as groundbreaking as one might hope; resulting in steadier, smoother, and more accessible play, certainly, but nothing beyond the sum of its additive, commonsense iterations. \u00a0Naughty Dog has spoken about much about the updates to Part 1's AI programming, for example, building it off of the basis of The Last of Us 2's ultra intelligent NPCs. Yet, aside from companions now behaving more sensibly during stealth scenes (Ellie finally seems to understand that running out of cover right in front of an enemy patrol probably isn't the smartest idea), I never felt like a combat sequence played drastically different to how I remember. I've no doubt that foes fight harder and smarter than they used to, but I'd be lying if I said it felt as though their new behaviour made for any significantly game changing shake-ups to The Last of Us' already exhilarating combat.There are a few extra pieces of content, too, including new costumes for Joel and Ellie, viewable diorama models to be unlocked, and special modes such as Permadeath and Speedrunning, but these aren't so much essential features of a remake as they are addendums that could have been patched into the original game a long time ago. PS5 specific features, including use of the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, are a more welcome addition, at least, as is the option to select between a Performance or Fidelity graphics mode that prioritises framerate or resolution quality respectively.\u00a0And while there are a handful of creative flourishes here and there, including some appreciated efforts to make The Last of Us Part 1 and Part 2 feel like a more cohesive whole, this is nonetheless a beat-for-beat retelling of the same story. It's a shame, especially when other studios like Capcom are exemplifying the way in which remakes can be an opportunity to remix a much-loved tale for audiences new and old.\u00a0Still, perhaps there's just as much value in being able to infer new readings from a well-known story thanks to technology that has finally caught up with its creator's original vision. A somewhat self-indulgent hypothesis on Naughty Dog's part, to be sure, but when you're marvelling at The Last of Us Part 1's cutscenes in all their lavish glory, it's one that's difficult to argue against. \u00a0The Last of Us Part 1 is, perhaps more than anything, a gorgeous visual love letter to its biggest fans, not to mention a welcoming set of open arms for the inevitable stream of new ones who will arrive to the game via the upcoming Last of Us TV Show from HBO next year. Judged in isolation, that's far from a bad thing. But in the context of an industry where remakes are continuing to push the boundaries of the art of restoration, Part 1 struggles to escape the shadow of feeling like a bit of a missed opportunity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2acfa6a4-98f9-4fd4-909a-b99e8b9ec611": {"__data__": {"id_": "2acfa6a4-98f9-4fd4-909a-b99e8b9ec611", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d6c0f59-ad6c-45d5-a91b-1f7e2c9bd9e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "daf616108ec073660f3e2f8e4353dd137c576b73b28b7f6de77e4a01add13047"}, "3": {"node_id": "a85109ee-6e79-49fb-b3b6-b4c6e11ccaaa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "036f1dfd490dbcd7ca3aca8045a5d34e9b582dc578e4c199407594143bd347a5"}}, "hash": "f5569af8d7713be6173d3b659bf420d9e79f84aae99d99223417538865f6b9e8", "text": "Still, one of the most polished and best looking missed opportunities of the current generation is hardly an unappetising prospect for PS5 owners, especially when platform exclusives remain frustratingly rare this far into the console's lifecycle.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, After being released on PS3 and remastered for PS4 the original The Last Of Us has been remade for PS5, but what has actually changed?There\u2019s only one question anyone wants answered with The Last Of Us Part 1 and that\u2019s\u2026 why? The original is rightly regarded as a modern classic and while being nine years old makes it sound relatively ancient, it was released right at the end of the PlayStation 3 era and in terms of visuals was well ahead of its time. A year later it was remastered for the PlayStation 4, a version which many complained was overly expensive and offered no substantial improvements. And now history is repeating itself on the PlayStation 5.Back in 2014, remasters were all the rage but now remakes are more fashionable, primarily because the difference a remaster makes from one generation to the next has become largely trivial. A remake is essentially a brand new game and that combined with the passage of time has convinced Sony to charge full price for this new version, almost doubling the cost of the game from its original release.The Last Of Us Part 1 is not only the most expensive version of the game ever but also the most content light, since it completely removes the multiplayer element \u2013 no doubt because there\u2019s a standalone multiplayer game coming next year. At the same time, essentially nothing has changed about the core gameplay, so since we\u2019ve reviewed the game twice already, we\u2019ll be focusing primarily on the remake itself.For anyone that has not played The Last Of Us before our review of the remaster still holds true (minus the multiplayer), but in short the game is mechanically very similar to the Uncharted series, with a little less platforming and a lot more stealth. Which is to say it\u2019s a third person action adventure with a focus on cinematic presentation and relatively simple mechanics that are very welcoming to casual gamers.The majority of the story takes place 20 years after a zombie apocalypse, with you taking the role of embittered survivor Joel, as he\u2019s tasked with escorting a young girl named Ellie to meet with a government resistance group called the Fireflies.It\u2019s implied that Joel has done many questionable things to survive over the last two decades, but a father-daughter bond quickly begins to grow between the pair, as they avoid both zombies (caused by fungal infections) and fellow survivors. The third person action is solid, but the real appeal of the game is the two central characters and the performances by Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson.It\u2019s not just the fact that the remake costs \u00a370/$70 that seems so preposterous but the fact that Naughty Dog, who have only made three new, full-priced games in the last decade, should waste their time on such an unnecessary endeavour \u2013 one that could have been, and according to rumour initially was, given to someone else to handle.There are lots of good reasons to remake a video game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a85109ee-6e79-49fb-b3b6-b4c6e11ccaaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "a85109ee-6e79-49fb-b3b6-b4c6e11ccaaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "2acfa6a4-98f9-4fd4-909a-b99e8b9ec611", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5569af8d7713be6173d3b659bf420d9e79f84aae99d99223417538865f6b9e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d7fff2a-8e54-42e7-8cc7-cf4a45351fcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d37288c9bc6e616d5fad50952fdeb7d442759c4409220a48508f33aaaf3aec9"}}, "hash": "036f1dfd490dbcd7ca3aca8045a5d34e9b582dc578e4c199407594143bd347a5", "text": "Given how quickly they can age, the graphics alone can be a good enough excuse, but if a game\u2019s as old as, say, Resident Evil 2 it inevitably also has outdated controls, interfaces, and other issues. Which is why Capcom\u2019s remake was so warmly received, as it updated everything and yet still managed to keep the same tone and basic gameplay as the original.Age alone isn\u2019t the only consideration though. Sony\u2019s own Shadow Of The Colossus and Demon\u2019s Souls were both only a little over a decade old when they were remade but the originals had such significant performance issues that a remake made perfect sense. That was especially true as they didn\u2019t involve taking time away from the original developers and, especially in the case of Demon\u2019s Souls, greatly raised the profile of a game that on its original release was completely ignored by the mainstream.None of this applies to The Last Of Us. The PlayStation 4 remaster has aged extremely gracefully and under more sensible circumstances would be used as a clear example of why remakes sometimes aren\u2019t necessary. There are so many good reasons not to have a remake of The Last Of Us it\u2019s genuinely difficult to answer the question of why it exists.Of course, there\u2019s the glib acknowledgement that it exists solely to make money, but an almost equal amount could probably have been made from a much simpler remaster. The other reason is, presumably, that this is intended as a companion to the upcoming HBO show. Although the idea that non-gamers, intrigued by the show, would\u2019ve turned away in disgust at the PlayStation 4 era graphics (or bought a PlayStation 5 just to play it) is patently absurd.In Naughty Dog\u2019s mind, perhaps they felt they wanted to lessen the difference between Part 1 and Part 2 but it was never so significant that there\u2019s any kind of visual whiplash when playing the two in quick succession. And despite everyone assuming they\u2019d make the remake\u2019s combat identical to Part 2 they haven\u2019t, which isn\u2019t a problem but it is another odd decision to add to the pile.All the talk of improved graphics and DualSense support ignores the fact that it was the narrative journey of its characters that turned everything upside down in the sequel, not any radical change in the graphics or gameplay. That\u2019s why the two games are so renowned, and that aspect hasn\u2019t changed one iota in the remake.The graphics are improved, there\u2019s no question of that, but never to any significant degree. Like most remakes and remasters all they do is keep pace with your memories and if you\u2019re not studying a comparison video at the time, you\u2019d swear they hadn\u2019t changed at all.The backdrops and lighting are undoubtedly better, but the changes to the character models and faces are not the major leap forward that Sony and Naughty Dog seem to think they are. They\u2019re barely any closer to being photorealistic and that largely seems to be down to the limits of the nine-year-old motion capture data and the original art style.Joel in particular almost looks like a caricature, with his square shoulders and painterly features. The weird crab walk he does when you spin the camera also looks peculiarly awkward and old-fashioned, for what\u2019s supposed to be a state-of-the-art remake.It\u2019s the world, rather than the characters, that benefits most from the upgrade, with clever details like cars where the suspension is still working as you clamber over them and the way the water moves when you wade through it. Although the bisected zombies that now crawl along the floor at you are perhaps the most impactful addition.That and changes to how the artificial intelligence work are the closest the game gets to any fundamental gameplay changes, although, as with the graphical changes, the fact that all the enemies are now more dynamic and independent doesn\u2019t feel notably different from the original. Ally characters have less of a tendency to creep around in plain sight, when they\u2019re supposed to be hiding, though, which was a common problem with the original.There are new features but they\u2019re tiny things like a speedrun mode, concept art, and unlockable skins and gameplay modifiers. You also get the admirable range of new accessibility options from Part 2. And yet, strangely, the main menu shows selections in an almost imperceptibly different shade of white \u2013 which makes getting to the menu, to change the menu, peculiarly difficult.Given that the PlayStation 4 remaster is still easily available for a fraction of the price (it\u2019s also free with PS Plus Premium) it\u2019s very hard to justify The Last Of Us Part 1 as a sensible alternative.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d7fff2a-8e54-42e7-8cc7-cf4a45351fcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d7fff2a-8e54-42e7-8cc7-cf4a45351fcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "a85109ee-6e79-49fb-b3b6-b4c6e11ccaaa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "036f1dfd490dbcd7ca3aca8045a5d34e9b582dc578e4c199407594143bd347a5"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e6873e8-4e91-4535-9ca5-48160c386c15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8034b50a91e899abe2e132f32237ccdbfd0de8d160c83e56a0a8dd02974e4694"}}, "hash": "5d37288c9bc6e616d5fad50952fdeb7d442759c4409220a48508f33aaaf3aec9", "text": "That doesn\u2019t mean the underlining game isn\u2019t still good, it\u2019s just this ludicrously expensive way of playing it is one only for superfans and the idle rich.Incredibly, the Digital Deluxe Edition is even more expensive, at an eye-watering \u00a380/$80, and yet it also includes absolutely nothing new, just early unlocks for things like explosive arrows and weapon skins. A fact we still can\u2019t believe, as we double-checked the listing multiple times, convinced we must\u2019ve missed something.The far more interesting question than why this remake exists is whether The Last Of Us itself still deserves its classic status, since it\u2019s not just graphics and gameplay that can lose their lustre over time but the underlying design.What might be surprising to those that haven\u2019t played the game before, is that the plot is deceptively workmanlike. The set-up is that of a bog standard zombie post-apocalypse and a lot of the middle section of the game can be very generic, elevated only by Naughty Dog\u2019s cinematic presentation and the excellent performances of the actors.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakXbox will be less hands-off with Bethesda amid major reorganisationWhere the game excels is at the beginning and the end, when the story is at its most unpredictable, with the finale raising all sorts of interesting questions about the empathy, grief, and the selfishness of familial love. Whatever faults you might find with the game, its narrative highs are exceptional and it\u2019s still only its sequel which can claim to equal the emotional impact and sheer craft of its storytelling.This doesn\u2019t come without cost though, both literally and figuratively. While the finale revolves around a single, vital decision, you have no control over it at all. Naughty Dog stories are never interactive and, especially with the HBO show coming up, there\u2019s an important discussion to be had as to whether The Last Of Us actually gains anything from being a video game, rather than a movie or TV show.You could say that the level of immersion is greater by being a game, and that by virtue of this remake having better graphics that is increased, but that\u2019s really the only argument in its favour. This is clearly the definitive version of The Last Of Us, and yet the changes are so trivial it\u2019s hard to recommend to anyone.In Short: A completely pointless remake of one of the best games of the last decade, except with only half the content and at double the price.Pros: One of the best linear narratives ever in a video game, with superb performances and incredible presentation. Solid, if unremarkable, action. Excellent graphics, even if at first glance they don\u2019t seem to have changed much.Cons: Unreasonably expensive. No multiplayer mode and no new content. The graphical changes are more impressive on a technical level than an artistic one and make little difference.Score: 8/10Formats: PlayStation 5 (reviewed) and PCPrice: \u00a369.99Publisher: Sony Interactive EntertainmentDeveloper: Naughty DogRelease Date: 2nd September 2022 (PC TBC)Age Rating: 18Email\u00a0gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and\u00a0follow us on Twitter.\n\n\tMORE : The Last Of Us PC debut will come \u2018very soon\u2019 after PS5 launch \u2013 fans unconvinced\n\n\n\n\tMORE : The Last Of Us remake footage shows no gameplay changes despite \u2018hurtful\u2019 leaks\n\n\n\n\tMORE : The Last Of Us multiplayer spin-off will be as big as the single-player games says Naughty Dog\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0and email us at\u00a0gamecentral@metro.co.ukTo submit Inbox letters and Reader\u2019s Features more easily, without the need to send an email, just use our\u00a0Submit Stuff page here.For more stories like this,\u00a0check our Gaming page.Sign up to all the exclusive gaming content, latest releases before they're seen on the site.Get us in your feed\nGameSpot, The Last of Us Part I manages to tell a harrowing story of loss and redemption that still holds up despite some of its dated level design.

His clothes and features are the same, but there's a quiet, unmistakable torment imprinted on his face. I've played The Last of Us nearly a dozen times across PS3 and PS4, and I had never seen it worn so plainly. I know Joel has a troubled past because The Last of Us Part I goes out of its way to show you a traumatic death in the opening scene, but that pain was never etched into his facial features this clearly.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: The Last of Us Part I Video ReviewThere's an argument to be made that The Last of Us Part I is too similar to the PS3 and PS4 versions to be considered a remake, and part of me agrees with that sentiment. The story is identical, the level design is exactly the same, and the gameplay--apart from some quality-of-life improvements--is unchanged. On paper, if you've played The Last of Us and remember it well, there's little reason to return to it on PS5.But The Last of Us Part I is more than the sum of its parts. It's an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years ago.The most obvious way The Last of Us Part I does this is with its visuals. The overhauled lighting, sharp new textures, and smoother animations make The Last of Us a prettier game, but it's the details in the faces and characters that make it a more meaningful one. I can feel the repressed pain in Joel, sense the pervasive hope in Marlene, and glimpse fleeting moments of innocence in Ellie.These details may not alter the way you think about these characters, but they certainly add more depth to them. Admittedly, these are also details that I've internalized through my multiple playthroughs, years of thinking about the game, and hours of consuming analysis of it. But the intricacies in the way characters are now depicted mean that, for newcomers in particular, the nuances are more immediately perceptible. The writing and acting remain as strong as ever, and although none of the changes recontextualize characters or events, delicate retouches give them greater gravitas.What does recontextualize the characters is the existence of The Last of Us Part II. Joel's actions are harder to stomach knowing their eventual consequences, and Ellie's bloody quest for revenge in the sequel makes her character arc in Part I all the more tragic. Even if you didn't like the direction the narrative took in Part II, it makes the final moments of The Last of Us Part I tougher to swallow.What's more interesting is that, despite knowing how things would eventually shake out, I rarely questioned Joel's motives throughout the game, even in those final moments. It's a testament to Naughty Dog's superb storytelling and fantastic characters that--despite knowing full well what Joel's actions entailed--I wanted to protect Ellie at all costs. All those complicated feelings The Last of Us left me with nine years ago came back stronger when I wrapped up Part I.The gameplay improvements, although subtle, are also done in service of the story. Aiming is more responsive, weapons have a satisfying heft to them, and Joel is a bit easier to maneuver. He's not as nimble as Ellie is in Part II, but a lot of the rough edges in the original have been smoothed out. This kind of stuff is to be expected in remaster or remake, but in the case of The Last of Us Part I, it removes another barrier from the experience. The tweaks to the combat and gameplay give Joel a more cohesive characterization on screen. It may seem like reading a bit too much into it but think of the times you've clumsily missed your gunshots because of the way the aiming works and how that undermined a character we're told has been fighting to survive in a hellish post-apocalypse for 20 years--he shouldn't be whiffing shots in matters of life and death. With the tweaks, The Last of Us Part I's Joel feels more like a cold and calculated combatant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1221bb4-8131-44a4-ba1d-ae39f4a22576": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1221bb4-8131-44a4-ba1d-ae39f4a22576", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e6873e8-4e91-4535-9ca5-48160c386c15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8034b50a91e899abe2e132f32237ccdbfd0de8d160c83e56a0a8dd02974e4694"}, "3": {"node_id": "16d59641-4a54-43df-8590-85820e171b63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ab2e52d93d63625e2e5debace65bea0b987baf5a2f0b86d2aa08b0b8d4ef738"}}, "hash": "5e1cafdaa16ed6c275d83658e201d19f83049588c85a9c1082d4f4604e1dc436", "text": "He is as ruthless as you'd expect from someone in his position and with his tragic history.The improved AI, meanwhile, brings with it a greater sense of peril, especially on the tougher difficulties. Enemies are more aggressive and employ advanced tactics. Some will pressure you from afar while others will flank you if you aren't paying attention. Every now and then an enemy will wait for you to approach and go for an ambush. The unpredictable AI makes for some harrowing firefights. Success demands a mixture of forethought, improvisation, and skill.What really makes the AI so effective is its tenacity. Enemies will fight tooth and nail to survive. If you take an enemy hostage, they will try to bargain with you. Others in the vicinity will try to talk you down before taking action. If you hold a hostage for too long, they will struggle free and return fire. The enemies you come across don't just feel like an obstacle you have to overcome. They feel like people desperately trying to survive in a world that has been torn apart.It helps that companion AI is much better, too. In the original, Ellie, Tess, and Bill would frequently end up in places they shouldn't have been. They couldn't alert enemies, but it was always jarring to see Ellie run in front of an infected while looking for cover. Occasionally in Part I, a companion did get in my way in some tighter areas, but I haven't seen anyone carelessly wander into the fray in this new version. It's a small fix but, once again, it makes this world feel more authentic.Where The Last of Us Part I shows its age is in its level design. Just like the original nine years ago, the game often relies on pallets, dumpsters, and ladders for its traversal puzzles. The Last of Us Part I takes place over the course of a year, and Joel never takes the time to teach Ellie to swim. This means that every time you encounter deep water you need to find a conveniently placed pallet to ferry her across a small body of water. It was hard to overlook back then, but it's even harder to overlook now. Naughty Dog has gone through great pains to immerse the player in the world, and these simple puzzles don't fit the tone of the game. They are rote video game moments in an experience that doesn\u2019t need them.The Last of Us Part I is an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years agoThe combat arenas also feel a bit too enclosed and straightforward. There are some standouts, like the docks at the beginning of the game or the bookstore in Philadelphia, but most of the encounters take place in linear corridors with waist-high objects used as cover. This lack of freedom limits your options in combat and makes it difficult to improvise when your back is up against a wall. It's a shame because Joel's arsenal is varied, and his craftable items can be fun to use.It's even harder to overlook given how impressive Part II's level design was. The reason why combat felt so dynamic in Part II was because there was always room to improvise and multiple avenues of approach to support this. This is unmistakably one of those moments where the limited scope of this \"remake\" undermines the idea of creating harmony between the first and second parts of The Last of Us' overall story. While the narrative and characterization certainly feel more cohesive now, the same can't be said for how it feels to play the two games.The biggest example of this is Joel's inability to go prone. It may have seemed like a minor mechanic in The Last of Us Part II, but it fundamentally changed the way I approached combat. Obviously, Part I was not designed with a crawling Joel in mind. There is no grass to hide in, and cover is almost always waist-high, but the inability to go prone does create more of a dissonance between Part I and Part II.However, fixating on gameplay discrepancies between both games diminishes The Last of Us Part I's achievements. The brilliantly-paced narrative is supported by some of the finest environmental storytelling in the business. So much of the world and its inhabitants can be extracted from the smallest details. A throwaway line between two hostile enemy NPCs can shed light on other parts of the world, while a simple message scrawled across a wall hints at how the outbreak was handled two decades ago. The environments are rich with details that add flavor to Joel and Ellie's journey.The most welcome addition to The Last of Us Part I is its impressive suite of accessibility features.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16d59641-4a54-43df-8590-85820e171b63": {"__data__": {"id_": "16d59641-4a54-43df-8590-85820e171b63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1221bb4-8131-44a4-ba1d-ae39f4a22576", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5e1cafdaa16ed6c275d83658e201d19f83049588c85a9c1082d4f4604e1dc436"}, "3": {"node_id": "a9b64744-b295-42c7-8e36-4298b05f8f5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc527313c140b5bbe94ca295f5e119d24992364543df77e30870378a865ec7d0"}}, "hash": "0ab2e52d93d63625e2e5debace65bea0b987baf5a2f0b86d2aa08b0b8d4ef738", "text": "Like The Last of Us Part II, there are a wide range of visual, auditory, and difficulty settings that significantly lower the bar to entry and make the experience more accommodating. You can customize subtitles, tweak screenshake, enable different vision modes, and retool the controls at any time to fit your needs. Even if you don't think you need any of these features, you might find something in there to make your experience a little smoother. I frequently played with high-contrast mode enabled to help me track down smaller collectibles that I wouldn't normally be able to see, but for others, these newly added options might make what was previously an unplayable game into a playable one.Additionally, The Last of Us Part I adds a ton of new unlockables in the Extras menu. Like in previous Naughty Dog games, as you play through the story you accrue points that can be used to unlock all sorts of things. There's concept art from both the original and remake, new and returning character skins, gameplay modifiers like infinite ammo and explosive arrows, and a handful of behind-the-scenes videos and podcasts. While none of this fundamentally changes the experience, I spent hours digging through this menu to admire all the intricately designed character models and test out the new gameplay modifiers. These bells and whistles do a good job of rounding out the package.The most painful omission from this remake is Factions, the stellar PvP mode from the original game. The multiplayer mode had players choose a faction and build out a camp of survivors by running Supply Raids, which were matches that pitted you against the rival faction. Success would earn you resources to keep your compound afloat. Naughty Dog is working on an expanded standalone multiplayer component set in the world of The Last of Us and its sequel, but it's a shame the original Factions mode didn't make the cut.Those looking for a little longevity from the game can instead try the speedrun and permadeath modes. The permadeath mode in particular fits nicely with the themes of The Last of Us. It's not for the faint of heart, even on easier difficulties, but it significantly ups the stakes. Every encounter must be tackled with precision, and a wasted bullet could lead to an untimely death. The speedrun mode on the other hand feels at odds with what The Last of Us accomplishes with its story. The thoughtful pace and quiet moments are undone by a timer and a scoring system. It's not necessarily a bad inclusion, and it's available as an option, but it's definitely not the way I'd like to experience The Last of Us Part I.All these improvements taken by themselves may seem minor, but together they make one of the most memorable games of the PS3 era even better. In some ways, the two parts of The Last of Us are now better aligned, making transitioning between them much smoother. However, in other ways, the years of progress in game design and development are all too apparent. But while some of the level design may not have aged all that well, the vivid cast of characters and remarkable story are more poignant than ever. Hot off the heels of the successful The Last of Us on HBO, the long-awaited port of the first game in Naughty Dog's acclaimed series has arrived on PC with disappointing results. Those who have waited over a decade since the game's original release on PS3, or anyone looking to replay the first chapter in Joel and Ellie's tale again on PC, will be let down by the game's overall performance, which manages to shine only on the most expensive and least used hardware on the market today.There are two fundamental issues that plague The Last of Us Part I on PC. First is VRAM (video memory found on your GPU) usage, and more specifically how much the game demands. Running at 1440p with Ultra settings, the game's expansive settings menu informed me that the 12GB of VRAM on my RTX 3080 Ti would not be enough, suggesting I drop settings like texture quality and filtering down to compensate. Ignoring the advice led to some consistent stuttering during gameplay, which, for a change, isn't down to shader compilation stutter. After first opening the game, you're subjected to a 45-minute-long shader compilation (which you'll have to do again after a graphics driver update or reinstallation), negatively impacting performance if you decide to play while this happens. But once that's complete, it meant that any stutters I did encounter were exclusively due to settings pushing past the recommended VRAM limits.That means, for a relatively powerful GPU like the RTX 3080 Ti, Ultra settings even at 1440p were off the table, which doesn't bode well for cards lower down the chain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9b64744-b295-42c7-8e36-4298b05f8f5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9b64744-b295-42c7-8e36-4298b05f8f5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "16d59641-4a54-43df-8590-85820e171b63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ab2e52d93d63625e2e5debace65bea0b987baf5a2f0b86d2aa08b0b8d4ef738"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff439062-68a8-49cc-87c5-9439aad2257e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "78e7f485cbb9a65beb0da7e1134d143c67aad1ebdda87efabf1925d39f6f7cea"}}, "hash": "bc527313c140b5bbe94ca295f5e119d24992364543df77e30870378a865ec7d0", "text": "The RTX 3070, a popular choice amongst PC gamers, only comes with 8GB of VRAM, which prevents you from playing The Last of Us Part I with anything higher than Medium texture settings, irrespective of resolution. I verified this using an RTX 3050 with 8 GB of VRAM, which doesn't perform equally to the RTX 3070 but has the exact same memory limitations. What's problematic about that is just how drastically different the game looks at these settings, with texture resolution and clarity taking a significant hit between High and Medium presets. It's so degraded that it's at a point where you're playing a far less visually impressive game when compared to its PlayStation 5 version, despite having more capable hardware.The second issue is CPU performance. The Last of Us Part I makes surprisingly great use of all the cores of your CPU, which isn't the norm in a sea of titles that are still so reliant on powerful single cores. What is baffling, and detrimental to performance, is just how much the game is using your CPU all the time, and how hard it is frequently each core in the least demanding scenarios. Near the opening hour of the game, I was standing in an empty alleyway with only two other NPCs in sight and zero interactions taking place. At this moment, The Last of Us Part I was hammering all 12 threads of my AMD Ryzen 5600X, with each one reporting over 80% usage. While moving around and engaging in combat, each thread was routinely hovering around 90-95% usage, touching 100% from time to time and limiting my overall frame rate as a result. Marvel's Spider-Man on PC is another CPU-heavy game, but in that situation it makes more sense, as you're moving fast through a large open world with loads more happening as you zip past traffic and pedestrians. And even then, I never saw CPU usage at half of what The Last of Us Part I was demanding during my time with Spider-Man. The Last of Us Part I's CPU usage is currently out of control, and you'll probably find yourself CPU-limited in numerous scenarios even if you have the latest GPU to push past its other issues.It's a shame that playing The Last of Us Part I right now on anything but a GPU with at least (and preferably more than) 12GB of VRAM is a severely limited experience--especially when compared to its stellar performance on Sony's own hardware--because this remake routinely establishes itself as one of the most visually captivating ports of a Sony title yet on PC. It's difficult to reconcile that this was once a game on two-generations-old console hardware, but if you have the graphical horsepower to show it off at its best, it's a marvel of gorgeous lighting, highly-detailed environments, and stunnings character modeling that is accentuated with additional PC settings that show the game off in a new, stunning light.The settings menu itself is extensive, with helpful previews that show how your changes are affecting the image and useful descriptions informing you of what parts of your PC you're helping by turning things down. The VRAM usage meter is helpful in reigning in settings that would otherwise cause irritating stutter, but it's also the facet of this menu that's most confusing. It features a section that suggests a portion of your VRAM is being locked up by other applications and your operating system, but the figure it reports doesn't correlate to actual usage. Even more confusing is that this figure scales according to how much VRAM you have in total, with 2.4GB being used on my 12GB RTX 3080 Ti and 1.5GB on my RTX 3050. There is no real way to bring it down, either, which may (or may not) be affecting overall VRAM usage by the game itself.This is something that should hopefully be addressed by future patches, along with a host of other performance improvements and optimizations to bring this port to a level of quality we've come to expect from Naughty Dog. It's disappointing after the relatively good work done on the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection that The Last of Us Part I seems a long way away from being a smooth experience for most players. So if you've been waiting all these years to finally experience Joel and Ellie's story for the first time, it's probably best if you wait at least a little longer.

It took me a while to notice, but once I did, it was hard to unsee. There's a pain in his eyes. His clothes and features are the same, but there's a quiet, unmistakable torment imprinted on his face. I've played The Last of Us nearly a dozen times across PS3 and PS4, and I had never seen it worn so plainly. I know Joel has a troubled past because The Last of Us Part I goes out of its way to show you a traumatic death in the opening scene, but that pain was never etched into his facial features this clearly.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: The Last of Us Part I Video ReviewThere's an argument to be made that The Last of Us Part I is too similar to the PS3 and PS4 versions to be considered a remake, and part of me agrees with that sentiment. The story is identical, the level design is exactly the same, and the gameplay--apart from some quality-of-life improvements--is unchanged. On paper, if you've played The Last of Us and remember it well, there's little reason to return to it on PS5.But The Last of Us Part I is more than the sum of its parts. It's an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years ago.The most obvious way The Last of Us Part I does this is with its visuals. The overhauled lighting, sharp new textures, and smoother animations make The Last of Us a prettier game, but it's the details in the faces and characters that make it a more meaningful one. I can feel the repressed pain in Joel, sense the pervasive hope in Marlene, and glimpse fleeting moments of innocence in Ellie.These details may not alter the way you think about these characters, but they certainly add more depth to them. Admittedly, these are also details that I've internalized through my multiple playthroughs, years of thinking about the game, and hours of consuming analysis of it. But the intricacies in the way characters are now depicted mean that, for newcomers in particular, the nuances are more immediately perceptible. The writing and acting remain as strong as ever, and although none of the changes recontextualize characters or events, delicate retouches give them greater gravitas.What does recontextualize the characters is the existence of The Last of Us Part II. Joel's actions are harder to stomach knowing their eventual consequences, and Ellie's bloody quest for revenge in the sequel makes her character arc in Part I all the more tragic. Even if you didn't like the direction the narrative took in Part II, it makes the final moments of The Last of Us Part I tougher to swallow.What's more interesting is that, despite knowing how things would eventually shake out, I rarely questioned Joel's motives throughout the game, even in those final moments. It's a testament to Naughty Dog's superb storytelling and fantastic characters that--despite knowing full well what Joel's actions entailed--I wanted to protect Ellie at all costs. All those complicated feelings The Last of Us left me with nine years ago came back stronger when I wrapped up Part I.The gameplay improvements, although subtle, are also done in service of the story. Aiming is more responsive, weapons have a satisfying heft to them, and Joel is a bit easier to maneuver. He's not as nimble as Ellie is in Part II, but a lot of the rough edges in the original have been smoothed out. This kind of stuff is to be expected in remaster or remake, but in the case of The Last of Us Part I, it removes another barrier from the experience. The tweaks to the combat and gameplay give Joel a more cohesive characterization on screen.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d156103-1db6-42d6-8659-ef45027dd434": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d156103-1db6-42d6-8659-ef45027dd434", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff439062-68a8-49cc-87c5-9439aad2257e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "78e7f485cbb9a65beb0da7e1134d143c67aad1ebdda87efabf1925d39f6f7cea"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e63f0c9-2b85-4943-a550-a127f7d293f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a484def9de87c1ad4c0f1648190e2ffd8bf6d7bf0b200fef59858d9aae6b560"}}, "hash": "ea5c24072e4a3fd29e75ab49cba688cf555635a916dd6972d9dbdcda6d6044ff", "text": "The tweaks to the combat and gameplay give Joel a more cohesive characterization on screen. It may seem like reading a bit too much into it but think of the times you've clumsily missed your gunshots because of the way the aiming works and how that undermined a character we're told has been fighting to survive in a hellish post-apocalypse for 20 years--he shouldn't be whiffing shots in matters of life and death. With the tweaks, The Last of Us Part I's Joel feels more like a cold and calculated combatant. He is as ruthless as you'd expect from someone in his position and with his tragic history.The improved AI, meanwhile, brings with it a greater sense of peril, especially on the tougher difficulties. Enemies are more aggressive and employ advanced tactics. Some will pressure you from afar while others will flank you if you aren't paying attention. Every now and then an enemy will wait for you to approach and go for an ambush. The unpredictable AI makes for some harrowing firefights. Success demands a mixture of forethought, improvisation, and skill.What really makes the AI so effective is its tenacity. Enemies will fight tooth and nail to survive. If you take an enemy hostage, they will try to bargain with you. Others in the vicinity will try to talk you down before taking action. If you hold a hostage for too long, they will struggle free and return fire. The enemies you come across don't just feel like an obstacle you have to overcome. They feel like people desperately trying to survive in a world that has been torn apart.It helps that companion AI is much better, too. In the original, Ellie, Tess, and Bill would frequently end up in places they shouldn't have been. They couldn't alert enemies, but it was always jarring to see Ellie run in front of an infected while looking for cover. Occasionally in Part I, a companion did get in my way in some tighter areas, but I haven't seen anyone carelessly wander into the fray in this new version. It's a small fix but, once again, it makes this world feel more authentic.Where The Last of Us Part I shows its age is in its level design. Just like the original nine years ago, the game often relies on pallets, dumpsters, and ladders for its traversal puzzles. The Last of Us Part I takes place over the course of a year, and Joel never takes the time to teach Ellie to swim. This means that every time you encounter deep water you need to find a conveniently placed pallet to ferry her across a small body of water. It was hard to overlook back then, but it's even harder to overlook now. Naughty Dog has gone through great pains to immerse the player in the world, and these simple puzzles don't fit the tone of the game. They are rote video game moments in an experience that doesn\u2019t need them.The Last of Us Part I is an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years agoThe combat arenas also feel a bit too enclosed and straightforward. There are some standouts, like the docks at the beginning of the game or the bookstore in Philadelphia, but most of the encounters take place in linear corridors with waist-high objects used as cover. This lack of freedom limits your options in combat and makes it difficult to improvise when your back is up against a wall. It's a shame because Joel's arsenal is varied, and his craftable items can be fun to use.It's even harder to overlook given how impressive Part II's level design was. The reason why combat felt so dynamic in Part II was because there was always room to improvise and multiple avenues of approach to support this. This is unmistakably one of those moments where the limited scope of this \"remake\" undermines the idea of creating harmony between the first and second parts of The Last of Us' overall story. While the narrative and characterization certainly feel more cohesive now, the same can't be said for how it feels to play the two games.The biggest example of this is Joel's inability to go prone. It may have seemed like a minor mechanic in The Last of Us Part II, but it fundamentally changed the way I approached combat. Obviously, Part I was not designed with a crawling Joel in mind. There is no grass to hide in, and cover is almost always waist-high, but the inability to go prone does create more of a dissonance between Part I and Part II.However, fixating on gameplay discrepancies between both games diminishes The Last of Us Part I's achievements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e63f0c9-2b85-4943-a550-a127f7d293f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e63f0c9-2b85-4943-a550-a127f7d293f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d156103-1db6-42d6-8659-ef45027dd434", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea5c24072e4a3fd29e75ab49cba688cf555635a916dd6972d9dbdcda6d6044ff"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4099020-592a-46e4-9019-2739e6656aef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b2353dbe31cd65a24f4916f4f931428bcfa0c4d766099655930121c6117b36f"}}, "hash": "2a484def9de87c1ad4c0f1648190e2ffd8bf6d7bf0b200fef59858d9aae6b560", "text": "The brilliantly-paced narrative is supported by some of the finest environmental storytelling in the business. So much of the world and its inhabitants can be extracted from the smallest details. A throwaway line between two hostile enemy NPCs can shed light on other parts of the world, while a simple message scrawled across a wall hints at how the outbreak was handled two decades ago. The environments are rich with details that add flavor to Joel and Ellie's journey.The most welcome addition to The Last of Us Part I is its impressive suite of accessibility features. Like The Last of Us Part II, there are a wide range of visual, auditory, and difficulty settings that significantly lower the bar to entry and make the experience more accommodating. You can customize subtitles, tweak screenshake, enable different vision modes, and retool the controls at any time to fit your needs. Even if you don't think you need any of these features, you might find something in there to make your experience a little smoother. I frequently played with high-contrast mode enabled to help me track down smaller collectibles that I wouldn't normally be able to see, but for others, these newly added options might make what was previously an unplayable game into a playable one.Additionally, The Last of Us Part I adds a ton of new unlockables in the Extras menu. Like in previous Naughty Dog games, as you play through the story you accrue points that can be used to unlock all sorts of things. There's concept art from both the original and remake, new and returning character skins, gameplay modifiers like infinite ammo and explosive arrows, and a handful of behind-the-scenes videos and podcasts. While none of this fundamentally changes the experience, I spent hours digging through this menu to admire all the intricately designed character models and test out the new gameplay modifiers. These bells and whistles do a good job of rounding out the package.The most painful omission from this remake is Factions, the stellar PvP mode from the original game. The multiplayer mode had players choose a faction and build out a camp of survivors by running Supply Raids, which were matches that pitted you against the rival faction. Success would earn you resources to keep your compound afloat. Naughty Dog is working on an expanded standalone multiplayer component set in the world of The Last of Us and its sequel, but it's a shame the original Factions mode didn't make the cut.Those looking for a little longevity from the game can instead try the speedrun and permadeath modes. The permadeath mode in particular fits nicely with the themes of The Last of Us. It's not for the faint of heart, even on easier difficulties, but it significantly ups the stakes. Every encounter must be tackled with precision, and a wasted bullet could lead to an untimely death. The speedrun mode on the other hand feels at odds with what The Last of Us accomplishes with its story. The thoughtful pace and quiet moments are undone by a timer and a scoring system. It's not necessarily a bad inclusion, and it's available as an option, but it's definitely not the way I'd like to experience The Last of Us Part I.All these improvements taken by themselves may seem minor, but together they make one of the most memorable games of the PS3 era even better. In some ways, the two parts of The Last of Us are now better aligned, making transitioning between them much smoother. However, in other ways, the years of progress in game design and development are all too apparent. But while some of the level design may not have aged all that well, the vivid cast of characters and remarkable story are more poignant than ever.

The RTX 3070, a popular choice amongst PC gamers, only comes with 8GB of VRAM, which prevents you from playing The Last of Us Part I with anything higher than Medium texture settings, irrespective of resolution.

And even then, I never saw CPU usage at half of what The Last of Us Part I was demanding during my time with Spider-Man. The Last of Us Part I's CPU usage is currently out of control, and you'll probably find yourself CPU-limited in numerous scenarios even if you have the latest GPU to push past its other issues.It's a shame that playing The Last of Us Part I right now on anything but a GPU with at least (and preferably more than) 12GB of VRAM is a severely limited experience--especially when compared to its stellar performance on Sony's own hardware--because this remake routinely establishes itself as one of the most visually captivating ports of a Sony title yet on PC. It's difficult to reconcile that this was once a game on two-generations-old console hardware, but if you have the graphical horsepower to show it off at its best, it's a marvel of gorgeous lighting, highly-detailed environments, and stunnings character modeling that is accentuated with additional PC settings that show the game off in a new, stunning light.The settings menu itself is extensive, with helpful previews that show how your changes are affecting the image and useful descriptions informing you of what parts of your PC you're helping by turning things down. The VRAM usage meter is helpful in reigning in settings that would otherwise cause irritating stutter, but it's also the facet of this menu that's most confusing. It features a section that suggests a portion of your VRAM is being locked up by other applications and your operating system, but the figure it reports doesn't correlate to actual usage. Even more confusing is that this figure scales according to how much VRAM you have in total, with 2.4GB being used on my 12GB RTX 3080 Ti and 1.5GB on my RTX 3050. There is no real way to bring it down, either, which may (or may not) be affecting overall VRAM usage by the game itself.This is something that should hopefully be addressed by future patches, along with a host of other performance improvements and optimizations to bring this port to a level of quality we've come to expect from Naughty Dog. It's disappointing after the relatively good work done on the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection that The Last of Us Part I seems a long way away from being a smooth experience for most players. So if you've been waiting all these years to finally experience Joel and Ellie's story for the first time, it's probably best if you wait at least a little longer.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d5fef6d-b2df-4508-bd74-84df07ba7001": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d5fef6d-b2df-4508-bd74-84df07ba7001", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4099020-592a-46e4-9019-2739e6656aef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2b2353dbe31cd65a24f4916f4f931428bcfa0c4d766099655930121c6117b36f"}, "3": {"node_id": "f0032062-686b-46e5-b16b-2900b33f42e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d11e9ef1ac9e402e2b144517d178b32c3c115cd1dad7f84d70bd27774d4d51f8"}}, "hash": "366c07fc8e5f0d20b14a936503d1528520337b6d2fc9e22fa17cac125c37ef42", "text": "Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:OK, I get why people liked this gameI\u2019ve managed to go nearly 10 years without encountering The Last of Us spoilers. How did this happen? For one, I wasn\u2019t covering the video game industry in 2013 \u2014 I worked early mornings kneading bread and creaming butter for cookies in a bakery, then fiddling with keys to get into strangers\u2019 houses to walk their dogs. I played console video games on an aging Xbox 360 and StarCraft 2 on my Mac laptop. I hadn\u2019t had a PlayStation console since the PlayStation 2, which had long been retired to my parents\u2019 garage, and wouldn\u2019t have one of my own until the PlayStation 5 \u2014 save for a brief period where I borrowed a PlayStation 4 from a friend to play Death Stranding.Polygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games, movies, TV shows, comics, tabletop books, and entertainment experiences.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch.This is all to say that I had no physical way to play The Last of Us, and, against all odds, I somehow avoided spoilers, too. And now, I have a PlayStation 5 taking up way too much space in my living room, and I can finally say that I\u2019ve played The Last of Us. And yeah, it\u2019s still a fucking good game.It feels trite to summarize The Last of Us Part 1, given its significance and ubiquity, but I\u2019ll do it for the sake of anyone else who doesn\u2019t know the setup by now: The Last of Us is set in a postapocalyptic world where humans have been infected by the Cordyceps fungus \u2014 a parasitic fungi that infects the brain and turns infected humans into violent, mutated monsters. The main plot begins 20 years following the initial outbreak, where humans have moved into decaying, militarized quarantine zones and remote, dangerous settlements. Joel and Ellie are two of the survivors; Joel survived the initial outbreak, although his daughter did not. Ellie, on the other hand, was born into this world. Their relationship is initially hostile, at best, as Joel is tasked with smuggling the teenager out of Boston and into the hands of the Fireflies, a revolutionary group that wants to use the immune Ellie to find a cure for the infection.The Last of Us\u2019 world is as dangerous and violent as any other zombie epic, and its characters are just as ruthless and brutal. But The Last of Us is constantly reminding its players that the brutality of the world is a holdover from pre-infection society. Sure, lots of games centered on violence before The Last of Us, and many continue to do the same. But despite the sheer number of postapocalyptic games, movies, and books that have emerged in The Last of Us\u2019 wake, Naughty Dog\u2019s still feels inspired \u2014 almost fresh \u2014 in 2022. This may be a result of zombie fiction falling out of fashion in the last few years, or the fact that linear, big-budget action-adventure games are few and far between. Either way, the timing for this re-release just feels right.\n    Related\n  Still, in 2022, the violence in The Last of Us still feels upsetting. Folks have said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: The Last of Us isn\u2019t exactly fun to play. It\u2019s no Halo Infinite or Fortnite, wherein shooting and killing is just a series of numbers ticking up on a scoreboard. Holding Joel\u2019s gun, aiming that gun, and shooting that gun is miserable, unbearable, and painful \u2014 not only because Joel is fending off other surviving humans, but because the resources are so scarce: Am I going to regret using that bullet?For all its moments of cynicism and regret for a lost world, The Last of Us is also a very tender game. It navigates Joel and Ellie\u2019s relationship through shifts both subtle and tectonic as they travel across the broken U.S. Their dynamic begins antagonistically \u2014 Ellie\u2019s a burden to Joel, the baggage of a promise he made to a now-dead partner. And to Ellie, Joel\u2019s just another stranger who will abandon her at some point along the way. But each westward American city presents a new catalyst for that relationship.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0032062-686b-46e5-b16b-2900b33f42e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0032062-686b-46e5-b16b-2900b33f42e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d5fef6d-b2df-4508-bd74-84df07ba7001", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "366c07fc8e5f0d20b14a936503d1528520337b6d2fc9e22fa17cac125c37ef42"}, "3": {"node_id": "f3ed3945-5bc1-4a7c-aaa7-294cb8053262", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9678548dd15710820234e5028af4710a55badd21a0eb0dce5972ca12e3ceca3a"}}, "hash": "d11e9ef1ac9e402e2b144517d178b32c3c115cd1dad7f84d70bd27774d4d51f8", "text": "But each westward American city presents a new catalyst for that relationship. From Boston to Pittsburgh, through Jackson and Salt Lake City, Naughty Dog\u2019s choice to pace the game alongside the seasons works wonders: from the summer in Boston, where you can almost feel the heat radiating off its decaying buildings, to winter in Silver Lake, Colorado, where blood stands out on the bright, white snow. Though the game is relatively short \u2014 or at least, devoid of bloat, by modern standards \u2014 the movement of the seasons makes time feel tangible. And with that time, Joel and Ellie\u2019s relationship begins to grow.Little by little, they settle into a fraught father-daughter bond. There are serenely touching moments interspersed between the brutality of it all, the most affecting of which is when Joel and Ellie reach Utah and find a stray pack of giraffes that escaped and are thriving outside some abandoned zoo. It\u2019s a scene that\u2019s become pervasive, almost a meme \u2014 that thing everyone talks about when they\u2019re discussing The Last of Us. And that\u2019s for good reason; the moment still floored me, nine years later.\n    Related\n  The moment comes so suddenly, surrounded as it was by misery. Ellie, hoisted onto a ledge by Joel, drops the ladder she was tasked with handling \u2014 she sees something that Joel can\u2019t see. I expected horror, something more grotesque than even the most bloated bloater. But then her voice changed, and I realized it wasn\u2019t anything bad. It was beautiful. Naughty Dog smartly lets the player linger on the overlook, the giraffes nipping leaves from trees and wandering around a flooded patch of city \u2014 now something more like a lake. I stayed there a while to relish in Ellie\u2019s delight, and the beauty of the picture, and it felt cruel, in retrospect, to open the door into The Last of Us\u2019 next, bleak phase.In a way, I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve only just now seen The Last of Us through to its conclusion. I can see it outside the trope of violent, sad dads that dominated the milieu when it was released \u2014 think BioShock Infinite, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and Grand Theft Auto 5, too. The Last of Us is very much a product of its time, and there\u2019s certainly issues there. But now that I\u2019ve seen how well it\u2019s aged overall, I can really appreciate it \u2014 not as a cultural relic or a stepping stone, but as its own grisly, beautiful creation.

GameRevolution gave both of them a 10 out of 10 upon release, and with good reason\u00a0\u2014 logic would dictate that a remake would also get a perfect score.There\u2019s been a lot of debate about whether The Last of Us Part 1 is really worth its asking price. After all, Sony is charging full price for a remake of a game that\u2019s been available for $19.99 (or free) for almost a decade that has already received a successful remaster. The big question is whether or not the updated content made enough of an impact to justify the $50 price difference\u00a0\u2014So, let\u2019s get this out of the way right at the beginning: pricing is this game\u2019s primary flaw. If it\u2019d been released at a lower MSRP, or if it had included The Last of Us 2, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a great way to experience the game that started it all.But this isn\u2019t a simple cash grab. You can tell developer Naughty Dog put a ton of effort into refining the gameplay and improving the graphics.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3ed3945-5bc1-4a7c-aaa7-294cb8053262": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3ed3945-5bc1-4a7c-aaa7-294cb8053262", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0032062-686b-46e5-b16b-2900b33f42e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d11e9ef1ac9e402e2b144517d178b32c3c115cd1dad7f84d70bd27774d4d51f8"}, "3": {"node_id": "500a8608-9c81-4023-8aad-0fe781f25eb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "21d4b2b813d256685e55954cab41707a883aef190690bae41e5a54f06158d9b0"}}, "hash": "9678548dd15710820234e5028af4710a55badd21a0eb0dce5972ca12e3ceca3a", "text": "However, it doesn\u2019t feel like there was a holistic approach to remaking The Last of Us. Instead, it seems different game segments were walled off and improved independently of the others.I always use Resident Evil 2 (2019) as an example of a remake done right. Capcom looked at every facet of the original and looked at how it could expand that story with modern tools. What we got was faithful to the original but wasn\u2019t afraid to do its own thing.In contrast, The Last of Us Part 1 seems stuck somewhere between remaster and remake; it comes so soon after the release of the 2014 PS4 remaster that a vast improvement isn\u2019t possible. So, while things like DualSense compatibility and improved graphics are welcome, not enough time has passed for it to have that \u201cwow\u201d factor we see with other remakes.Storywise, The Last of Us Part 1 is a 1:1 remake of the original. I didn\u2019t play the two side-by-side, but I\u2019m familiar enough with the source material to notice any noteworthy additions or changes to the narrative. You have access to both the base story and its DLC Left Behind, and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find something as minor as an adjusted camera angle in a cutscene.While I\u2019m happy the story remains intact, there were some huge missed opportunities here. For example, it would have been nice to see the beginning expanded to show us more of the Boston quarantine zone and Joel\u2019s smuggling career with Tess.Alternatively, there are some considerable gaps in Joel and Ellie\u2019s trip west that Naughty Dog could have expanded upon. Are we supposed to believe that nothing happened to them in the 1,800 miles between Pittsburgh, PA, and Jackson, WY, after the eventful trip through the northeast?A remake is an excellent time for developers to go back and add or tweak aspects of the story they didn\u2019t have the time, resources, or tech to do the first time. It\u2019d be one thing if this were a $30-40 title, but the lack of new content makes $70 a big ask. With all that said, the story hasn\u2019t aged a bit. It\u2019s still a fantastic journey, and I enjoyed every minute of it.On the flip side, everything but the story has been overhauled for The Last of Us Part 1. Pretty much every system has been brought up to the level of The Last of Us Part 2. Combat, animations, graphics, visual effects, and sound are all improved over the original.There are no longer any scripted fights with human enemies. Instead, when you\u2019re forced to face off against a group of them, the AI will use tactics like pairing up to attack or flanking you, which makes things a lot tougher than they were in the original.Your partners\u2019 AI is also improved. There are fewer instances of them awkwardly popping out from cover in front of an enemy only to go unnoticed. Of course, it still happens sometimes, but it\u2019s not nearly as immersion-breaking as it was in the original.The updated animation system is also excellent;\u00a0 players and NPCs now move through the environment more realistically. For example, they\u2019ll automatically put their hand against a wall if sneaking near one, and they\u2019ll sway their bodies to actively avoid obstacles. All this adds up to make for a more believable environment.But while the action may have had some notable additions, there\u2019s one glaring omission from this package \u2014 the original\u2019s Factions multiplayer. Naughty Dog is still working on a standalone version of Factions, so it\u2019s likely that Naughty Dog saw reason to remake the original. However, this brings us back to the price \u2014 despite all the gameplay improvements, you\u2019re paying $70 to get less content than was available in The Last of Us Remastered when it launched at $50.Sure, a smattering of new extras is included with The Last of Us Part 1, like a model viewer and extra outfits. However, they don\u2019t come close to making up for the loss of Factions, and while it\u2019s understandable that Naughty Dog wouldn\u2019t want to encroach on the standalone version, it makes this a less attractive purchase.The Last of Us Part 1 is the definitive way to experience the original story and Left Behind. However, it\u2019s hard to recommend it over the PS4 remaster.

The gist of this anger is due to the original game on PS3 releasing a little over nine years ago. So, how dare Naughty Dog remake a game that new, right?Frankly, I don\u2019t care what projects a game development studio decides to take on, and in this particular instance the handwringing over an extensively spruced up remake feels rather performative. My take: this is a superb remake of an already brilliant game that brings it up to the standard people expect from a modern Naughty Dog game. It\u2019s easily one of the best remakes I\u2019ve ever played. If you are coming to The Last of Us for the first time, what you\u2019ve got is essentially a zombie apocalypse scenario, but we don\u2019t call them zombies \u2013 they're the infected and they come in variety of horrific forms, such as Runners, Stalkers, and Clickers (the latter gives me shivers just reading the name). Joel, a bearded, gruff man, suffers a terrible loss when things take a dramatic turn, only for him to find Ellie, a teenage girl, in his care as they venture into  hostile lands on a delivery mission.Naughty Dog is great at creating believable characters, and The Last of Us delivers a number of standouts, all of which you\u2019ll spend a decent chunk of time with to make them feel core to the whole experience. Unlike many games that feature ally NPCs, these don\u2019t feel so much like bots, and crucially they don\u2019t exist to spout inane gibberish. \r\n\r\nThe official line from PlayStation and Naughty Dog about the improvements you get in this remake is thus: \u201cA total overhaul of the original experience, faithfully reproduced but incorporating modernized gameplay mechanics, improved controls and expanded accessibility options. Feel immersed in improved environmental storytelling, effects, facial animations, and enhanced exploration and combat.\u201d Having not played the original in about eight years, I can\u2019t claim to notice every little tweak and change, but as a complete game this remake is everything I wanted. Like most of Naughty Dog\u2019s games, presentation is a key part of what made The Last of Us stand out on PS3. Go back to that game today (or its marginally-improved PS4 port) and yes, it\u2019s still the same excellent game full of top-tier interactive storytelling, but it\u2019s not the showstopper it once was. The passage of time and the onward march of technology is kind to very few video games of the PS3/Xbox 360 era, even those that pushed the limits of what those consoles could produce. \r\nOn PS5, The Last of Us Part 1 looks gorgeous once more, and as a franchise soon to welcome new fans following the HBO TV series, it made perfect sense to bring the video game that started things up to this new high bar. Everything here has been improved, but it\u2019s the lighting that hit me first. You probably remember that the original release excelled in this area, but it\u2019s on another level in the remake. There\u2019s far greater range on display now, meaning scenes have been finely tuned to a degree simply not possible two console generations ago.

Maybe it\u2019s the fact that in the almost-10-years that have followed the original release more and more games have opted for this heavy, rugged feel to combat, but in the remake I didn\u2019t find it bothersome in the slightest. There\u2019s a slight clunkiness to certain mechanics, such as switching weapons, which I\u2019d usually hate, but... at the risk of sounding like the worst PlayStation fan of all time, it works here rather brilliantly. This struggle can combine with the more tense enemy encounters to really amp up the stress levels. Melee combat, while a little simplistic, is meaty and, so my stumbles with unloaded weapons often forced my hand quite literally to use a metal bar or baseball bat. These thunderous blows are just as unpleasant as the world itself and I frequently ended encounters with a sense of relief. It was all over, for now. If only I remembered to make better use of Molotovs and nail bombs \u2013 the former being one of the most grimly pleasing firebombs to grace a video game, producing some truly nightmarish screams from the infected. As for those planks and ladders, well, they aren\u2019t a huge problem. I\u2019m not really sure what the hullabaloo was about back in 2013 to be honest. Aside from the remade original story campaign, Part 1 also includes an equally well modernised version of the Left Behind DLC \u2013 featuring Ellie and her friend Riley, before the events of the main game. There are also a load of speedrunning features I\u2019m never going to use (speed is not my thing) and a load of new accessibility features including multiple visual rendering options, audio description and more. If you fancy yourself a bit of a pro, or just have too much time to burn, a new permadeath mode is also included. I\u2019m staying well clear. Much has been made of the 3D audio, DualSense haptics, and improved AI in Part 1. These are all things that make this feel like a new experience, not just a port. The AI is the hardest to judge as no one plays the game tracking the movement of every enemy and buddy, but encounters play out really well, the dynamics changing rapidly depending on how well you utilise stealth. I played the game with USB headphones and the 3D audio is properly unsettling at points. At certain moments the tension proved to be a little too much, so I switched to playing with the sound muted for the sake of my heart. Someone is bound to chime in to moan about the Factions multiplayer mode not being brought over to PS5. Would it have been great to see it here? Yes. Should it stop you buying and enjoying this remake? No. We know Naughty Dog is working on something new for a Last of Us multiplayer experience, so we\u2019ll just have to wait and see how that turns out.If this wasn\u2019t a remake, I firmly believe it would be right at the top of Game of the Year articles as we assess things over a bit of Christmas Pudding. The PS5 has had some brilliant games already, no doubt, but as a fan of The Last of Us, Part 1 is my new favourite exclusive on the console.

But this wasn't a shooting gallery interrupted by wild train sequences and epic climbs up mountains. Instead, TLOU appeared to host the tensest and most brutal combat ever seen on a gaming console. A camera dramatically swung around two survivors of an apocalypse, and these resource-starved protagonists tiptoed around dangerous foes (humans and zombies alike), always one low-on-ammo gun jam or wrong step away from certain doom.One year later, the game launched to accolades and high sales figures, but it didn't quite resemble that dramatically staged \"real gameplay\" trailer. The final game's\u00a0enemy AI, battle choreography, and presentation of player choices felt more video gamey than we saw in the trailer.I remembered that old sense of disappointment while I played The Last Of Us Pt. 1, this week's PS5 remake of the 2013 original. Honestly, there were moments while I tested this note-for-note remake where I felt adrift, enough so that I saw cracks in its handsome, \"current-gen\" facade. This is not a perfect remake, and it may leave both new players and Naughty Dog diehards disappointed in some respects.But when I finally got far enough in the dark, compelling campaign to relive its jump-scare corridors and epic battles and saw the progress that had been made since 2013, I got it. TLOU Pt. 1 is a rare example of a gaming publisher pointing to a classic \"bullshot\" trailer, then telling a team of developers, \"You get to finish the job. You get to make this look and feel like that amazing trailer.\" And in enough respects, Naughty Dog has done just that.As far as remakes go, TLOU Pt 1 splits the difference between \"wholesale rework\" and \"massive touch-up.\" In terms of narrative and world design, most of the original game has been preserved. Environments, conversations, puzzles, hidden collectibles, and even codes to locked safes are the same.Naughty Dog spent years cutting its teeth on three Uncharted games on the PS3, and the original TLOU was the console's grotesque-yet-beautiful swan song, a game that was able to squeeze incredible environments and dramatic stories out of Sony's famously cantankerous console. The game eventually received a native PS4 version, which merely bumped the resolution and frame rates, yet even this simple port turned out to be one of the PS4 generation's prettier games for a few years.So we're not looking at something like Demon's Souls or even Link's Awakening as remade on the Switch\u2014where the graphical foundation is so massively shifted that you can't help but gawk at it. TLOU Pt 1's graphical leaps are impressive, but they may pass you by if you're not constantly flipping back and forth between the original material. To make my own point, I tested the new version for hours before going back to compare, at which point I realized I was remembering the PS3 original through rose-tinted glasses. The new version's upgrades are so organic that they appear without much fanfare, as if this is how the game originally looked.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

The highly acclaimed show is perhaps the greatest video game adaption ever, and everywhere you go, someone is talking about it. It would have been the perfect pairing to have The Last of Us Part I on PC be the medium for those who haven\u2019t got a PlayStation console and now want to experience the story that made the world collectively cry into their last tissue when Bill said, \u201cyou are my purpose,\u201d but there\u2019s no way in good conscience that I can speak positively of this release.It\u2019s been two weeks since it came out, and one of the reasons we waited to share a review was to see if there was any kind of improvement to the less than satisfactory release. From the moment I booted it up, I was waiting for well over an hour until The Last of Us Part I built the shaders needed for it to look good. For those with a PC likely to be playing on or above medium settings, this process is a necessity. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe how long this process took for me, and there\u2019ll be others where it can last for over two hours \u2013 something nobody should have to endure even after downloading the full game to their PCs.If you\u2019re thinking, \u201chmm, it can\u2019t be that bad if I skipped this process,\u201d then you should take ten minutes to see the various images strewn across the web of Joel\u2019s thick black eyebrows and blocky hair and other monstrous experiences players have had. It looks poor without the shaders built, and while a frustrating process it is to have to wait for it to complete, there\u2019s no way you can enjoy The Last of Us Part I on PC without it. Thankfully, it\u2019s currently at a playable state, albeit some issues with framerate, but this should have been ready at launch, not almost two weeks since releasing to the public.Even after a couple of updates, The Last of Us Part I on PC still suffers from stuttering. While I\u2019m running on high settings on modest GPU I still had multiple framerate issues. It\u2019s now not to the same extent as I originally had, but it can still hinder the smoothness you get on the PlayStation 5 version that came out last year. Visually, it\u2019s wonderful, but with the lagging during pivotal moments, I rolled my eyes on more than one occasion. I tried to reduce the quality to see if this knocked back the framerate issues, but I still had instances where this happened.It\u2019s so frustrating because The Last of Us is such a phenomenal video game. I must have played through at least 15 times over the years, and despite knowing it inside and out, I had to switch to the PS5 for my fix after the show came out. While it\u2019s definitely playable for most people now, it\u2019s tarnished the PC release. Hopefully, these final issues will be ironed out in the next few weeks, but it shouldn\u2019t have taken this long for a game with such love aimed at it to suffer so much, especially as this will be many players\u2019 first time with The Last of Us.The best story of all time\nGorgeous visuals when stableFramerate issues\nShader building takes far too long\nOccasional glitchesThe Last of Us Part I on PC is still suffering from issues, and while most have been put to bed, it's still worth waiting a little longer.

It\u2019s sequel from 2020 won multiple GOTY awards (including ours) for a reason. Naughty Dog harnessed a lot of the technology from it to make the original what it is in this remake to do things that could never have been done, and it feels like a brand new game. From the incredible visuals to its abundance of accessibility features, older fans and new are going to have a blast with it.It was obvious from the very beginning, especially during one of the most famous scenes in the entire game. I don\u2019t want to go too heavy into spoilers in case you are going to be playing for the first time, but it\u2019s necessary to highlight just how impressive the facial animations are. With that being said, if this is your first time playing the the title, I am going to have to mention a very early game spoiler. When Joel is holding onto Sarah, his daughter, and the soldier pulls the trigger that sends a bullet into her chest, it was always heart-breaking to see the scene quickly unfold into tragedy, but with the acute realism now present, it\u2019s even harder to watch.In Sarah\u2019s dying seconds, you can see the pain in her eyes, the life quickly draining from her body. Her eyes tell you everything you need to know about the panic she\u2019s feeling and the acknowledging glance at her father that she\u2019s about to die. Then, as she takes her final breath, a tear trickles from her eye as her heart stops beating, and the air in her lungs leaves for the final time. It\u2019s the way Joel looks at her in these final moments, the way Tommy watches on helplessly, and the way this poor girl\u2019s fate is sealed because of an impossible situation that is the catalyst for everything that comes after.These types of moments come throughout The Last of Us Part 1, and every time they hit differently than they ever did before. More detailed facial animations make everything more real, and more painful to watch. Naughty Dog has always been leaps and bounds above other developers when it comes to conveying emotions through character\u2019s faces, but they\u2019ve gone further in making them look almost lifelike now. The visuals are incredible in the environments, too. As grim and broken as the world around them is, it\u2019s equally breath-taking how the smallest detail is brought to life.I noticed these graphical changes consistently throughout the twelve or so hours playing through it. The way puddles of water rippled under my feet or leaves on the trees moved in the wind. How the light shone through the buildings and reflected off windows, or how cars moved under the weight of my feet after jumping on top of them. Then there\u2019s the gruesome details I noticed, such as when blowing off a soldier\u2019s head with a shotgun and seeing how bits of brain and skull stuck to a wall, slowly rolling down like those sticky toys shaped like men that move down a window. The Last of Us Part 1 consistently impressed me by just how good it looks.AI of enemies has also been vastly improved, and even replaying the same sections after death yields different encounters and attempts to clear an area. In one area before meeting Sam and his brother, I had to make my way through a hotel, and enemies were moving through the rooms, trying to flank me and communicating with one another in an attempt to take me out. These moments are more organic and refreshing to experience, especially as you\u2019ll end up in multiple gunfights throughout the game. Even listening to where they are, or their movements highlighted just how the audio had been improved as well.It\u2019s even more terrifying when a pack of infected run at you unexpectedly, or the sound of a distant clicker can be almost pinpointed to a nearby room. Sounds are clearer and do a better job of keeping you on edge. The clarity in not only enemy noises but general environmental noises factor in to making the world around you feel more alive. In the fear-inducing moments or during calmer scenes, audio has been masterfully improved.The technology on the PlayStation 5 has been utilised in every facet of The Last of Us Part 1. Haptic feedback is present continually, through all the different weapons and how they feel when pulling the trigger, the tension felt when using a med-kit, explosions from a nail bomb, the rumbling of a river as it crashes against rocks at the hydroelectric plant where you bump into Tommy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0f64736-5909-41bb-acdd-c06e9bcc1dac": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0f64736-5909-41bb-acdd-c06e9bcc1dac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "10de2ac6-8ebf-4842-9d12-fc639e2b3d88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0b0e2e53fd720ea9688b712b0f40e43d87784ddb90fa2ce56771761167ba396"}, "3": {"node_id": "d010758c-742f-4a89-a12e-a48c7294b775", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "84a5787e29f96c2ea0d4876c31680a22058226dd1dc31030a65f5d2fc37a269a"}}, "hash": "c51b7e5277cee30ee7654a4d8668916f73d1bc1515f2aef8f946711572b40815", "text": "It\u2019s yet another way in which Naughty Dog has harnessed the power of the PS5 to make the remake feel more authentic and immersive, proving this isn\u2019t just some cash grab.TLoU Part II featured tons of accessibility features, and there\u2019re even more in The Last of Us Part 1. Personally I didn\u2019t use that many, but there\u2019re inclusions for all kinds of disabilities and needs, from audio description for visually impaired players to dialogue playing through the controller accompanied by haptic feedback for those who require hearing assistance. Naughty Dog wants everyone to experience this masterpiece, and it\u2019s a real credit that so much time and effort has been taken to provide a wide range of options for players of all types.The Last of Us Part 1 is so much more than another re-release. It is a remake in the grandest way, bringing everything that made the original special and improving every single aspect of it. Left Behind, the DLC that brought Ellie\u2019s relationship with Riley to our attention has also been included, and it\u2019s just as impressive. Visually, the whole package is incredible, standing side by side with the best titles on PS5. Various audio improvements and technological enhancements made me fall in love with the game all over again, and I couldn\u2019t help being impressed constantly. The best game on PlayStation 3 that became the best game on PlayStation 4, is now, quite possibly, the best game on PlayStation 5.Visuals are incredible\nFacial animations are stunning\nAudio is excellent\nAccessibility features are bountifulThose pallet sections!The Last of Us Part I is a technological marvel, making Naughty Dog's classic story of survival better than it has ever been before. The visuals are sublime as is the audio, and all of the other changes make this well worth playing all over again. Your home for all your videogame needs. Reviews, videos, podcast, news: we\u2019ve got the lot: PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox, PC Gaming!\nAttack of the Fanboy, Remakes and remasters are a core part of the video game industry. If you\u2019ve been around long enough, though, then you know that the terms can be used to describe wildly different products. Some remakes go so far as to completely rebuild classics from the ground up for modern hardware and audiences like Capcom\u2019s recent Resident Evil revivals, while smaller-scale remasters simply aim to make older games playable on modern systems or take advantage of new hardware, such as the latest rerelease of the generation-spanning Grand Theft Auto V.If you\u2019ve been around long enough, then you also know that some remakes/remasters are more warranted than others. Ignoring how the final product turned out, the world had been clamoring for a modern rerelease of the Grand Theft Auto trilogy for years. On the other hand, did the world really need The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD?Regardless of your thoughts on the matter, however, people have generally accepted that enhanced ports are okay as long as they provide substantial enough enhancements. Skyward Sword HD, for example, got revamped controls with a bumped-up framerate and resolution. Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man Remastered got an increased framerate, ray tracing support, and all its DLC collected in one package. There\u2019s a line that companies have to carefully tread when deciding if it\u2019s worth releasing a remake. The Last of Us Part 1 crosses that line.The Last of Us Part 1 is a completely rebuilt version of the post-apocalyptic 2013 classic designed from the ground up as a PlayStation 5 console exclusive. Bucking the trend of Sony\u2019s recent Director\u2019s Cuts, this is a fully-fledged remake in the vein of 2018\u2019s Shadow of the Colossus. Unlike the Bluepoint-developed Shadow of the Colossus, however, this remake was created entirely in-house by Naughty Dog.The original development studio getting a chance to redo one of its most beloved titles, taking what was learned from the development of three big-budget third-person shooters released since \u2014 including a sequel to that title \u2014 is an exciting prospect. Unfortunately, Naughty Dog\u2019s ambitions with this remake of The Last of Us were placed entirely in the wrong areas. While there are some appreciated under-the-hood changes, the main selling point of The Last of Us Part 1 is a very expensive coat of paint for a game that already looked and ran fine in its first remaster.I understand why Sony wanted a shiny new version of The Last of Us on store shelves.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d010758c-742f-4a89-a12e-a48c7294b775": {"__data__": {"id_": "d010758c-742f-4a89-a12e-a48c7294b775", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2432d4fa-2514-4bb6-9cfa-70215239ead0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ca386ada184213520155ff365440c0b41debe3c6a8b961d5df5839a35a096be7"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0f64736-5909-41bb-acdd-c06e9bcc1dac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c51b7e5277cee30ee7654a4d8668916f73d1bc1515f2aef8f946711572b40815"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec8bdebd-3644-4bbb-abac-79e2be43b754", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ec50969be37affcad8bb3a2e65391d964544fad210a727ce1d4dba6b46563ca"}}, "hash": "84a5787e29f96c2ea0d4876c31680a22058226dd1dc31030a65f5d2fc37a269a", "text": "Not only is it a fantastic way to get people even more excited about the still hard-to-find PlayStation 5, but it\u2019s also a way to bring fans of the upcoming HBO series into the PlayStation ecosystem.\u00a0 From a business standpoint, it makes sense to have a state-of-the-art jumping-on point for new Last of Us fans built from the ground up for PS5, rendering each and every one of Joel\u2019s individual beard hairs with such breathtaking fidelity that it\u2019s easy to forget you aren\u2019t watching a prestige television series. While The Last of Us Remastered on PlayStation 4 is still a fantastic-looking game, it\u2019s understandable that Sony would want new fans to have the best possible experience with the first game.The Last of Us Part 1 brings the first game more in line with its sequel. This rerelease makes back-to-back playthroughs of both games in the series flow much more naturally. The overarching story of The Last of Us feels like a more cohesive whole now because of Part 1\u2019s increased fidelity, as if you\u2019re playing through two halves of the same story that just so happens to be on multiple discs like a PS1 JRPG.If there\u2019s one thing to praise about The Last of Us Part 1, it\u2019s that new level of fidelity. While nothing about the plot has been changed and no new lines of dialogue have been recorded, the exceptionally enhanced presentation brings the drama to new heights.The game\u2019s prologue is a known tear-jerker at this point, but the new facial expressions and animations make it feel like you\u2019re witnessing the tragedy for the first time all over again. A thousand emotions are reflected in Ellie\u2019s eyes when she utters her famous \u201cokay\u201d in the game\u2019s finale. The game\u2019s most heart-wrenching scenes will hit just as hard as you remember them. This is genuinely one of the best-looking games ever made, which is to be expected from a studio of this caliber.That brings us to The Last of Us Part 1\u2019s biggest problem: the price tag. This is a fully-fledged $70 release. In a world where The Last of Us Remastered not only retails for $20 brand new but can also be downloaded for free via the PlayStation Plus Collection on PS5, something which the overwhelming majority of PS5 owners will have access to, it\u2019s hard to justify paying a next-generation price for a game that most people have already bought twice.When The Last of Us Remastered already exists, runs at an upscaled 4K/60 FPS, and is backward compatible with the PlayStation 5, is there any reason to buy The Last of Us Part 1? Had The Last of Us never received an enhanced PS4 port, this remake would be welcomed with open arms by most, but as it stands, it feels like Sony is trying to sell The Last of Us Remastered Remastered just to pad out the PS5\u2019s exclusive library.Not only that, but The Last of Us Part 1 is actually a less feature-complete game than The Last of Us Remastered. There are a handful of minor new additions to this remake such as a speedrun mode, permadeath mode, model viewer, and DualSense controller support, but those aren\u2019t enough to make up for the glaring omission of the fan-favorite Factions multiplayer mode. While a standalone Factions game is on the way, its absence in The Last of Us Part 1 still hurts.However, one major new addition will make The Last of Us Part 1 more than worth the price of admission for a select few players: a remarkably in-depth accessibility options menu. Naughty Dog set a high bar with the accessibility features of The Last of Us Part 2, and this remake takes things to the next level with options never before seen in a video game. One such innovation is the ability to play dialogue through the DualSense controller as haptic feedback, allowing hard-of-hearing players to feel the emphasis and intonation of spoken lines.The accessibility features of The Last of Us Part 1 aren\u2019t going to be a huge selling point for the general public, but thanks to Naughty Dog\u2019s efforts, this game will be playable for the very first time for some people. That\u2019s important. There are multiple presets available by default and the controls and settings can be fine-tuned however you see fit. Despite the other issues surrounding The Last of Us Part 1, this aspect of the game deserves to be celebrated.Outside of pricing complaints, The Last of Us Part 1 also feels much more dated in the gameplay department than you would think.

This is a game that predates not only The Last of Us Part 2 but also Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy. Naughty Dog\u2019s game design philosophy was incredibly different back then and it shows.The jaw-dropping visuals work against the gameplay in this aspect as well, making the aging skeleton of a linear PS3 game much more noticeable regardless of how many polygons the shotgun has. Naughty Dog\u2019s level design chops have improved dramatically since the initial release of The Last of Us, and while there are still plenty of memorable set-piece moments like the terrifying hotel basement in Pittsburgh, the moment-to-moment gameplay experience is much duller than I remember.The Last of Us Part 1 functions as a window into the past where Naughty Dog still had a lot to learn. It was an exceptionally talented development studio at the time, but it has become an entirely different level of world-class since then. That\u2019s not to say the combat encounters and exploration segments of The Last of Us Part 1 are bad \u2014 quite the opposite actually \u2014 but with its visual presentation surpassing anything Naughty Dog has done to date, it\u2019s hard to not feel let down by the comparatively bog-standard gameplay.At the end of the day, it\u2019s still The Last of Us though, and even though its gameplay limitations have only gotten more apparent with age, this is still a fine adventure. That\u2019s why this review is so difficult to write and why most will likely have complicated feelings about The Last of Us Part 1. The core game is beloved for a reason and this remake does enhance the experience a great deal, but it\u2019s hard not to wonder what could have been if as much attention was given to the level design and combat encounters as the visuals.The Last of Us Part 1 is a remarkable technical achievement that nobody asked for. Yes, the AI has been improved. Yes, the workbenches have the cool upgrade animations from the sequel. Yes, there\u2019s 3D audio. But when you can already play a good enough version of The Last of Us for free with the PlayStation Plus Collection on PS5, why bother? With a hefty price tag and less content than its more than acceptable PS4 counterpart, The Last of Us Part 1 is an entirely unnecessary remake with gorgeous graphics that only make its dated gameplay stick out even more.This game was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the game's publisher,public relations company, developer or other for the express purpose of a review.\n\nCurrently serving as an Associate Editor at Attack of the Fanboy, Diego Perez has been writing about video games since 2018, specializing in live service games like Destiny and Final Fantasy XIV.
