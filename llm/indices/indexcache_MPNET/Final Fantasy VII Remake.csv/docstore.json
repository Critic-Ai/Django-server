finally be able to say I've played the Remake. After all the wondering how such and such would look, or how this bit will play, I finally have the answers to the millions of questions I had. It's been a long road, and I'm sure like many Final Fantasy 7 fans, part of me never thought we'd get here. But, after many, many hours, I've scoured the entire length and breadth of an expanded Midgar, I've caught up with some very dear old friends, and, I'll be honest, it's been emotional - even if the remake makes a few missteps along the way. It's no easy task to rewrite one of the most beloved stories in videogame history, and given the series' recent shaky past even Final Fantasy 7's most optimistic fans were nervous as to how their favourite characters, moments and story arcs would weather the transition. But I'm happy to say that, for the most part at least, the spirit and tone of the original Final Fantasy 7 is perfectly preserved. Dare I say it, the remake even manages to frequently improve upon the original's telling of the story. Characters you know and love are fizzing with new life and personality, their expressions and movements and little asides capturing the essence of what made them so iconic and enduring. Even the dialogue - which some feared would be stilted given a few previews -  mostly hits the mark. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments as the party chat, bicker, and get to know one another on their journey. And this is also one of the thirstiest games I think I've ever played - Square knows exactly what it's doing as it toys with your affections, making you fall in love with one character after another. If I had my way it wouldn't be so much a love triangle as a love decagon. This Remake is respectful of the original Final Fantasy 7 for the majority of its runtime, right down to specific lines of dialogue being said just so and NPCs being dressed a certain way But it has made a lot of changes too - some small, some story-alteringly huge. The Wall Market, for example, retains most of the little narrative details that made the place so special and fun to explore, but these details have been reworked so that even if, like me, you know the original like the back of your buster sword, exploring those neon-tinged backstreets isn't without some surprises. Bigger narrative beats have been reworked - I won't spoil them here - and it's too early to say whether they've changed things for better or for worse, but they have changed things. The implications for the second part of this project could be absolutely massive is all I'll say. Some changes are smoother in their implementation. Combat is very different here, updated in order to keep pace with modern players. You now control the party as they move freely around the field of battle in real time, where blocking or carrying out basic attacks fill an ATB, or active time battle, bar. With each filled section of this gauge, you can press X to slow time to an almost complete stop and use unique abilities, items, or spells, to make the real difference in combat. It's a smooth transition from the old combat style to the new, and it is far more tactical than it first appears. There are some issues, however, especially prevalent in late game where enemy AI has a tendency to immediately switch its attention to whichever party member the player currently controls, which, when you're forced to switch in particularly difficult fights, makes it incredibly hard to see your strategic planning and placement through to a satisfying conclusion. For the most part, though, it's a thrilling system that capitalises on the individual strengths of each party member, making each one distinctive to control. As always, you'll be leaning on magical orbs of materia to do a lot of the heavy lifting too, and although there are lots of new materia types for veteran Final Fantasy 7 players to get their head around, it all clicks into place organically. Other new additions include weapon upgrades and Weapon skills, whereby you can improve a weapon over the course of the game by spending a character's skill points or SP to alter its core stats, and characters can add each weapon's unique ability to their arsenal by performing that ability a set amount of times, meaning they can then access that ability without that particular weapon being equipped.

Of course, you'll be doing more than just fighting - there are collectibles to find and plentiful minigames, from darts to dancing. Activities that were minor asides in the original have been expanded upon here too. One major worry I had prior to playing the Remake was that it would simply be too short - but rest assured, this is huge. It took me over 45 hours to see the story through to its dramatic conclusion, with plenty of side activities left on the table for the New Game Plus option that unlocks upon completion. More important than all that though, it really feels like Square knew just how meaningful it was that this remake includes even the seemingly inconsequential or throwaway details that fans will be looking out for. This loving and lavish attention to tradition throughout most of the Remake's run time does subsequently make some of the choices towards endgame seem even more confusing, and it's something that's certain to be a point of discussion. It's not all perfectly smooth, though. There's an inconsistency in quality when it comes to some hub areas, and technically it can be a bit of a mess. Some textures load slowly, if they load at all, making some assets look like they were lifted from the PlayStation 2 era. In later sections, I encountered some frustrating data streaming issues, where you'd trigger dialogue with an NPC and it'd take several seconds for the game to load it in. They're minor issues in the grand scheme of things, and they're the kind of problem that can likely be fixed at a later date with some optimisation. But still, they're worth mentioning. One of the worst things about the Final Fantasy 7 Remake is how long we'll have to wait for the next instalment - and the other thing we can't talk about for fear of spoilers. But I feel safe in saying that, for the most part, the Final Fantasy 7 Remake gave me everything I was looking for. What I think it got right another fan may disagree with, and that doesn't mean either of us are wrong. Changes have been made, but the core essence and spirit of Final Fantasy 7 has been preserved brilliantly. Will it still be enjoyable and accessible to newcomers? That I can't be so sure of, but I believe so. What future instalments have in store, who knows, but this Remake gives us some beautiful moments in a universe some players have spent 23 years falling in love with. That alone is pretty special. \n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nAoife Wilson\n\n          Head of Video\n        Aoife is a writer, video producer and TV presenter.

This diverse city made of metal that serves as the backdrop to the entire game already feels so much bigger than it ever did, and I have to take a moment to soak it all in. After admiring the impressive vista, I begin to walk through the slums' streets, bustling with life. People are every which way you look, talking about the events that just transpired, and having run-of-the-mill conversations with one another. You gain a window into the residents' lives immediately, and it makes your first proper introduction to Midgar feel like a living and breathing world from the get-go.Release date: April 10, 2020\nPlatform: PS4 \nDeveloper: Square Enix\nPublisher: Square Enix\u00a0Final Fantasy 7 Remake really lives up to its \"Remake\" title. It truly is a reinterpretation of the classic 1997 release in every sense of the word. Meticulously rebuilt, Final Fantasy 7 Remake succeeds at hitting the difficult balance between staying faithful to the original story and introducing elements that make it feel so fresh and new. Playing the Remake is like returning to a place I once knew and reuniting with old friends I haven't seen in years, but everything is so much more impressively detailed and fleshed out than I remember it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96be5b0a-7375-46ab-acd6-d65e65364c7a": {"__data__": {"id_": "96be5b0a-7375-46ab-acd6-d65e65364c7a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c703f09-46b4-4a02-bb5e-424798ce448d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "41adf977b4330b4f4a860410103755c137fcbcfaed794c8f6990456ea5cf819b"}, "3": {"node_id": "db580bcf-ae93-47eb-bf34-52b52a2f391b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "675e67c2c90a84c8328da89b699599143b2d8301de172ecaae65c875d088f8b7"}}, "hash": "8c22e3ce4542e015bcf5bff1a18fc50a12642faa439a35b28486b5ea5efa4fd9", "text": "As someone who played the original in my formative years, plenty of moments bring a big goofy grin to my face and make plenty of feelings swirl around my heart, but there's so much here for newcomers to enjoy too. As a loving reimagining of the original that delivers a new experience that's wholly its own, it's a spectacularly entertaining introduction to the world of Final Fantasy 7 for modern audiences.One of the main ways the Remake manages to feel new is with its combat system. You now fight in real-time as opposed to the turn-based setup of the original, which makes it feel more action-oriented and fast-paced. Right from the start, you're thrown straight into the heat of battle as you attempt to infiltrate a reactor in the all-famous bombing mission. You jump straight into combat against some of the corporation's security officers as Cloud, a mercenary who's enlisted to help the underground resistance group Avalanche deliver a blow to the Shinra energy company, which is causing harm to the planet.While the combat feels very new, it does still borrow from some of the classic combat features. These include the command menu that lets you choose when to perform spells and abilities and use various items in battle, as well as the ATB gauge that fills up as you fight and dictates when you use your special moves. Every member of the team you fight with has their own particular strengths and weaknesses, which adds to the tactical element of every fight. Likewise, all the varying foes you face will have their own particular weakness you can exploit.The variety of combat styles you can take advantage of helps prevent the fighting from ever feeling too stale, which is aided by your ability to switch between characters at will. Whether it's delivering a swift uppercut punch with Tifa who excels in close quarters combat, popping a barrage of bullets into an enemy high up off the ground with heavy-weight tank Barret, or delivering a finishing hacking blow with Cloud's Buster Sword, the combat is satisfyingly varied. And what's more, it's so rewarding to be in command of how the battle plays out and to see a particularly tough enemy get taken down because of your tactical choices.\u00a0And when I say tough enemies, I mean it. The boss battles in the Remake present a real challenge. You'll have your work cut out trying to take down some of the big bad foes, and every single one will test your ability to adapt to its special moves and fighting habits and press you to work out how you can best use each character's unique abilities to your advantage. Your tactical approach extends to the equipment you have in your arsenal too. As iconic as Cloud's Buster Sword is, every character is able to equip different weapons that each have a unique ability. Their proficiency in that ability will develop the more you use that weapon, so it's useful to try out all kinds of weapons to learn new abilities to use in battle.Outside combat, the story and the way in which the Remake brings its famous characters back is easily its biggest strength and fills the experience with so much humour and heart-felt moments. These are still the characters you may know, but we get to see more sides to them this time. Because of the episodic nature of the Remake, the first portion of the original game has been massively expanded upon, so you see more of the city of Midgar and the characters than ever before. Between all of the action and fighting, the quiet moments you share with the characters are what stand out the most for me. You spend so much more time with Cloud, Barrett, Tifa, and Aerith, and you even get more acquainted with the other members that make up Avalanche.\u00a0Leading man Cloud, with his somewhat aloof personality, is more multifaceted and relatable in the Remake. You see new sides to him that make this effortlessly cool protagonist feel more human and approachable. The same goes for pretty much every main character you fight with. In certain chapters, as you get the chance to explore different parts of Midgar, you'll be spending more time with particular members of the team. From walking around the slums with Tifa, for example, to exploring another sector with Aerith, you see more and more of each character's personality shine through as the story progresses, which adds so much more depth to the story throughout, and helps you become emotionally invested. The ragtag members of Avalanche also get a lot more screen time, so you really feel like you come to know Jessie, Wedge, and Biggs very well. Everyone is so fleshed out, and being given the time to get more acquainted with the cast makes the experience and the events that unfold all the more poignant and affecting.\u00a0Throughout the events of the story, every now and then you'll come across a chapter that offers you a little down time to do some side quests.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db580bcf-ae93-47eb-bf34-52b52a2f391b": {"__data__": {"id_": "db580bcf-ae93-47eb-bf34-52b52a2f391b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "96be5b0a-7375-46ab-acd6-d65e65364c7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c22e3ce4542e015bcf5bff1a18fc50a12642faa439a35b28486b5ea5efa4fd9"}, "3": {"node_id": "20751ed1-8781-4c80-b875-6ca72ced4246", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "efd4d6a9cb999e56405332ca52478b8fb97b0b38b3c7da13bc7ffe9cb9e9623d"}}, "hash": "675e67c2c90a84c8328da89b699599143b2d8301de172ecaae65c875d088f8b7", "text": "As a mercenary who will help anyone if the price is right, Cloud takes on tasks given by the residents of Midgar. Most of the odd jobs involve doing rather menial tasks that aren't particularly too exciting. One, for example, has you heading out to clear out a pesky group of Doomrats that have been bothering the local shopkeeper, while another sees you searching for a little girl's lost cats. While the latter is quite humorous, none of the side quests are ever too thrilling.\u00a0Still, I can see what the game is trying to do by including these side missions. As an unknown merc in the city, doing these odd jobs helps build up Cloud's reputation and can even lead to some perks. The addition of these quests also acts to serve as another way to get to know the different inhabitants of the city, and reinforces the living, breathing feel of the setting. While I didn't enjoy these side quests as much as the main story, there aren't that many to do, meaning they never really get in the way of the action. You can even choose to bypass some of the side quests entirely and continue the story, but the game does reward you for putting in the effort.Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a spectacle from start to finish. You can tell how much care has been taken to bring this story back to life for modern audiences. As a retelling of a classic with plenty of surprises in store, the Remake offers engaging experiences for longtime fans and newcomers alike. Its action-packed combat, engrossing story, and gorgeously detailed setting successfully reminds you why Final Fantasy 7 is beloved by so many.\u00a0I started out writing for the games section of a student-run website as an undergrad, and continued to write about games in my free time during retail and temp jobs for a number of years.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, Square Enix\u2019s dream remake is finally here, with a reinvention of PlayStation 1 classic Final Fantasy 7, but has it been worth the wait?The curious thing about online fandom is that the people that are the most obsessed with a thing seem to draw the least amount of pleasure from it, whether you\u2019re talking about Star Wars or Final Fantasy. We can only imagine how many thousands of hours are going to be wasted complaining about Final Fantasy 7 Remake and how it is, or isn\u2019t, a disgrace to the memory of the original. Certainly, there are a lot of changes, and we can definitely understand some people not liking them, but for us the most important, and perhaps unexpected, revelation is that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is such a fun, unpretentious video game.There are numerous problems inherent in reviewing Final Fantasy 7 Remake, not least that you have to worry about spoilers from the 23-year-old original (which has probably the most famous video game spoiler of all time) and all the new elements from the remake. Then there\u2019s the worry of the remake being too reverent to the original, a game which despite its legendary status had several obvious failings, most obviously a very poorly translated script.Whatever you think of it though, the 1997 original is a milestone game, leveraging the technological potential of the nascent PlayStation and in the process forever breaking Nintendo\u2019s domineering control of third party publishers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20751ed1-8781-4c80-b875-6ca72ced4246": {"__data__": {"id_": "20751ed1-8781-4c80-b875-6ca72ced4246", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "db580bcf-ae93-47eb-bf34-52b52a2f391b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "675e67c2c90a84c8328da89b699599143b2d8301de172ecaae65c875d088f8b7"}, "3": {"node_id": "7e287c45-5789-415b-8f70-5897682fcbc4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d88077d6a8583c1968ad9877ee4858bd2e80fb980aaf6006909b427cd0ee25a3"}}, "hash": "efd4d6a9cb999e56405332ca52478b8fb97b0b38b3c7da13bc7ffe9cb9e9623d", "text": "For the first time, it presented the Japanese role-playing game formula as something palatable to a general Western audience, with more science fiction elements and a greater sense of realism in both the setting and the characters. The remake expands on both these elements, although not without some problems in terms of the former.Since the marketing, rather shamefully, makes no mention of it we should emphasise that this is not the entire story of Final Fantasy 7. It is instead merely the first chapter, with several additional games \u2013 we\u2019d estimate at least three to four \u2013 needed to tell the complete story, as seen in the PlayStation 1 original. The remake covers only the first five hours or so of the original and takes place almost solely in Midgar, a cyberpunk style city suspended in the air on giant plates, above lower class slums on the planet\u2019s surface.Because it covers so little of the original story the plot in the remake is surprisingly thin. It revolves around eco-terrorist group Avalanche, led by Barret, who are convinced that the mako generators that power the city are siphoning off the life force of the planet. Although at first the game presents little reason to believe this, other than that the people in charge of the Shinra Electric Power Company, which controls the city, act like Captain Planet villains and are obviously evil.The plot starts to thicken towards the end but it greatly benefits from the lack of complication by focusing on the characters, in particular ex-supersolider Cloud Strife. We were very worried about how he\u2019d be portrayed, since he was previously a poster boy for 90s style teenage angst, but in the remake he\u2019s much more sympathetic. Socially awkward, emotionally stunted, and seemingly suffering from some kind of PTSD, his reputation is that of a badass but things are clearly much more complicated than that.Cloud shows considerable character growth as the story progresses, bonding with the various Avalanche members, his old friend Tifa, and a mysterious flower seller called Aerith. At first he\u2019s nothing but surly attitude and curt replies, but he slowly learns to trust and engage with the others, in what is a surprisingly subtle bit of character work \u2013 helped by an excellent vocal performance by Cody Christian.Importantly, Cloud is likeable, even when he\u2019s being a grump, and while the female characters do tend to be written a bit too similarly they\u2019re equally engaging and far more interesting than their perfect porcelain features initially suggest. It\u2019s Barret who\u2019s the other big revelation though. He still looks and acts like Mr T, in a performance which borders on the offensive at times, but he\u2019s portrayed as a very well-rounded character who beneath his bluster is frustrated with his own limitations and the act he feels he has to put on in front of others.The plot starts to radically diverge from the original in its denouement, but for the majority of the time it\u2019s a very straightforward story and the only major new additions are the mysterious spectres, that look like the Dementors from Harry Potter, and who are neither clearly threats or allies. There is a lot of other new story content, but most of the rest is used to expand the game world and its society. Although Honey Bee Inn remains a highlight in terms of how it\u2019s presented, both cinematically and in transforming it from a brothel to an establishment with a much more diverse cliental and remit.But while the storytelling is largely a triumph, the changes to the gameplay are even more significant. There\u2019s no other way to put it, but Final Fantasy 7 Remake barely counts as a role-playing game. It\u2019s an action role-player and while there are stats and levels and upgradeable weapons it\u2019s hardly any less of a straight action game than something like the God Of War reboot. We do not say this as a negative, especially in terms of the enjoyable battle system, but it\u2019s certainly going to rub some people up the wrong way.The game is no longer turn-based and instead you control your character directly and use a simple one-button attack system for normal combat. You still have an ATB bar though, which slowly fills up over time (and faster if you land a hit or guard successfully) and allows you to use items and magic abilities. There is a \u2018Classic\u2019 mode that lets the computer control all the characters for you, so you\u2019re only choosing the ATB actions, but describing that as turn-based, as some early source did, is disingenuous.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e287c45-5789-415b-8f70-5897682fcbc4": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e287c45-5789-415b-8f70-5897682fcbc4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "20751ed1-8781-4c80-b875-6ca72ced4246", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "efd4d6a9cb999e56405332ca52478b8fb97b0b38b3c7da13bc7ffe9cb9e9623d"}, "3": {"node_id": "30dab17a-9049-4947-ae7d-ac2715f29155", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc6be8a1f859e20f3410a5086a798e007b09bd937df8f59292613079cf5b9240"}}, "hash": "d88077d6a8583c1968ad9877ee4858bd2e80fb980aaf6006909b427cd0ee25a3", "text": "Not least because it automatically lowers the difficulty to the same as easy mode.But while some may be turning their noses up in disgust at the thought it works very well in practice and while Final Fantasy 7 never had the most complex battle system, even amongst its stablemates, each character has their own set of impressively unique abilities. Barret is all about long range combat and protecting his team-mates, which reflects his personality, while Tifa is a straight up brawler whose abilities change depending on whether she uses a power-up move to turn herself into something close to a straight beat \u2018em-up character.There\u2019s clearly been an influence from Kingdom Hearts in the game\u2019s approach to action role-players, but the combat is much more satisfying and tactical than that, even if it\u2019s not exactly deep. Overall though, the two pillars of story and combat work very well. Both can be cheesy and silly at times, but that comes across as very endearing, as the game embraces its anime sensibilities and, despite what we were expecting, does not shy away from the original\u2019s stranger moments and enemies.Where there are problems though is in the individual chapters, many of which feel like filler even when they\u2019re based on elements from the original. The trek through a haunted train depot, for example, highlights just how simplistic the map design is and how surprisingly poor a lot of the graphics are.The facial animation for the main characters is excellent, some of the best we\u2019ve ever seen, but lesser characters are considerably less impressive, to the point where some almost look like something out of a PlayStation 2 game. There\u2019s a lot of object and texture pop-in, with some high res details never appearing, which is either something that needs to be fixed with a pitch or a surprising failure on the part of the technical and art team.It sounds like the worst insult possible but Final Fantasy 7 Remake could easily be described as a mix of Kingdom Hearts and the first half of Final Fantasy 13, as the remake is extremely linear. You\u2019re always told exactly where to go and what to do during every story mission, to the point where the game sometimes prevents you from back-tracking, while many environments are simple linear corridors, blocked off with debris or some other contrived obstacle.There are no real puzzles and instead you just work you way through the maps, exploring in the only directions you can. The mission and map design is incredibly old-fashioned and yet not in the sense that it\u2019s paying homage to the original game. There are some town hubs that are more open-ended, and you can back track when not on a mission, but there\u2019s only two dozen side quests in the whole game and most are just \u2018go here and defeat this monster\u2019.Not only is the level design simplistic and predictable but so too are the environments, which include such uninteresting locales as train tracks, sewers (twice), service tunnels, and industrial areas. There are some wilderness areas but far too much of the game is just blue-grey corridors and non-descript buildings, which seems a real shame given how much imagination is on display in other parts of the game.Our playthrough lasted around 40 hours, which is roughly the length of the original game, and to be honest a third of the content probably could\u2019ve been cut \u2013 but that was never going to happen in a game whose main selling point is how epic it is. None of the flaws come close to ruining the game though, just as the, different, problems with the original never ruined that.I beat Spider-Man 2 in 14 hours and I want my money back - Reader\u2019s FeatureOnly 1% of Netflix users are taking advantage of a free little-known perkAlan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepThe remake may never be considered a classic in the same vein as the original, but it tackles the almost impossible task of recreating the game for the modern world impressively well.

Its monumental impact on the role-playing genre is hard to overstate \u2013 but even harder to replicate in today\u2019s landscape. That struggle between history and innovation is the engine that drives Final Fantasy VII Remake; the legend of the original looms large over it like the metal plates above the slums of Midgar, but this new version refuses to simply exist under a shadow. With smart (and surprising) additions to a classic world and its inhabitants, Final Fantasy VII Remake artfully appeals to nostalgia without being bound by it.The story follows Cloud and a small band of mercenaries as they fight back against Shinra, a huge company with its hands in everything from experimental weapons to space travel. If you played the original, you will recognize many locations, people, and plot points. But Square Enix has also liberally reimagined and reinterpreted many elements \u2013 but not so much that anything is unrecognizable. This is Final Fantasy Remake\u2019s biggest asset, because it lets old fans relive their memories while welcoming new players with its iconic characters and unique setting.\u00a0Cloud and his companions are still the heroes, but the city of Midgar is the real star now. This game is entirely focused on the portion of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s story that unfolds in this industrial, corporate-controlled metropolis. Midgar\u2019s political conspiracies, everyday desperation, and quiet hope shine through as you explore the different neighborhoods and see the consequences of Shinra\u2019s greed. People live in grimy shacks, huge reactors drain the planet\u2019s life force, and ruins stand as reminders of past tragedies. The maps aren\u2019t as freeform or dynamic as an open-world RPG, but I still appreciate the opportunity to linger in an area and get to know its citizens \u2013 if only through a selection of basic side quests involving item retrieval and monster killing.\u00a0If you\u2019re comparing versions of this world, the remake offers a dramatic expansion of many areas. A whole settlement replaces the few static screens that once represented the sector 7 slums. Wall Market is now a lawless den of sin rather than a few sketchy tents. These areas feel like natural extensions of the world, building the lore and adding context to characters\u2019 interactions. However, a few new zones feel like overcomplicated padding, such as a prolonged and uneventful journey under the sector 4\u00a0plate. But even if the experience doesn\u2019t maximize every minute, my thorough 50-hour playthrough (plus some post-game content) provided plenty of memorable moments.Many of those moments are thanks to Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2019s battle system, which is a compelling fusion of stylish action and conventional turn-based mechanics. You control the characters\u2019 basic movement and attacks directly, but can select specific spells and special moves through a menu. This gives fights a kinetic, cinematic flair without sacrificing the need to carefully assess the evolving situation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f70adc6e-f887-4192-9bde-6a2b51334d5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f70adc6e-f887-4192-9bde-6a2b51334d5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "30dab17a-9049-4947-ae7d-ac2715f29155", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc6be8a1f859e20f3410a5086a798e007b09bd937df8f59292613079cf5b9240"}, "3": {"node_id": "39683804-f031-461b-a044-0adc70fdd9a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "14f17ceadbdf964ccfad53673e50a81eb11f26ca0883f2e66d9539edeb0536a9"}}, "hash": "4c62e06e1c25d20749df5d8fa15057b5053ba80d61f72373e9580624ad6721eb", "text": "This gives fights a kinetic, cinematic flair without sacrificing the need to carefully assess the evolving situation. Every party member controls differently, and you can swap among them on the fly; you might weaken an enemy from afar with Barret\u2019s arm cannon, but then go in with Tifa\u2019s powerful melee strikes once the foe is staggered. This approach is an immensely entertaining way to let each character shine, and fantastic animation and creature design makes the encounters look spectacular. They don\u2019t require pinpoint precision, but they also don\u2019t reward button-mashing, so a majority of battles find the perfect balance between strategy and style.The battles that don\u2019t hit that sweet spot are aggravating, since they feel unfair rather than challenging. One downside to the action-heavy combat is that a lot is happening at any given moment, so important information can get lost in the shuffle, like what spells enemies are casting, or when offscreen foes are about to attack. The cheap hits rarely mean the difference between victory and defeat because combat is generally forgiving, but a handful of important boss fights demand more than this system can accommodate. These encounters can devolve into a tedious mess of second-by-second micromanagement, since the bosses have too much health and your control over your allies\u2019 behavior is extremely limited when you aren\u2019t controlling them directly. Even your small selection of powerful and beautiful summoned beasts (which are cool but unpredictable in their implementation here) can\u2019t do much to turn the tide in situations like this. I don\u2019t mind failure when my strategy is flawed; I gladly restarted battles when I needed to optimize my setup to exploit weaknesses. But in these rare fights, Final Fantasy VII Remake loses sight of what makes its combat fun.When battles are at their best, clever supporting mechanics encourage you to stray out of your comfort zone and explore new strategies. For example, each weapon has a special ability its wielder can use in combat, like the Blade Burst on Cloud\u2019s Mythril Saber. After activating the ability several times, the character learns how to use it without the weapon, which is an interesting way to build a repertoire of powerful techniques while also experimenting with new gear. The materia system is as cool as ever, providing lots of flexibility to try out different playstyles and obtain powerful spells. Other challenges help you dive deeper into the combat, like staggering a certain number of enemies or defeating difficult foes in simulators. Side objectives provide worthwhile rewards, and they are good diversions when you need a break from the main story.Though the plot follows the same outline as the original Midgar section, that narrative doesn\u2019t always have the momentum to support a full game. The individual character moments are satisfying, and I enjoyed getting to know Tifa and the other members of Avalanche better. But when you zoom out, Cloud and his friends are usually just responding to what happens to them, like rescuing a kidnapped friend or escaping after falling into a trap. Shinra is undoubtedly evil, but you don\u2019t get a clear sense of a master plan from either the good or bad guys, which makes the big picture blurry. This becomes even more jarring during the surprising (even if you think you know what\u2019s coming) ending scenes. They are mildly disappointing as a resolution to this game, but much more disappointing in what they imply for any installments that lie ahead.Regardless of what the future holds, Final Fantasy VII Remake finds an impressive equilibrium between its past and its present. Square Enix nods to the original without depending on that familiarity, crafting a distinctive world and exciting combat system that feel modern. The new approach still has rough edges, but that doesn\u2019t stop Final Fantasy VII Remake from carving out its own legacy.\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer.

Their mission is to blow up a reactor that siphons Mako, the lifeblood of the planet, and uses it to power the sprawling industrial metropolis Midgar.

In Final Fantasy VII Remake, having carried out the mission, you're asked to walk the streets in the aftermath and witness the harrowing consequences of your actions. The sector lies in ruin, fires rage, buildings are crumbling, and the heartbreaking human cost is laid bare.A somber violin plays as you walk Midgar's streets, with each pull of the bow across strings tugging at your conscience and stirring the heart, asking you to question whether you're doing the right thing. The cries of confused children echo, people fall to their knees attempting to grapple with the magnitude of what has happened, and citizens decry this so-called group of freedom fighters you've joined just to make a quick buck.As far as statements of intent go, Final Fantasy VII Remake's opening Bombing Mission is a clear and powerful one. This game may be just the first chapter in the reimagining of a much bigger story, but it seeks to uncover depth that was hitherto left to the imagination. It is rich in details that were previously unexplored, realizes new storytelling ambitions with confidence, and presents fresh perspectives that feel both meaningful and essential. It achieves these goals so successfully that it's hard to think that this story existed in any other way.It's important to note that, yes, I have a history with and nostalgia for Final Fantasy VII, and the remake undoubtedly leverages that. However, that isn't to say that what it does will only land for people that know and love the source material. To say that would diminish the smart and careful reconstruction of Final Fantasy VII that the remake is. The majority of the game is new material, lovingly introduced to further detail a picture that had been painted in broad strokes. This isn't a game that panders to fans, as newcomers can also enjoy the majesty of Midgar and learn to love characters for the first time, all while playing a mechanically dense and rewarding role-playing game. Even if it's just a piece of the original Final Fantasy VII, this remake takes one of the most beloved games of all time and elevates it higher.Final Fantasy VII Remake's narrative and characterization achievements are facilitated by gameplay that feels modern but is crystallized around the classic's role-playing fundamentals. In many ways, its gameplay model feels like the culmination of the franchise's evolutions, with ideas from throughout the series brought together in a composite that is fresh but familiar. This is the first time that the action-focused style of modern-era Final Fantasy games doesn't feel like it comes at the expense of the methodical nature of the series' roots. The hybrid style lets you glide between characters at the touch of a button and assume direct control. At the same time, commands can be issued to characters that are otherwise acting independently, conjuring the spirit of that deliberate stand-in-place-and-fight format of old.Also harkening back to the original, the remake uses an Active Time Bar. While it previously dictated when a character could make any move, it now governs whether you take specific actions. The bar split into segments, and special abilities, spells, and item uses have an associated cost. To encourage juggling of party members, the ATB bars fill slowly when they're left to their own devices, but much more rapidly when you take control and attack the enemy directly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61dbfcb4-4707-4ef7-8db1-0ec7a3b617f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "61dbfcb4-4707-4ef7-8db1-0ec7a3b617f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "39683804-f031-461b-a044-0adc70fdd9a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "14f17ceadbdf964ccfad53673e50a81eb11f26ca0883f2e66d9539edeb0536a9"}, "3": {"node_id": "a83bbea9-94e9-44aa-bf5a-0b927d40bad6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a0367ba73701b344736783a84616dba3b03cca5bd79aec2bc79f6dddf8670fb"}}, "hash": "5d2b5bf8254496587c4f49d1d6321dbe4af36779432976f2282484966b29488a", "text": "Characters tend not to initiate the more advanced skills of their own volition, so it's doubly important that you step in and put their resources to good use.Each playable character has a unique skill that comes at no cost and has a great deal of strategic value. Cloud's Punisher mode, for example, unleashes a barrage of quick and powerful sword swings, and reacts to enemy strikes with a counter-attack, but at the expense of his mobility. Barret has a powerful blast, and this can be manually recharged to shorten its cooldown. Tifa's special martial art technique can be leveled up by spending an ATB bar to activate Unbridled Strength, and Aerith's Tempest fires a crystal that does damage on impact, then charges briefly before exploding to hit enemies around it. Each character is also able to use various offensive and defensive magical spells, provided they have the Materia that bestows this ability to them.Materia was and is core to Final Fantasy VII's gameplay. It is solidified Mako energy imbued with arcane knowledge from the essence of the planet and life itself. It manifests as colored spheres that can be slotted into weapons and armor, thus giving the ability to invoke magic to its user or even summon god-like beings to fight alongside you. The beauty of the Materia system was that it allowed you to create loadouts in a very freeform way and build characters to fit your preferred style or strategy for any situation. The Materia system offers the same kind of freedom in the remake. Although each playable character has a general archetype, the Materia system presents a great deal of fluidity within this. I chose to outfit Barret with magical Materia and make him a long-range magician for a while, and during that period he generated AP experience that leveled up the Materia and opened up new, more powerful variations on the skills they housed. I then chose to take all that and give it to Tifa, lending her fists of fury an extra elemental sting. In a particularly challenging battle, I took Cloud's time manipulation Materia and slotted it into Aerith's items so she could hang back and cast haste on the front-line fighters to speed them up, while staying relatively safe.The demands of moment-to-moment combat are high, especially since enemies can be vicious. They seem to work with the goal of creating the same kind of synergy between themselves as you do between your party members. If you're not careful, they will poison and paralyze to create openings for each other, make areas of the battlefield deadly to limit your movement, and pounce on a character to trap them, forcing you to switch characters to free your ensnared party member. Most enemies have some sort of elemental weakness that can be identified using the Assess materia ability and then exploited. Doing so applies pressure to them and, if it keeps building, will stagger them, rendering them completely defenseless. Enemies can also interrupt your actions or move out of the way entirely to evade you, so precise timing is also crucial, otherwise you could expend precious resources fruitlessly. The same discerning approach is needed for your movements. Having an evasive dodge may seem like it would trivialize combat, but many enemy attacks have wide areas of effect or track you, so choosing to guard and take less damage instead of trying to escape it entirely is another key consideration. Thankfully, when issuing commands, the action slows to a crawl to give you time to plan. This breathing room is welcome, but it won't save you from an ill-considered approach.Suffice it to say that the combat asks a lot of you, but it is incredibly gratifying at the same time. Considering the unique ways each character functions, and the behaviour and weaknesses of enemies that require quick thinking and deliberate strategy, feels like playing high-speed chess, and when it comes together you'll find yourself slicing and dicing, freezing and igniting with exhilarating momentum. On occasion, particularly in tighter spaces, the camera can struggle to keep the action in frame, but it's not often enough to be a serious problem. As a whole, the combat has the fluidity, as well as the cinematic and visually stunning flair, of the post-Final Fantasy X games, but also the satisfaction of the \"plan your work and work your plan\" approach of games like Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy XIV. Add on the upgrading mechanics, which allow you to spend points on each weapon to bolster its attributes, and you've got a robust, interconnected suite of RPG mechanics. I can confidently say that Final Fantasy has never felt this good to play.Final Fantasy VII Remake is rich in details that were previously unexplored, realizes new storytelling ambitions with confidence, and presents fresh perspectives that feel both meaningful and essential.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a83bbea9-94e9-44aa-bf5a-0b927d40bad6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a83bbea9-94e9-44aa-bf5a-0b927d40bad6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "61dbfcb4-4707-4ef7-8db1-0ec7a3b617f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5d2b5bf8254496587c4f49d1d6321dbe4af36779432976f2282484966b29488a"}, "3": {"node_id": "c328e454-b397-4dc6-8137-8c8f77c5b4aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5def5959a35cf57d0c8cc18416a34887a24d912c7bb247c9d5c730c508797898"}}, "hash": "5a0367ba73701b344736783a84616dba3b03cca5bd79aec2bc79f6dddf8670fb", "text": "It achieves these goals so successfully that it's hard to think that this story existed in any other wayFor as strong as Final Fantasy VII Remake's gameplay is, it's the narrative and characters that truly stand out as its crowning achievement. For the vast majority of the game, Final Fantasy VII Remake isn't the story of a ragtag group of eco-terrorists fighting for the fate of the planet that the original was. Instead, it's a more focused, deeply personal story. Even though Avalanche's ultimate goal is to free the planet from the vampiric jaws of Shinra, the events that transpire narrow that battle to a struggle for the here and now, instead of the future. Unlike the original, there's also a much greater emphasis on the moral grey areas of the battle. Avalanche essentially pokes the sleeping dragon, and when Shinra retaliates, it's the already-downtrodden people of the slums that suffer.They live a meager existence, albeit one they're comfortable with. As citizens of the undercity, living in the squalor of homes built from rusted metal sheets, propped up and forced together, is all they've known, and all they've known has been provided by Shinra. Just like the ramshackle buildings they live and work in, all they can do is use what they have to hold each other up. Because of that, many don't see Avalanche's fight against Shinra as a clear-cut battle between good and evil, right and wrong, in the same way that Barret and other members of Avalanche do. Walking through the various sectors of Midgar, you'll often hear people condemning Avalanche. The validity of the group's actions are frequently called into question, sometimes by members of the group itself. Tifa, for example, is less caught-up in the cause, even though she takes part in it. When the blowback hits her community, she shows signs of self-doubt, questioning the cause and seeking reassurance from others.In multiple chapters, Remake slows the pace down so that you can spend time in the slums, meet the people there, understand their daily plights, and get involved with the community. In these sections, the game feels closer to something like the Yakuza series, where you're developing an intimate understanding and relationship with a place and the people. This is done through optional side-quests that are seemingly uninteresting busywork. However, barring a handful that are introduced in the late game and can potentially disrupt the momentum, they are worth pursuing. Each one provides some sort of valuable world-building or an opportunity to understand another person a little more. That person could be a young child looking for her lost friends, a concerned citizen looking to rid an area of a monster menace, a reporter investigating a Robin Hood-like thief. Mechanically, side missions are usually \"go here, kill the enemies, talk to a person, or get an item, then return,\" but there's always a little story told within them that pulls you deeper into their world, and each one also humanizes Cloud just a little. As an ex-SOLDIER-turned-merc, he begins taking on odd jobs to make money. His demeanor is cold from the outset and his investment in the struggle is only as much as the coin that pays for it. But as he completes these quests, word of him spreads. The people come to know him, rely on him, and treat him like one of them--he becomes their champion, whether he likes it or not. This not only chips away at Cloud's hard edges, but makes you as the player invest in the world around you and the people within it. Final Fantasy VII Remake is the story of Cloud Strife learning to fight for others, instead of for just himself.Characters that were formerly relegated to bit-parts are given more depth, so you learn more about Avalanche members like Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie, among many others. Though supporting characters, each has their own motivations for taking up arms against Shinra. There are poignant and personal moments with them that are delivered through heartfelt lines of dialogue instead of lengthy exposition. It all feels natural, believable, and relatable. Without spoiling anything, Remake also pulls in characters from the extended fiction of Final Fantasy, some of it incredibly obscure like The Kids Are Alright, a spin-off novel. And these new additions fit in naturally. It feels like Square Enix isn't just remaking Final Fantasy VII--it's rebuilding the larger Final Fantasy VII universe.There's so much texture in these characters, which makes it easy to connect with them.

Jessie is flirtatious, throwing herself at Cloud and hitting him with the hot and cold treatment. She's energetic and vivacious, and you get to learn that there's more to this persona than initially meets the eye. As the crew's weapons expert, she struggles with what her creations are doing to the world around her. Wedge is a soft soul, trying to harden to show that the team can rely on him the same way they would Cloud or Tifa--but maybe a soft soul is exactly what they need. Biggs is cool, calm, and collected--the kind attitude that is honed through a life of conflict, but his history is altogether more touching, and mentioned in a fleeting moment that comes in an optional side-quest.Some odd jobs will have you working alongside key characters such as Tifa and Aerith. For the former, the game elegantly establishes her history with Cloud, with frightening glimpses at their traumatic pasts appearing as intrusive flashes that are the result of some damaged part of Cloud's psyche. This mechanism is also used to weave in the presence of a certain silver-haired villain in a way that didn't appear in the original. The rapport between Cloud and Tifa is depicted so well: They are friends who support each other, but there's also a blossoming romance that builds as Cloud recalls their history and what she means to him.Aerith, the flower girl whose story unexpectedly intersects with Cloud's, is beyond an uplifting presence. The banter between her and Cloud is sweet and funny from the moment you meet her and are unceremoniously drafted into being her bodyguard. She figures Cloud as the silent brooding type with a heart of gold immediately, and sets about poking at his ego and tearing down the walls. She's playful and confident and effortlessly endearing. She always looks for the good in things and, as result, sees the slums for what they mean to people--living under metal plates that block out the sun and amongst cold city steel hasn't dampened her outlook on life. These feel like real people--they have hopes and dreams, fears and faults, they're funny and charismatic, and so well-written and acted that you'll fall for every one. When playing the original, these were all thoughts and feelings I had about the characters that I colored in myself using the outlines the game presented. This time, they're not allusions; it's all painstakingly realized, and as much as I loved the characters and stories back then, I'm able to appreciate them in a much more profound way because of how complete it all feels now.There's so much to marvel at; standing on a plate suspended above Midgar and staring out across the city; hearing each piano note of Tifa's theme played so softly that you can almost picture the fingers gently moving across the keys; walking across the church rooftops with Aerith as an odd calm falls over the city--it's all brought to life with such respect and attention to detail that it's hard not to be overwhelmed and give in to the nostalgia. Then there's the whole Don Corneo plan being hatched and paying off in a way that doesn't feel exclusionary or mocking, but inclusive, fun, and wholly unexpected. The remake doesn't shy away from embracing the goofier elements of the original, instead using it to bring levity to what is otherwise heavy subject matter. Even as the game reaches its conclusion and embraces the more outlandish and fantastical parts of the narrative, it does so in a way that feels earned. Again, this might be just a small chunk of the original release, but as a standalone game Final Fantasy VII Remake is complete. Although a greater villain lingers in the periphery of the story, and cryptic references to something more in Cloud's past--as well as other unexplained elements--are introduced in the concluding chapters, this doesn't diminish the story that is told. Final Fantasy VII Remake can be enjoyed on the merits of what it presents, and for those in the know, it also lays the foundation for future revelations in an intriguing way.Regardless of your history with the original game, Final Fantasy VII Remake is an astounding achievement. The wait for its release was a long one, but in gameplay, story, characters, and music, it delivers--the wait was worth it.

For returning fans, this isn't the Final Fantasy VII your mind remembers, it's the one your heart always knew it to be. Final Fantasy VII Remake was already a stunner of a game on PlayStation 4, but its PS5 upgrade, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, demonstrates just how beautiful a game it really is. Like many PS5 games, the upgraded version offers two graphical modes--one that provides 4K resolution and a lower frame rate, and the other that provides 60 FPS with a lower resolution. With either setting, Intergrade feels like a significant visual leap for an already gorgeous game, sharpening the impressive graphics and making for silky smooth battles.Both presentation modes are definitive upgrades, and the game looks great in both. Additional graphical bells and whistles that take advantage of the PS5's power have been introduced. These include increased volumetric fog in the underground tunnels following the Bombing Mission and lighting that feels like it bounces and bleeds through scenes. FF7R's cinematic presentation is phenomenally well-served by the resolution increase of 4K, with the game's characters and vistas gaining additional detail that makes every clothing texture and building material pop with additional realism. The Graphics mode is simply gorgeous, especially in climactic moments like the Bombing Mission or the battle against Hell House in Corneo's Coliseum. But even little things, like the leather of Aerith's jacket or the wool of Cloud's sweater, gain noticeable improvements that make scenes feel just a little bit more eye-catching.The mode that favors graphics over frame-rate, naturally, is the superior one for presentation, although what you play with really comes down to personal preference. On Performance mode, FF7R becomes exceedingly smooth in both combat and cutscenes, and with the game's deft and often intense camera moves, it often feels like you're whipping through spaces or ripping through enemies with Cloud's sword. Coupled with showers of sparks and blasts of flame in big battles, the enhanced framerate brings a palpable immediacy to the game--although it can sometimes feel a little too intense. Where the enhanced resolution of the Graphics mode consistently looks great, especially with FF7R's fast camera moves, the higher frame rate can occasionally be a detriment. It can feel too fast, as if the presentation isn't always quite optimized and certain moments are sped up with the frame rate. It's sometimes disorienting, but never especially detrimental; and on the other hand, combat at 60 FPS helps show off the quality and dynamism of the game's animations.Apart from graphical improvements, the PS5's claims to fame include enhanced loading speeds (which notably make booting up a save feel near-instantaneous) and haptic feedback in the DualSense controllers. It's on this last point that Intergrade hasn't impressed much. Despite fighting some extremely intense battles to test the PS5 version, including the ludicrously over-the-top Hell House, the haptics didn't do enough to leave an impression. The only point I really noticed them at all were during Cloud's memory flashes on the Bombing Mission; unlike games such as Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart or Astro's Playroom, it doesn't feel like FF7R does much of note in its use of the haptics, even when characters are blowing up scorpion-shaped tanks or escaping an exploding Mako reactor.Still, these issues are minor ones. On the whole, the PS5 upgrade for Final Fantasy 7 Remake elevates an already phenomenal, beautiful game, making it easier to play and more beautiful to behold. If you've been holding back on checking out FF7R up to now, the PS5 version is the superior way to experience it--and you absolutely should.

I can see what Final Fantasy 7 was meant to be when I replay the original, not despite the blocky character models and the awkwardly inserted pre-rendered interludes and backgrounds, but because of them. I\u2019ve always seen beauty in the parts that fall short, the moments where you can sense the developers\u2019 vision of what the game could be hitting the edges of what was possible at the time. Playing the original release of Final Fantasy 7 in 2020 reveals a game with the energy of someone trying to create a blockbuster with the resources of a high school play.

It\u2019s that tension that still makes the original game one of the most interesting experiences of its era. The hardware was powerful for its time, but the team already wanted \u2014 and probably needed \u2014 more. So what happens when those technical limitations are gone, replaced with 23 years of progress? Final Fantasy 7 Remake happens, but how you feel about Square Enix\u2019s effort to remake Final Fantasy 7 today \u2014 greatly expanded and unhindered by the technology of yesteryear \u2014 may say more about your feelings on technology and nostalgia than the game itself. You may see the original as a timeless masterwork or a dated relic, and the lens through which you view this second chance to get it \u201cright\u201d will depend on what you think was \u201cwrong\u201d about the game in the first place. One of the most remarkable things about Remake is that, despite expanding the original game\u2019s opening sections many times over, it still feels extremely faithful to the original. Remake takes the first six hours or so of the original game \u2014 the part that takes place entirely in the stratified, metal city of Midgar \u2014 and expands them into a roughly 40-hour narrative. The rest of Final Fantasy 7\u2019s story will be told in future games. And, though it\u2019s embellished with several new narrative detours, the broad strokes of the story are mostly the same. You primarily play as Cloud Strife, a reticent mercenary with spiky hair and a mysterious past. Cloud falls in with a group called Avalanche \u2014 who are either brave resistance fighters or cowardly eco-terrorists, depending on who you ask \u2014 to prevent the Shinra Electric Power Company from sucking the planet dry of an important natural resource called mako. But Cloud is non-ideological, at least at first. He\u2019s just there for the money. [Ed. note: Final Fantasy 7 is a very old game, but some of the details discussed in this review could be considered very light spoilers.]Cloud\u2019s characterization here is tricky, and only partially successful. He needs to be emotionally distant, because his unavailability is a crucial part of his character arc, but he also has to hold our attention as the central figure of the narrative. And while the original game got to take Cloud through his full journey as a character, Remake is stuck with the Cloud we know at the beginning of that journey. He too often ends up feeling like a blank slate, a stand-in for a general \u201chero\u201d character, but thankfully he\u2019s surrounded by much more expressive characters who pick up most of the slack. There\u2019s Barret, the head of Cloud\u2019s Avalanche cell. Barret always felt like a clunky stereotype, with his tendency for furious outbursts and confrontational language, even in 1997. Square Enix was overly fond of this character type at the time: See also Aya\u2019s partner Daniel from the 1998 game Parasite Eve.That stereotype didn\u2019t entirely define Barret then, and it certainly doesn\u2019t now. We\u2019re given more time to see him being tender with his daughter Marlene in the remake and, while many of us may have rolled our eyes at his angry lectures about the fate of the planet before, it\u2019s now much easier to relate to his righteous outrage at a company that is aggressively pushing the world into an ecological crisis from which it can\u2019t recover. Barret still suffers from some outdated racist characterizations, but the expanded scope of this section of the story at least gives him more to do, and more time to show his humanity outside of what was originally little more than a caricature.  Tifa was always my favorite member of the Avalanche crew because of her no-nonsense demeanor and her tough physicality, and she\u2019s fine here once again, as is Aerith, the flower girl with a deep connection to the planet and a crucial role to play in its fate. For all of this game\u2019s expanded length, however, I didn\u2019t come away with an enriched or newly complicated understanding of these characters. They\u2019re familiar, and I was glad to see them again and to spend time with them, but nothing this game offers with regard to them took any chances or meaningfully affected my impression of who they are. That\u2019s less a criticism of Remake than it is high praise for the original which, in its comparatively lean six-hour Midgar intro, already made Tifa and Aerith feel like characters I was going to remember for the rest of my life.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f6b8233-4872-41b9-83d4-72b0e6bc6551": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f6b8233-4872-41b9-83d4-72b0e6bc6551", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "fad4b3fa-b853-489f-9df2-316f49407343", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "870ed3a2ddd17a1ec8e0596889fc2e0b7ad8a460335c7ec1abcad32f2a012973"}, "3": {"node_id": "d422907c-df8f-4c66-bed9-cb49838f866f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d135a141f49d144fa007b55cff5d54eba201eadfab2bd09c1fc44a96c53b8af7"}}, "hash": "5012b138d05c3883bbcc5262abbac17a817f31d83fa88527faef637c640a4097", "text": "Related\n  Over time, Cloud gradually gets more personally invested in Avalanche\u2019s struggle, and finds that a figure who has played some mysterious role in his past, the enigmatic Sephiroth, is on his own destructive quest on behalf of the planet. But Remake ends just where the original\u2019s narrative really gets going, and turning FF7s introduction into a full release presents some interesting storytelling challenges. Without spoiling anything, it\u2019s fascinating to see the credits for this release roll right when you originally glimpsed the world map beyond Midgar in the original game. The moment that once offered a thrilling feeling of liberation as things really opened up has been replaced by \u2026 well, a new climax that exists as part of the larger, new story. Remake delivers an ending that makes me feel as if I\u2019ve earned a temporary, but significant, victory, while also being clear that there\u2019s more to come. The whole thing still seems stretched, sadly. Most of Remake\u2019s added running time comes not from meaningful new explorations of familiar characters and their relationships, but from things that feel tangential to the main story. For instance, an entirely new quest finds you learning a great deal about a character named Leslie, who didn\u2019t appear in the original game at all, and who works in the service of crime lord Don Corneo. Taken on its own terms, it offers interesting insight into Leslie\u2019s conflicted loyalties and nicely complicates a supporting character who might otherwise have seemed simple, but it also feels a bit superfluous to the game\u2019s narrative core. Leslie could be removed from the game completely and the story would still work, and we know that for a fact because we\u2019ve already played that game. What we don\u2019t know is whether his character has only begun a larger arc that will pay off in a larger way in future releases. It\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re stuck trying to judge these changes without knowing everything about how the story plays out, so some criticisms, or even some praise, should be considered temporary pending the release of future games.Where Remake does do some great work enriching our understanding of characters from the original game is with Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie, the supporting members of Cloud\u2019s Avalanche cell, who were only vague character sketches before. Here, an early detour to the home of Jessie\u2019s parents not only lets us see a suburban neighborhood where people live in relative luxury compared to those in the slums down below; it also gives us a clear sense of just what Jessie is fighting for, and what she has personally sacrificed for her political ideals. Even the people who benefit, at least superficially, from the existing power structure have reason to overthrow it. The opportunity to spend more time with these characters early on becomes crucial later in the story as the battle between Shinra and Avalanche escalates, and the possibility that some characters could die becomes more real. More characters are now more human, and this raises the stakes of the story substantially, although the boss battles do everything they can to deflate that sense of urgency \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that in a bit.  Reviewing this game in the traditional sense is complicated due to the massive shadow cast by the original, but at least the creative team is aware of that. For all its new narrative content, it\u2019s all but impossible to consider Remake as a new, stand-alone work, because it is so clearly, and so often, working to engage with our familiarity with, and nostalgia for, the original. So maybe, to look at this release critically, we have to start at the beginning. What actually makes Final Fantasy 7 so beloved? What should the aims of this kind of remake be? What should be preserved, and what should be erased? It may not even be possible to separate what so many of us loved about the original release from the technical aspects of its creation, especially since removing those limitations changes the game in so many fundamental ways. The remake trades the original\u2019s various, and usually static, camera angles for a more modern, and now-standard, third-person perspective. But while the original\u2019s cameras may have been borne out of necessity \u2014 due to the game\u2019s use of pre-rendered backgrounds that were required to show that much detail on screen \u2014 the constantly shifting perspective gave the original a sort of kinetic visual energy that\u2019s lacking in the remake. The first release, to overuse a term, is much more cinematic, despite its relatively primitive looks.  There\u2019s power and meaning to seeing Cloud as a tiny figure far below you, dwarfed by the industrial machinery of the mako reactor, early in the original game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d422907c-df8f-4c66-bed9-cb49838f866f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d422907c-df8f-4c66-bed9-cb49838f866f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f6b8233-4872-41b9-83d4-72b0e6bc6551", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5012b138d05c3883bbcc5262abbac17a817f31d83fa88527faef637c640a4097"}, "3": {"node_id": "5adce787-7399-466b-a672-362f36e54d39", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "557605ce645828a07242d5ed490da0b7c5df989d246b90cf8f31fdfe885148a4"}}, "hash": "d135a141f49d144fa007b55cff5d54eba201eadfab2bd09c1fc44a96c53b8af7", "text": "There was artistry and creativity in those choices about how to frame different scenes. It was directed, in other words, even if that direction was created out of necessity. The new camera angle has virtues of its own, though. While the original game\u2019s perspective can keep you at a bit of a remove, in Remake, as the people of Midgar\u2019s slums suffer, you\u2019re right there in the thick of it with them, moving through crowds as people lament their inability to find work, or express the trauma of living in such violent and unstable times.So the remake gives as much as it takes. There are visually stunning moments here that weren\u2019t possible in the original. Late in the game, after a colossal disaster has left much of Midgar\u2019s landscape in ruins, you can look down and see buildings piled atop each other far below you like a mess of children\u2019s building blocks. It\u2019s a gutting sight to behold. Characters have more freedom to show emotion due to the huge amount of detail made possible by modern hardware.  When stunning gold and purple sunlight streams in over the horizon of Midgar after part of the massive metal plate blocking the view is removed, you feel the ways in which the world our heroes call home is experiencing massive, irrevocable change \u2026 for good or ill. Updated visuals aren\u2019t always just there for their own sake; Square Enix has found some added meaning in the new tools at their disposal for this release. Other aspects of the game and its story benefit from the Remake treatment as well, perhaps none more than the somewhat infamous Wall Market section. In the original game, Cloud and Aerith come to Wall Market to aid Tifa, who has offered herself up as a \u201cbride\u201d to the lecherous crime lord Don Corneo in order to extract some vital information from him, and Cloud ends up dressing in feminine garb to be allowed into his mansion. The original game suggested that Cloud\u2019s need to dress as a woman was something to be discussed in shameful whispers, and the way it mocked the \u201cmanly\u201d men at the local gym for possessing a feminine wig that Cloud must win doesn\u2019t age very well. Cloud\u2019s quest to gain entrance to Don Corneo\u2019s quarters is now significantly more elaborate. He must earn the approval of Andrea Rhodea, a man who runs a local establishment called the Honey Bee Inn. Earning Rhodea\u2019s respect means sharing the stage with him in a simple rhythm game dance number, and the wonderful thing about this edit is that the sequence with two men dancing together isn\u2019t played for laughs at all, but is instead presented as something both joyous and fun. Cloud is then transformed into \u201ca vision of beauty\u201d by Rhodea\u2019s crew in an upbeat, sexy scene, and when Rhodea tells our newly transformed hero that true beauty is a thing without shame, and that Cloud should never be afraid of it, my withered transgender heart grew three sizes. An out of touch joke is turned into a sincere and fun moment of growth and expression in the remake, which is quite a tonal shift from the original game. A tremendously welcome one. I wish I felt that all of Remake\u2019s efforts to expand on the original were this vital and successful, but many of them just weigh the game down and interrupt the effective, economical pacing of the original. Remember the sight of a giant robot hand in the ruined underpass that Cloud and Aerith pass through? It was a wonderful throwaway detail that helped flesh out the world, but it\u2019s now been expanded into a series of basic puzzles in which you must take control of large mechanical hands to move objects and lift Aerith to places where she can lower a ladder for Cloud. It\u2019s these moments where Remake\u2019s philosophy that \u201cmore is more\u201d starts to show its own limitations. I was sometimes reminded of Peter Jackson\u2019s Hobbit trilogy, which takes J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s genteel children\u2019s book and turns it into three epic, bombastic blockbusters, seemingly failing to understand that it was the relative quaintness of the book that many of us actually adored. Just because the team now has more freedom to show something, or turn a background detail into a puzzle or side quest, doesn\u2019t mean that it always should, and the result is often self-indulgent. And perhaps nowhere is Remake\u2019s tendency to embiggen everything, regardless of the tonal cost it has on the overall experience, more apparent than in combat.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5adce787-7399-466b-a672-362f36e54d39": {"__data__": {"id_": "5adce787-7399-466b-a672-362f36e54d39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "d422907c-df8f-4c66-bed9-cb49838f866f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d135a141f49d144fa007b55cff5d54eba201eadfab2bd09c1fc44a96c53b8af7"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e35f7ef-a83c-451d-a61a-04c5cc33b1cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d70ed8b5c1f325ac18251eaf0c7fab95df1a5306061db765e4a352aec74c1659"}}, "hash": "557605ce645828a07242d5ed490da0b7c5df989d246b90cf8f31fdfe885148a4", "text": "Combat now happens in real time, a huge shift from the original\u2019s turn-based design, but you can only guard, evade, or use standard physical attacks when a fight begins. Your ATB (or Active Time Battle) gauge fills as you attack or take damage, and full segments can then be used to cast spells, use items, or take advantage of your special abilities.You only control one character directly at a time, but you can switch between your party members at will, and time slows to a crawl when you pull up menus to spend your ATB gauge charges or to issue commands to other characters. Combat often turns into a fairly simple affair of using the Assess ability to view an enemy\u2019s elemental weaknesses, exploiting those weaknesses via magic to fill its stagger gauge, and then whaling on it to finish it off. It\u2019s more active, but is that what we\u2019re looking for? Is that what Final Fantasy 7 needs? I\u2019m not so sure. It\u2019s different, but not necessarily better.  The problem with Remake\u2019s combat isn\u2019t one of mechanics, but pacing. This game loves its boss battles. You may think that the original FF7 loved its boss battles, and it does, but Remake game really, really loves its boss battles. Practically every boss fight against a giant mech or a malevolent spirit or a possessed house or yet another giant mech is a multi-stage affair in which you can feel the team straining, as the battle wears on and the enemy shifts from one attack pattern to another to another, to make the battle feel tremendously epic, as if this is some threat the likes of which your party and the world has never faced before. There are diminishing returns for this kind of approach, however, and when every boss encounter is ramped up to the extreme, eventually epic just becomes another word for exhausting. It\u2019s hard to feel like the stakes are being raised by each battle when you know a bigger one is just an hour or two away or, even worse, a comparable one has recently taken place. Remake also adds side quests to Cloud\u2019s time in Midgar, but their effect on the overall experience is negligible. Side quests can be a way to deepen our sense of the world and the people who live there, but only if they\u2019re used well. Side quests in Remake are awkwardly cordoned off from the rest of the game. At a few points, typically upon arriving in a new town, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to stop progressing the main story for a while and run around doing errands for people, but that opportunity closes the moment you decide to resume the central quest. This format prevents the quests from feeling like an organic, integrated aspect of the world and the lives of its people.And the content just isn\u2019t very interesting. You might have to find cats in different spots around the slums, or do a generic go-here-and-kill-the-monsters quest for a generic NPC. They\u2019re filler, in other words, and not particularly enjoyable or inventive filler. For every unnecessarily elaborate new environmental puzzle or boss battle or side quest, though, there\u2019s a new character moment, or a conversation between characters that casts the game\u2019s political concerns into sharp relief. For instance, when you enter the insulated elegance of the Shinra building toward the end of the game, Tifa expresses her awareness that many Shinra employees have no understanding whatsoever of the oppression and suffering that their work fuels. They\u2019re just ordinary people, trying to provide a decent life for their own families. Barret replies that that\u2019s no excuse for their complicity. It\u2019s a nicely complicated moment, one that acknowledges that Final Fantasy 7 has always been political. Remake doesn\u2019t deny that or try to simplify the game\u2019s politics. On the contrary, it makes the fight for the fate of the planet feel personal and urgent, and it allows characters like Tifa to have misgivings about what the right way is to wage that battle, even as she knows the battle must be fought. Remake is wildly uneven, poorly paced, and not entirely successful as a game in its own right. It  takes a game that still feels staggeringly ambitious and often turns it into something more traditional, even if every aspect of the experience is so much more technically advanced. But Remake is also the very best thing a game can be: fascinating. It forces us to confront our subjective tastes, and asks us to consider what we value in the games we play. Your feelings about Remake will be determined by what you, personally, valued in the original release.

What are your favorite parts of Final Fantasy 7, and did Square Enix enhance those aspects of the game, make them worse, or remove them altogether?

This isn\u2019t a replacement for the original game. It\u2019s another take on the same ideas, blown up to fill multiple releases in a way that feels artistically justified in some ways and mercenary in its approach to becoming a commercial juggernaut in others.

Choosing to revise and re-release an old work of art is looking back at it and saying, \u201cYou know what? I could do this better.\u201dSometimes that turns out to be true. Sometimes it turns out to be horribly false. And sometimes, a release comes out that leaves you stunned, wondering what just happened and questioning the very nature of what it means to remake a video game. Must it be a graphical overhaul, faithfully recreating a classic work for modern sensibilities? Or can a remake be an opportunity to right old wrongs, to undo past injustices, to change the nature of your characters\u2019 destinies?Final Fantasy VII Remake, out on April 10 for the PlayStation 4, is a brand new video game wearing Final Fantasy VII\u2019s skin. This remake is still a third-person role-playing game that blends fantasy with cyberpunk. It stars the same characters and explores the same events as the seventh and most popular mainline Final Fantasy, which was released in 1997. Yet this game is also an entirely different creature. For the bulk of its run time, Final Fantasy VII Remake is a glorious retelling of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s story. It expands, tweaks, and fleshes out parts of the game that we\u2019d previously never seen. It takes the first five hours of Final Fantasy VII\u2014which make up about a tenth of the original game\u2014and transforms them into a 40-hour extravaganza, with a new script, a new combat system, and all sorts of new characters.Then it becomes something else entirely.Days after finishing the game, I\u2019m still trying to grapple with the consequences of Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2019s ending, which will be heatedly debated in the weeks and months to come. It\u2019s still not clear just what the developers at Square Enix plan to do next, but the ending makes it very clear that the project\u2019s director, Tetsuya Nomura, has spent the past two decades as the chief creative behind Kingdom Hearts, the messiest and most complicated story in JRPG history. It\u2019s also clear that Square Enix is aware of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s massive cultural impact and wants to take advantage of that. This is an experiment that wouldn\u2019t work with any other game.It\u2019s hard to elaborate without spoiling too much, so let me instead offer this: Final Fantasy VII Remake is a phenomenal game, one that any fan of the series should play. I\u2019m not sure if people who haven\u2019t played Final Fantasy VII will appreciate it as much or find the story all that comprehensible. But if you have at least a basic familiarity with the adventures of Cloud and crew, you\u2019re likely to appreciate what is one of the most audacious remakes that we\u2019ve ever seen in any medium.In 2015, a few months after Square Enix first announced that Final Fantasy VII Remake was in production, they gave us all the catch: It\u2019d be episodic. In the coming years, Square revealed that this first episode would only take place in Midgar, a circular, dystopian city run by an authoritarian energy company called Shinra.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ddb0361-31e5-4c84-becf-5dfe61c62c90": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ddb0361-31e5-4c84-becf-5dfe61c62c90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e35f7ef-a83c-451d-a61a-04c5cc33b1cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d70ed8b5c1f325ac18251eaf0c7fab95df1a5306061db765e4a352aec74c1659"}, "3": {"node_id": "50205fd5-46f3-4040-9475-f5e1cedc69b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d19efffe078f49482da6e651486eeeb1e543e839ba35bf9416ae400f71fac39f"}}, "hash": "2cee251de6a5867d77db9b52afe450d7231546064c25c620a247d2af7e355d18", "text": "Midgar served as the introduction to the original Final Fantasy VII, letting you get to know characters such as Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, and Barret before they headed out into the open world to start the real game.Although Midgar was a fascinating city\u2014a disc-shaped icon to wealth disparity, in which the rich literally lived on top of the poor\u2014it was always the appetizer to Final Fantasy VII\u2019s main course. In the original game, your hero, the spiky-haired, aloof mercenary Cloud, was working for Avalanche, a group of eco-terrorists led by Barret, to fight Shinra. By the time you\u2019d all left Midgar, the story had become something grander\u2014a globe-trotting adventure to track down and fight the enigmatic villain Sephiroth before he summoned a meteor to destroy the planet. (You still fought Shinra, but they were a secondary concern.)In Final Fantasy VII, the Midgar portion took four or maybe five hours to finish. News that Final Fantasy VII Remake wouldn\u2019t leave the city was disconcerting, raising all sorts of questions. What were they doing? How could this feel like a complete game?The answer is simple: Everything\u2019s new. In what will surely be unwelcome news to Final Fantasy VII purists, this remake extends many old scenes and even brings in some brand new ones. The skeleton of the plot remains the same\u2014Avalanche still blows up a couple of reactors; Cloud still meets the flower girl Aerith by falling into her church; your crew still invades Shinra\u2019s headquarters\u2014but the details are all different. It\u2019s as if Final Fantasy VII were the outline of a school paper and Final Fantasy VII Remake is a grad school thesis.\"Someone's wearing Final Fantasy VII's skin\"Cloud simulatorA lovely retelling of the Midgar section of Final Fantasy VIISome padding; technical glitchesSquare EnixPlayStation 4April 10, 2020Around 37 hours completing the game and all side quests.In 1997, the streets and alleys of Midgar were portrayed through cluttered 2D backgrounds and stiff pre-rendered cutscenes; now they are part of a gorgeously realized city. In the original game, you had to let your imagination fill in many of Midgar\u2019s blanks\u2014the squalor of the Sector 7 Slums; the sleek, shiny suburbs on the plate above it; the way each map linked to one another. Now, you can see it all. What was once relegated to a fan\u2019s imagination is now a city that seems to live and breathe.Sometimes, abstraction is better than reality. It\u2019s always tough for a game developer to surpass what\u2019s been locked into a player\u2019s brain after years of imagination. But Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2019s Midgar is truly something to behold\u2014a spectacle at which I could spend many hours marveling.It isn\u2019t just the city that\u2019s built up and overhauled. Dialogue exchanges that took seconds to read in text bubbles in Final Fantasy VII are several-minute cutscenes in Final Fantasy VII Remake. Plot threads that were hinted at in Final Fantasy VII are now fully explored, while chunks of the old game that made no sense have been revised, like the Honeybee Inn, which in the original game is a bizarre brothel. In the remake, it\u2019s something new\u2014a highlight of the game that comes off as surprisingly progressive. (Who would\u2019ve thought that a JRPG might talk about gender fluidity?) Enemies that were throwaway minions in the original game might suddenly turn into uber-bosses, while others might surprise you with fun mechanical twists.Most importantly, Square Enix has finally fixed Final Fantasy VII\u2019s English script. As former Kotaku producer Tim Rogers has described extensively, the original game\u2019s English text was the victim of severe localization issues that led to mangled dialogue and a near-incomprehensible story for North American and European players. (That the game\u2019s plot still resonated so strongly is a testament to the quality of everything else.) Final Fantasy VII Remake fixes that problem with panache, offering a charming script that rarely takes itself too seriously. There are some clunker lines in there\u2014and the occasionally gratuitous cursing feels less like The Wire and more like a teenager at Hot Topic\u2014but Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2019s script is leaps and bounds better than the original game\u2019s, delivered by a phenomenal cast of voice actors who very much seem to be having a good time.You\u2019ve gotta be impressed by the audacity.

Dungeons that lasted a few screens in Final Fantasy VII\u2014like the tunnel just before the Sector 5 reactor and the sewers beneath the city\u2014can sometimes take an hour to finish, which gets tedious. Bosses that were over in 30 seconds in the original game are now hulking beasts or robots with unique weaknesses and multiple phases\u2014sometimes satisfying, sometimes exhausting. The new side quests are mostly monotonous, and the mini-games (darts! Pull-ups! A coliseum!) can be fun but also feel like they exist to be items on a back-of-the-box checklist. I did enjoy the optional battles against summonable monsters from Final Fantasy VII, like the ice queen Shiva. Beat them in a VR simulator run by a Shinra intern named Chadley and you\u2019ll be able to conjure these mystical beasts (and chocobos) during tough combat encounters.Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2019s new script and some added scenes flesh out characters who were previously nothing but faces and names\u2014most notably, the Avalanche members Jessie, Wedge, and Biggs (voiced by returning Final Fantasy actor Gideon Emery, which can be a bit distracting\u2014I just kept hearing Final Fantasy XII\u2019s Balthier). In the original game, these characters were paper-thin and exited the story just as quickly as they entered. Here, they\u2019re nearly as important as your main team. It\u2019s far easier to empathize with the class struggle of Midgar when the people feel real\u2014especially now that their faces actually have noses.Fans might be baffled by the addition of some strange new characters\u2014what, you don\u2019t remember Chocobo Sam?\u2014but they all serve either to help develop the main cast or to add life to Midgar itself. Only a couple of these new chunks of game feel superfluous, like one late-game sequence involving a Don Corneo henchman whose emotional arc is never quite as poignant as the game thinks it is. (He\u2019s presented as an aloof pseudo-villain with a tragic backstory, but his personality is so stoic, he\u2019s just boring.) Other scenes, like a chapter in which Cloud goes to the flirty, agonized soldier Jessie\u2019s house and learns why she\u2019s fighting against Shinra, are delightful additions to the story, enhanced by top-notch voice acting and stunning views of Midgar.Final Fantasy VII Remake hints at old mysteries, giving Cloud plenty of hallucinations and flashbacks (much like the original game), while adding some fascinating new questions. Early in the story, your heroes are introduced to a group of dementor-looking spirits who appear and disappear throughout the game. Their identity is a big question throughout Final Fantasy VII Remake. The answer\u2014and the resolution\u2014changed my perspective on everything.Sometimes, the goal of a video game remake is to make a game more palatable to modern audiences\u2014to update the graphics, fix the controls, and get you playing it on whatever new Xbox or PlayStation came out most recently. Final Fantasy VII Remake is different. Final Fantasy VII Remake invites you to think about what, exactly, should be remade.Take Aerith, for example. In one chapter of the remake, Cloud and Aerith scamper across the ruined rooftops of Midgar\u2019s Sector 5 as they escape from a group of pursuing Shinra guards. In the original game, this is a cute little moment\u201410 seconds of flirting as Cloud teases Aerith for getting tired as they jump. In Final Fantasy VII Remake, it\u2019s breathtaking.Aerith is one of the most improved aspects of this project. In 1997, she was presented as a spritely ally, but the garbled English script lost many of her best lines. In the remake, she feels like a brand new person\u2014a lively, spiritual florist who\u2019s as comfortable cracking a joke as she is connecting with the planet. Final Fantasy VII\u2018s Aerith was charming\u2014Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2019s Aerith is a lovable goofball.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "571e8b31-53cb-41fe-861c-acda72c18ffe": {"__data__": {"id_": "571e8b31-53cb-41fe-861c-acda72c18ffe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "50205fd5-46f3-4040-9475-f5e1cedc69b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d19efffe078f49482da6e651486eeeb1e543e839ba35bf9416ae400f71fac39f"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3b8c351-c011-4168-9f6d-ead6e075d611", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "5616e3dd81ca716bb941ef558038da9d79f094ebcf37f6513826cf6bc2172a4d"}}, "hash": "4d415dfc506f9041e6c67a95655f2c2ad4081429b88dd9964c6fbbe83f7cffe2", "text": "The remake gives her more time to speak and to interact with the other characters, including some wonderful buddy-buddy scenes with Cloud\u2019s childhood friend Tifa. Through those moments, you get a chance to get to know her in a way that the original English Final Fantasy VII never quite pulled off.Or, take combat. Final Fantasy VII had random encounters and turn-based battles; everyone knows that. But was it something its developers wanted to include or something they felt compelled to add to the game because of technical restrictions? Was it just a Final Fantasy tradition to which they had to abide?Combat in Japanese role-playing games started off as something of a metaphor. Memory restrictions on early video game hardware made it impossible to render every single enemy on the map, so they took place on a separate battlefield. Each of the first 10 mainline Final Fantasy games had invisible random encounters\u2014as you were walking around in a dangerous area, the screen would suddenly shake, then transition to a battlefield screen on which your characters lined up opposite your enemies, each attacking when it was their turn. Final Fantasy VII\u2019s battles included some fun flourishes, like special victory poses for each character, but they mostly unfolded in the same way as the previous six games. Final Fantasy VII Remake says: Screw that. No more turns. No more invisible monsters. Technology has advanced past graphical metaphors.Combat in this remake takes place in real time, much like Final Fantasy XV or Kingdom Hearts, against enemies you can see as you roam Midgar\u2019s slums and tunnels. You hack away at enemies using short-ranged attacks for Cloud or Tifa and long-ranged attacks for Barret or Aerith, building up an \u201cATB gauge\u201d (named after the classic Final Fantasy combat system: active time battles) that allows you to cast spells, use items, or execute special abilities. Your effectiveness in combat is augmented by your gear, your weapon upgrades, and your materia\u2014small crystals that can be attached to weapons and armor to enable magic and enhance your abilities.Spamming skills like Cloud\u2019s uber-powerful Triple Slash will do you just fine, but the most efficient way to take out enemies is to stagger them. Staggering opponents, a mechanic adapted from Final Fantasy XIII, knocks them to the ground and paralyzes them for a few seconds while boosting your damage by a significant percentage (typically 160%). Different enemies in Final Fantasy VII Remake are susceptible to staggering in different ways. Some will just fall down when you do enough damage to them, or when you cast a spell targeting their weak point. Others require more unique strategies\u2014one flying enemy, for example, will be more prone to staggering if you dodge their aerial attacks.It\u2019s a strong combat system that only occasionally drags during a bullet-spongey boss (there are oh so many robots with oh so many phases) or filler dungeon (did we really need more sewer levels?). The wrinkle is that you can only control one party member at a time. Whoever you\u2019re not controlling spends battles standing around, occasionally hitting monsters but mostly waiting for you to order them to use spells or abilities. The goal of this system is ostensibly to make you feel like the main character is the one in command\u2014characters even shout lines like \u201cIt\u2019s my turn\u201d when you switch to take control of them\u2014but in practice, it just feels like your friends are idiots. There are some ways to automate ally behavior, like a useful Auto-Cure materia that will make a party member heal anyone who\u2019s in the red, but it\u2019s not ideal. Some sort of rudimentary AI (or at least more materia like Auto-Cure) would have done wonders. As I played, I found myself badly missing Final Fantasy XII\u2019s elaborate Gambit system, in which you can craft your own contingencies for each character (ie: \u201cif you see an enemy, immediately steal from them\u201d). Granted, that was a very different game, but Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2019s ineffective party members feel like a regression.It all makes one wonder: Is this better than turn-based combat? Is it worse? You won\u2019t find yourself mindlessly mashing the attack button\u2014as I have while revisiting the original Final Fantasy VII for comparison\u2014but you might miss some of the more strategy-heavy aspects of the original game\u2019s bosses.

The soundtrack, a brand new take on Nobuo Uematsu\u2019s stirring original music, is full of straight bangers including some wonderful spins on the themes of characters like Aerith and Tifa. Some of the setpieces feel straight out of Uncharted, complete with death-defying leaps across falling debris. Midgar is as beautifully gritty as anyone might hope, and this remake offers a close-up perspective that helps you see the city\u2019s class struggle more intimately.During one sequence, late in the game, as you climb one of Midgar\u2019s pillars in hopes of reaching Shinra\u2019s headquarters in the center of the city, the views are hard to believe. Over the past two decades, plenty of fans have tried to imagine what a complete 3D remake of Final Fantasy VII might look like. Aesthetically, this game surpasses even the loftiest of expectations, aside from a few quirks.There are texture loading issues, for those who pay attention to that sort of thing, which can lead to some weird-looking doors and walls. There\u2019s also a persistent, annoying audio glitch that cuts off characters\u2019 voices when you\u2019re not facing them as they talk. During battle, some of the stock lines of dialogue can get grating, although I did enjoy hearing Barret yell \u201cAsshole!\u201d at a Fat Chocobo.Final Fantasy VII Remake ran at a steady framerate on my launch PS4, and although the console sounded like a jet engine, I didn\u2019t mind. I just cranked up the volume. Midgar was calling.For the past few years, I\u2019ve been loudly cynical about the nature of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project. I\u2019ve been skeptical of the decision to break this game up into episodes, and was especially worried when we learned that the first game took place solely in Midgar. After all, I\u2019ve played Final Fantasy VII half a dozen times. Midgar is burned into my memory. How could they possibly make an entire game out of that four-hour sequence?Playing through Final Fantasy VII Remake, then, was a surreal experience. As I fought through endless waves of Shinra soldiers and helped do chores for the residents of Midgar\u2019s slums, I felt in some ways like I was going through the motions. Okay, just got off the train\u2014now we go to Sector 7. Then it\u2019s time to blow up another reactor. And so on. And so on. Even as I enjoyed the new cutscenes and marveled at the sights and sounds of Shinra, I always knew what was coming next. Cloud\u2019s fall. Wall Market. The train graveyard. The big escape. It\u2019s a weird feeling, playing a game that feels brand new yet utterly predictable at the same time.I marveled at the small moments\u2014the challenging fights, the lovely dialogue exchanges, the explosive new set-pieces. I spun around the camera and tried to take in all of Midgar\u2019s sights and sounds. Final Fantasy VII Remake is unquestionably a good video game, and on a moment-to-moment level, I was really enjoying it.But I was also confident that by the end of it all, I\u2019d feel unsatisfied. Every flashback to Cloud\u2019s razed hometown of Nibelheim or hint about Sephiroth\u2019s clones joining together for Reunion was just a reminder that we wouldn\u2019t actually see those scenes in the game. Every new character or extended dungeon felt like it was taking away time that could have been devoted to chunks of Final Fantasy VII that I knew wouldn\u2019t be in here, like Junon, the port city built around a giant cannon that you visit shortly after Midgar. I wanted to see Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2019s take on the beach resort Costa del Sol, or that glorious flying theme park, the Golden Saucer. I was prepared to burst into tears at\u2026 well, I won\u2019t ruin that one thing. (You probably know the thing.)Then I got to the end and realized that, without spoiling anything, the game\u2019s developers were more or less asking what it means to remake a video game.

Just how much, if anything, do creators owe their biggest fans, the ones who have spent so many years begging for a release like this? By the time I reached the credits, Final Fantasy VII Remake had left me simultaneously thrilled and confounded. I still want to see the rest of the game, but, taking in the sweep of things and noticing the cumulative effect of a succession of surprises, I think I understand what the developers are trying to do\u2014and why it had to be presented and released this way. The answer, of course, is that a remake can be whatever its creators want it to be.Final Fantasy VII Remake is not what I expected. It\u2019s a grand, ambitious, beautiful experiment, a bold new take on a game that millions of people remember fondly. It sometimes feels shackled by the weight of two decades worth of expectations, but it handles those restraints with aplomb. I certainly can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next. As a great man named Barret Wallace once said: There ain\u2019t no getting off this train we on.\nUSgamer, \nThe year is 2020 and a remake of a game I played when I was ten years old is more exciting and relevant than almost everything else. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a reflection of our times. The world is waking up to the realisation that it\u2019s the people at the bottom who keep the gears turning on the machines that support our comfortable lives, while money still flows to the top. This reimagining keeps the fires of revolution burning bright like the tail on a magical lab rat/dog. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is set in the dystopia of Midgar - the entire adventure takes place here, within the confines of the original game\u2019s first city. But what a city! This cyberpunk metropolis is shaped like a pizza, as Barret - leader of eco-terrorist group, Avalanche - constantly points out. The Shinra building is the centerpiece - a self-congratulatory beacon of the corporation\u2019s achievements. At the edge of each slice - called sectors - the mako reactors suck up the planet\u2019s lifeforce. Dilapidated slums sit below a metal plate like a tomato base, lit up by the glow of artificial lights shining down from the steel sky above. Above the layer of steel cheese there\u2019s the upper cities - the topping - where the wealthiest look up to see real stars. You play as Cloud Strife, a mercenary and retired Shinra Soldier - elite fighters altered by mako, giving them distinctive eyes and the ability to swing six-foot swords with twiggy arms. He\u2019s in Midgar for a job from his childhood friend, Tifa, who runs a bar in one of the slums which doubles as Avalanche\u2019s base of operations. The game begins on his first mission with the group, planting a bomb inside a reactor. Everything you remember is here: Cloud flips from the top of a train; Avalanche demolitions expert Jessie kicks a man so hard in the gut he presumably dies; and there\u2019s a fight with a robot scorpion. But it\u2019s all displayed at a fidelity that would have made my brain explode in 1997. The Guard Scorpion fight is a real spectacle, and most of the boss fights across the 40 hour adventure are similarly lavish. It\u2019s not just the battles, though. The interplay between characters is next-level. Everyone is more believable. Each character is distinct and they grow over the course of the story. There\u2019s a tender character moment about midway through that adds more depth to Cloud than was ever possible with the original game\u2019s text boxes - since now emotions can be portrayed wordlessly. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s perfect. Barret is an adorable doofus and a good dad, but he often slips into a Mr. T-style stereotype - he literally says, \u201cQuit your jibber jabber\u201d in fights. Bad. Then there\u2019s Wedge, a fat dude who always talks about food. Also bad. But it mostly stays true to these beloved characters, and new players will likely grow to adore them too. I love little animation touches as well, like how Barret stands with his weight shifted to one side - presumably because one of his arms is a massive gun. Side characters are underbaked, but they have their moments. Early on there are two Shinra troops standing by a gate and you can interact with them to get a handful of different responses. This optional dialogue adds more context to a cutscene that happens later on, rewarding you for your curiosity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0184cf64-3751-40fa-8163-d1b8d21a45c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "0184cf64-3751-40fa-8163-d1b8d21a45c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "6fa17581-9107-4d93-a1a5-f73652f17264", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a19df00fa42bee9dfaaa51221776baead4f8d06d54cb28cfb3f5e436566fc692"}, "3": {"node_id": "04602519-b5be-4476-b82b-9a19992fbc9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b557c37984227fa8fdc9574d131e44be37e2010b892c50a6897f079c1da0ac68"}}, "hash": "73a7e53d00483ba065f6a1203d4fd6e69b3adef626c5d3734ba298e44bc3f201", "text": "It reminds me of that one NPC in the original Midgar whose perspective literally changes as you progress - by the end he realises that he should always look straight ahead so he can have full situational awareness.It\u2019s just lovely. Being with these incredible characters again, combined with the nostalgic music, is almost like a religious experience. Aerith\u2019s theme still stirs something inside me. Exploring the dirty entertainment hub of Wall Market is like stepping through a portal into a childhood dream, though the section you\u2019re looking forward to most here is probably the cheesiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s great, but I wouldn\u2019t have wanted anyone walking in. Thank god we\u2019re in lockdown in the UK, eh? Shame my kids don\u2019t respect me anymore. That\u2019s always been one of the best things about Final Fantasy 7, though - how it fluctuates between serious themes and weirdness. One minute you\u2019re confronting a crime boss who abuses women and the next you\u2019re doing squats with hench gym bros. You can fight a menacing behemoth and summon a giant chicken to help you kick its ass. Characters use the word \u201cmosey\u201d. So, what\u2019s new? Obviously Midgar is now a continuous space, rather than a series of screens you travel between. This means it\u2019s much larger, and there\u2019s spaces between the \u2018screens\u2019. It\u2019s a mostly linear journey, but dungeons are vast - there\u2019s also a bunch of new ones - and hubs are more intricate. These expanded spaces also give the characters more time to bond, with conversations playing over exploration. Again, that wasn\u2019t possible before, since text boxes forced everything to come to a stop for conversations. Relationships now take a front seat. The combat plays out in real-time - you see enemies in the field and it instantly transitions into battle, Cloud pulling the huge sword from his back. Our spiky-haired protagonist has two stances - Operator and Punisher Mode. Operator Mode is for wide swings and damaging multiple enemies while retaining mobility. Punisher Mode turtles you up with the sword facing outwards and allows for more damaging strikes and block counters. You can also bring up a menu to slow time to a crawl as you choose an ability or spell. Every action that isn\u2019t a melee attack, including item use, drains a chunk of your ATB gauge, which you build up by attacking, so you have to juggle between offensive and defensive while keeping your health topped up. Battles are frenetic and exciting. When you master the combat system you\u2019re switching between characters to fire off abilities and combine their damage outputs at just the right time, putting enemies into a \u2018stagger\u2019 status where they\u2019re opened up for more punishment. Each character plays differently, and these differences really shine when you take on some of the endgame challenges in the game\u2019s VR combat simulator - these offer one-on-one duels, and you have to adapt your tactics to suit who you\u2019re controlling. Magic reappears in the form of materia - gems that can be slotted into weapons and armour to be used in battle as spells or buffs. In a lovely touch, you can physically see them on each character\u2019s weapon. Slotting them also improves your stats, much like how drawing magic in Final Fantasy 8 can buff you up. Then there are linked materia slots, where you can use special materia to heighten the effects of the materia it\u2019s linked with. It makes you feel like a master tactician when you rejig your equipment to get an edge. On top of all that there\u2019s your weapons. Each unlockable weapon has its own upgrade path that\u2019s reminiscent of a simplified version of Final Fantasy 10\u2019s sphere grid - you unlock nodes that provide stat buffs. Some are built around raw power, others are built around magic damage or speed. Each also has an unlockable skill you can master to use with any weapon. All of this together makes character building fluid and flexible. I don\u2019t say this lightly, Final Fantasy 7 Remake has the best combat system in a 3D Final Fantasy game.

Most of the sidequests are like something out of an MMO: you talk to an NPC, they tell you to go kill something. Each hub has five or six of these. Only one of the sidequests led me to an interesting battle, and I had to backtrack through a dungeon to get there. Before release, Square Enix said this remake was built with new players in mind. There\u2019s plenty of nods for fans - wait until you see what they\u2019ve done with one of Final Fantasy 7\u2019s most ridiculous enemies - but there are a bunch of new cutscenes and characters too. This story can be spoiled. Be vigilant. Some of the changes are huge, and not entirely successful. I won\u2019t go into details, but one tweak left me feeling like I\u2019d been conned. And newcomers will likely just have no idea what\u2019s going on. Characters that were fleshed out over the course of the original game feel rushed and without context - it\u2019s like you\u2019re expected to know who they are. It is too meta. While I\u2019m excited for the next game, I felt deflated for an entire day after the credits rolled. But the journey is completely worth it. Midgar is so well-realised, the main characters are wonderfully done, and the battle system is masterful. I can see myself moseying through the entire 40 hours again. At times it felt almost overwhelming to actually be playing it - like Square Enix had made a game specifically for me. I just wish the loyalty to the source material lasted throughout. Despite that, there\u2019s no denying that this is the best Final Fantasy has been in a long time. This game are sick.

Final Fantasy VII sits among the pantheon of true video gaming legends like Super Mario Bros., Halo, and Zelda: Ocarina of Time. FF7 is a game that people have an almost holy attachment to, and when Square Enix announced a remake in 2015, video game fans everywhere went wild.Producing a remake of a beloved game is a tall order. To put it bluntly, Final Fantasy VII isn\u2019t Call of Duty. A bad remake of such a huge game (both in scope and in popularity) isn\u2019t something you can come back from in a year. With the herculean effort needed to bring the intricate world of FF7 into a modern gaming framework, the future of Square Enix likely hangs on whether this remake succeeds or fails.With so much on the line, it\u2019s impressive that Square Enix took Final Fantasy VII Remake in the direction it did. I don\u2019t intend to spoil anything for anyone, but rest assured, it took a lot of guts to make this game.Buy Final Fantasy VII Remake on Amazon for $59.99More than likely, you already know the story of Final Fantasy VII. A mercenary joins forces with an eco-terrorist group called Avalanche to strike at a massive corporation called Shinra that is destroying the planet by exploiting a resource called Mako to generate power. Of course, that relatively simple premise ends up ballooning into a massive, globe-spanning adventure, but for Final Fantasy VII Remake, you just have to worry about the initial part of the story.Final Fantasy VII Remake is the first episode in a series of games that will re-examine the classic story we all know and love. It takes place entirely in Midgar and follows Avalanche as they attempt to weaken Shinra\u2019s iron grip on the planet. Fans of the original will be glad to know that FF7 Remake is faithful to the source material throughout Midgar. There\u2019s no cut content here or drastic changes in how events play out. However, almost every aspect of the story in Midgar has been expanded in some way.One of the aspects of Final Fantasy VII Remake that fans are going to love is how far it goes to flesh out the world. In the original game, you could finish Midgar and be on the world map in 4-6 hours. In the remake, that\u2019s been expanded to 30-40 hours. You may think to yourself that the new material has to be padding to add that much time, but it\u2019s not at all.For example, some of the added content fleshes out Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie\u2019s stories.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e766d61-886b-4037-b728-5ae54dde0c56": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e766d61-886b-4037-b728-5ae54dde0c56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "7297403f-fee3-439c-96ee-20017b5f45ef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "22dde8f1c1d6c69284fb113e10b88e5b120808b4d09e95e9cef519d7a5b78fbb"}, "3": {"node_id": "d62204fb-9f80-463f-ace4-409f299ff006", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d50a11f950d947aea5d02b42bbfc970dd2825f79bf6ea0ae7f8a4092e70ffc9"}}, "hash": "18bcb37501dd1d42c7667ea71f46c6385f3a72baa90221f5be8a3db06ee0bd92", "text": "In the original, these Avalanche members were treated as close compatriots of Barret and Tifa, but we never really got to learn about them outside of the bombing missions, and nary a word was mentioned about them post-Midgar. This time around, you get to know all three of them, their pasts, motivations, and aspirations. Just getting to know these three characters more adds a ton to the game, and that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg.Some purists won\u2019t be happy with a few of the changes in the game, though. Some events play out a bit differently than they do in the original, and some minor characters have been slightly altered while new ones have been introduced. I felt these changes and additions came out well, and added some exciting new facets to FF7\u2018s lore, but some people are going to be livid.Environmental design in FF7 Remake is some of the most impressive I\u2019ve ever seen. If you\u2019ve played the original, you\u2019ll know that there wasn\u2019t a ton the devs had to work with. Those pre-rendered backgrounds are still charming today, but they\u2019re only one static view of an area that must now be rendered in 3D. Somehow, though, Square managed to completely realize Midgar while still retaining the design language of the original game.The thing players will likely notice most about their time through Final Fantasy VII Remake\u2018s Midgar is scale. It\u2019s shocking how much our imaginations filled in the blanks with Midgar back in 1997. Looking back, the static backgrounds of the original game did a poor job of driving home just how vast Midgar is. Now, though, when you walk through the Sector 7 slums, it\u2019s immediately apparent how many people live their lives in squalor under Shinra\u2019s boot, and you can look up and see just how oppressive the plate feels.Surprisingly, Square Enix didn\u2019t reuse a lot of models and textures over and over throughout Midgar to pad out the environment. Each area in Midgar has its own architectural design and aesthetic, so even the Sector 5 Slums and Sector 7 Slums feel vastly different. It would have been easy for the devs to copy and paste the same shack 100 times and say, \u201cwelp, there\u2019s the slums done,\u201d but they went above and beyond to give each part of Midgar its own sense of individuality.It\u2019s incredible to see places you walked by so many times in the original FF7 in 3D. Even little spots like the automated item shop in Wall Market with the malfunctioning machine gun are there for you to see. I didn\u2019t notice a single removed location throughout my playthrough, though some areas have been rearranged to accommodate new buildings.Unfortunately, Final Fantasy VII Remake is the game that finally makes the PS4 look long in the tooth. Try as it might, even the PS4 Pro can\u2019t keep up with the massive amount of textures the game throws at it. Most of the time, the game is gorgeous, but sometimes the PS4 has issues with switching from low-res to high-res textures when you get close to objects. A day-one patch might fix this issue, but I imagine it\u2019s at least partially a hardware problem at this point.Final Fantasy VII Remake moves to a real-time combat system that goes into slow-mo when you issue commands. You control one character at a time, but can give orders to up to two others while fighting, and you can switch between them at any time.I found fighting in Final Fantasy VII Remake to be the best in the series to date. It manages to blend the aggressiveness of Final Fantasy XV with the strategic combat found in turn-based games. It\u2019s action-packed while still giving you the chance to slow down, assess your enemy\u2019s weakness, plan a strategy, and execute it.New in Final Fantasy VII Remake is the stagger gauge, which is the central concept of the new fighting system. In the original game, the overriding impetus in each fight was to deplete your enemy\u2019s HP to win each battle. In FF7 Remake, you can either try and attack in a way that will consume an enemy\u2019s health as quickly as possible, or focus on filling its stagger gauge to force it into a position where it can\u2019t fight and takes added damage.Because of the stagger mechanic, the best strategy isn\u2019t necessarily causing the most damage you can anymore.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d62204fb-9f80-463f-ace4-409f299ff006": {"__data__": {"id_": "d62204fb-9f80-463f-ace4-409f299ff006", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e766d61-886b-4037-b728-5ae54dde0c56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "18bcb37501dd1d42c7667ea71f46c6385f3a72baa90221f5be8a3db06ee0bd92"}, "3": {"node_id": "fceaa28a-a8c0-44e8-885a-745bf3a56867", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fec44574930f943cbd8d6f9da2e5b322ad803f0fa0cd691d799d8773300efd0"}}, "hash": "6d50a11f950d947aea5d02b42bbfc970dd2825f79bf6ea0ae7f8a4092e70ffc9", "text": "In most fights, the safest and most effective way of eliminating enemies is to concentrate on filling their stagger gauge until they\u2019re vulnerable, then hitting them with an alpha strike of your most powerful attacks.Each character has their own playstyle in Final Fantasy VII Remake, which doesn\u2019t make their stats their only real differentiator. For example, Cloud is an all-rounder, Tifa is a glass cannon, and Barret is a long-range/tank. This means you\u2019ll want to customize each character\u2019s loadout of equipment and materia to take advantage of their strengths. So, you might give Tifa HP Ups to make up for her lower health and equip her with accessories that add to her strength stat.The increased differences between each character\u2019s performance in combat add a lot to the fighting system, and I can see it really impacting the game in later episodes when your party is up to its full complement. So far, in the first episode, the game has already made me think a lot more about party composition. This is a notable improvement over encouraging you to plop the two characters you like best and Cloud together and never look back.There\u2019s a ton more I\u2019d love to say about Final Fantasy VII Remake, but I don\u2019t want to spoil the experience for anyone. While it may seem like Square Enix mostly played it safe from what I\u2019ve said so far, that\u2019s anywhere but the truth. This remake really stretches the definition of the word by adding an incredible amount of depth to the source material.The only misgiving I have as a reviewer is that those who haven\u2019t played the original Final Fantasy VII may not get as much out of the experience as a longtime fan. This game is obviously developed for those who have played and love FF7, and I think a lot of the nuance of both the new content and the plot additions will be lost if you\u2019re not familiar with the source material.I applaud the team behind Final Fantasy VII Remake for not targeting it toward the lowest common denominator and going above and beyond to make the game an experience that will surprise even those who know FF7 backward and forward. It would have been a lot easier to just stick to a 1:1 graphical update of the original game, but Final Fantasy VII Remake is so much more than that.I adored the 40 hours I spent in Midgar, and they passed far too quickly. I can\u2019t wait to see how the second episode of the remake series turns out, and it feels like I\u2019m back in 1997, staring bright-eyed out into the distance at the end of Midgar\u2019s highway.Square Enix took a gamble with Final Fantasy VII Remake, and not everyone is going to be happy with it. This will likely be a divisive title amongst the fanbase. However, I\u2019m someone who played the original game when it released, and it\u2019s one of my favorite games of all time, and I was absolutely thrilled with this reimagining.My recommendation is to go into Midgar with an open mind and allow it to wash over you. Final Fantasy VII Remake is a video game experience we only get every once in a while, and it\u2019s one of the best titles I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of playing.GameRevolution reviewed Final Fantasy VII Remake on PS4 with a copy provided by the publisher.GameRevolution is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.10Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

I think for a lot of people, Final Fantasy VII Remake\u00a0is going to have that same impact.I know what you\u2019re thinking, but this isn\u2019t really about nostalgia: the remake is a straight-up good RPG that builds off a great foundational story.\u00a0There\u2019s a lot\u00a0that\u2019s changed, and it\u2019s safe to say this is one of the most comprehensive remakes ever created. Previously throwaway characters now have motivations and personality thanks to modern technological advancements and a bit of creative storytelling. There\u2019s brand new cast members, several of which slot right in naturally and a few that are clear sequel-bait.But really, it\u2019s the atmosphere of Midgar that wins out as the true pivotal character of the remake. Seeing kids frolicking in the playground in the intro that was once barren in the original PlayStation entry gives us new context for the city and the class-based politics that define it. Midgar, which has been ingrained in popular culture for several decades, is more alive than it\u2019s ever been. Aerith (Aeris) is perhaps the remake\u2019s biggest direct triumph, as she gets more of a chance to shine beyond her duty as a healbot that only had a place in select parties. Plus, she made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion with her zingers, which is always a plus. If this was my first time ever experiencing the FFVII\u00a0story, I\u2019d still be enamored by these characters.A lot is also cleaned-up with the new coat of remake paint. Cloud\u2019s freakouts are a little more grounded and less goofy looking. Even rando NPCs speak, and sidequests, for the most part, are fun to complete: especially when coupled with an automatic teleport turn-in system. The grunt workers of Shinra are more humanized and less cartoonish, though the latter qualifier still applies for several of the main mustache-twirling higher-ups. The new score also does a great job of channeling the original soundtrack while maintaining its own feel: especially those killer jazz track remakes. Like the remake plot changes, some are better than the source material, some aren\u2019t.Actually, a lot of it (especially the injection of Sephiroth as seen in the game\u2019s trailers) is going to be controversial for purists, but newcomers generally won\u2019t care and I don\u2019t either; outside of some issues with a very weird (Nomuraaaaaaa!) last act. In terms of technical problems, I encountered very little: light audio issues for 10 minutes (a muted dialogue track) that worked after restart, and a few pathing issues that cleared up after several seconds.Naturally everyone will want to partake, not just veterans. For newcomers,\u00a0Final Fantasy VII Remake\u00a0pulls out all the stops for making everyone feel comfortable. There\u2019s an easy and normal difficulty setting available right off the bat, with a third \u201cclassic\u201d mode that serves as easy-adjacent, allowing characters to attack and defend automatically, while you simply perform commands like a JRPG. If you find yourself in hot water while fighting a specific boss, you can swap your setting without penalty.The chapter-based setup is also extremely digestible, which is going to be give and take if you\u2019re expecting a sprawling, open world complex RPG (more on that in a moment). After a guided intro (Remake\u00a0begins just like the original, with the initial bombing run from the demo), the slums of Midgar (where Tifa\u2019s bar is located) becomes your home hub. That hub is like a giant wheel with spokes, which lead to sidequests and stores to buy stuff from.The end result is more of a hangout Shenmue\u00a0feel and I\u2019m all for it.\u00a0The gist is that you\u2019ll do a bunch of stuff in a hub, then go to the critical path objective to select a \u201cget to the mission\u201d dialogue option, do a linear story-based section (or two, or three), then return to a hub. I repeat: this is not an open world game. There\u2019s a ton of walking involved, a lot of which is cinematic in nature. Since a lot of you are dying to know: there are no QTEs.Near the end (Chapter 14 of 18) the game starts to open up more, with fast-travel available for that particular hub: then the Remake\u00a0transitions into a guided narrative tour for the rest of the experience.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cebfb8cf-5793-4a94-bc7e-cead742b3921": {"__data__": {"id_": "cebfb8cf-5793-4a94-bc7e-cead742b3921", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "fceaa28a-a8c0-44e8-885a-745bf3a56867", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fec44574930f943cbd8d6f9da2e5b322ad803f0fa0cd691d799d8773300efd0"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b0d3445-3440-4765-972d-920289b33a5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a4c19f58d9f74bf29d35dfb9d07f692ea7146904938708eba8314031f1d9506"}}, "hash": "d107cd020a7683dd7dfe3bb632f075d175771bafffaacd603c6db03cb6cba21e", "text": "While future episodes (we\u2019ll get to all that later) could stand to be a little more open, especially with a, you know, open world, it fits this portion of the narrative as Midgar to an extent was always like this.Another obvious change is combat, which is kind of like a more restrained and refined version of FFXV\u00a0(or an evolution of another recent Nomura project).\u00a0Remember when I said that each character had more of a chance to shine earlier? The new combat system also facilitates that. Cloud and Tifa are the close-ranged king and queen, with\u00a0Barret fulfilling a ranged damage role and Aeris as the spellcaster.\u00a0Tifa is arguably the most interesting party member, sporting a fighting game-like skillset with launchers and abilities that combo off of each other.Combat is like a mix of an action game and a traditional JRPG. You can move around, dodge and defend at will, then queue up a menu of commands (like magic, items, or abilities) that essentially stops (drastically slows) time. It\u2019s not the most tactical or difficult RPG combat system to master, but there\u2019s a lot to like. Forcing players to expend ATB bars (which is built up over time by attacking or taking damage) to use abilities, spells or items is a smart move. It prevents you from spamming potions or cure spells, putting the pressure on you to act wisely and make every choice count in some of the more complex battles.Most \u201ctrash\u201d (fodder enemy) fights aren\u2019t super interesting, but fun to play and watch. Bosses on the other hand put all of the systems to the test, as you need to actually try to follow the weakness and stagger parameters or you\u2019re going to be guzzling potions and dipping into your savings to replace them. That said, even with all that in mind, it wasn\u2019t until Chapter 12 that I hit a game over screen. Late-game simulators that disallow items (or force you into a higher difficulty) provide more of a challenge, but that isn\u2019t available from the start.Part of the reason I had a smooth experience is because I spend an exorbitant amount of time in menus, building my characters. In Remake, you spend SP (earned through battles) to upgrade your weapons and AP (also from battles) to level-up materia. The former foundation is predicated on \u201cbuying\u201d new stat increases or passive powers through a skill tree (more of a skill solar system, really) and the latter allows you to get creative in assigning roles to characters by slotting in different pieces of materia.Trying to figure out the best possible builds for each party member was a lot of fun. I decided early on that Cloud was responsible for \u201cfire and ice,\u201d while Barret focused on tanking with damage-drawing support materia and a penchant for lightning to boot. Tifa was my thief with her steal materia always equipped and held up the rest of the elemental bargain with air and ice magic. Every player is likely going to try something different that works for them: that\u2019s how effective the materia system is even decades later.Even if the combat system isn\u2019t getting you going, a lot of the emotional narrative appeal of the remake spills through to the combat. Hearing Barret shout the victory fanfare theme song as you rush from fight to fight is enough to make you smile. The key here is that like pretty much everything Nomura does, it looks absolutely fantastic at all times and errs on the side of emotion. Watching Cloud lean back as the slow-motion effect pops up and slam a soldier down with a Braver slash is stylish as hell.Well, the time has come: at some point we need to talk about the nature of the remake\u2019s delivery system. Although this game is technically called Final Fantasy VII Remake, it should probably have the subtitle \u201cPart One.\u201d This actually does feel like a \u201cfull release,\u201d but it is only part of the story, with many loose threads hanging by the end.\u00a0 For reference, my first run of the game took roughly 35 hours. That was with doing every sidequest possible and exploring every nook and cranny of the map (to my knowledge), as well as maxing out\u00a0all magic (green) materia. There\u2019s a few minigames sprinkled in too, but it\u2019s easy to dry that well up as the rewards aren\u2019t that hard to earn outside of the late-game VR training missions that are meant to test your mettle.\u00a0I squeezed in another five hours and nearly reached a 100% completion rating.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b0d3445-3440-4765-972d-920289b33a5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b0d3445-3440-4765-972d-920289b33a5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "cebfb8cf-5793-4a94-bc7e-cead742b3921", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d107cd020a7683dd7dfe3bb632f075d175771bafffaacd603c6db03cb6cba21e"}, "3": {"node_id": "e39212bb-bd3b-466c-8f08-2db17249e579", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ea592072574afca48420d04870726ae642409eefd6270dd044caa02e39aa557"}}, "hash": "9a4c19f58d9f74bf29d35dfb9d07f692ea7146904938708eba8314031f1d9506", "text": "I squeezed in another five hours and nearly reached a 100% completion rating.\u00a0Like the story\u2019s hanging threads, there is a \u201cto be continued\u201d feel with a few mechanical concepts too.

It\u2019s almost all the way there in just about every respect, but stops short on a few accounts. Now I\u2019m willing to wait for the follow-ups, but it was still worth it to play this remake\u00a0\u2014 first part or not \u2014now.I kind of agonized over rating Final Fantasy VII Remake. It\u2019s going to garner a lot of discussion from people who are both blown away by the new treatment and disappointed by it, and those feelings are not mutually exclusive. In the end\u00a0\u2014 after thinking on it for some time and removing nostalgia from the equation entirely\u00a0\u2014 I came to the conclusion that this world is full of powerful characters and a setting that\u2019s worth remembering: remake or not.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]SuperbA hallmark of excellence.

While I am firmly in the camp of Final Fantasy VI being one of the best games in the series, I cannot deny that Final Fantasy VII impacted the lives of millions of gamers worldwide and was an amazing game in its own right.So a remake of Final Fantasy VII would be surely a complete no brainer from a business standpoint and gamers would be elated at the news. Well, back in 2015, gamers were definitely ecstatic about the news of a remake but as time passed, people got worried that Square Enix would mess with the secret sauce and nullify what made the original game so great.This was because it wasn\u2019t long until we heard the news that the classic turn-based Active Time Battle system had been dropped in favor of something more action oriented and fluid.Well, the game is here and it\u2019s an incredibly well wrought game but it\u2019s not exactly what I would call a remake.Visually speaking, this will hit fans of Final Fantasy VII right in the nostalgia. The recreation of characters such as Cloud, Tifa and Aerith are amazingly done and the city of Midgard has been reproduced in a truly amazing way.Functionally though, things are quite a bit different.This remake is visually impressive throughout.Put simply, this is now much more of an action role-playing game compared to the original and that will understandably rub some people the wrong way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e39212bb-bd3b-466c-8f08-2db17249e579": {"__data__": {"id_": "e39212bb-bd3b-466c-8f08-2db17249e579", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b0d3445-3440-4765-972d-920289b33a5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9a4c19f58d9f74bf29d35dfb9d07f692ea7146904938708eba8314031f1d9506"}, "3": {"node_id": "a916b462-022e-4b6e-b044-b5870dd229a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b23b66ab6adff682456a504a26dbc1191b58e93e1988e2375ec277077e62e404"}}, "hash": "3ea592072574afca48420d04870726ae642409eefd6270dd044caa02e39aa557", "text": "The Normal setup has you effectively attack enemies in real-time but with an ATB gauge that refills giving you access to things like spells, items and abilities.You can switch this over to Classic mode, which is more automatic in terms of the combat but actually feels somehow worse, as characters attack automatically.Thankfully you can still switch between party members and that\u2019s where the combat gets interesting, as different characters have varying setups that keeps battles lively.The issue here is that this is a big departure from the original game but it is done incredibly well and actually works.This means that if you purely view this new combat setup on its merits alone, it\u2019s very well done but it\u2019s not exactly what I would call faithful to how the original game worked.You still have all the backend upgrades and Materia, which is obviously great and refreshingly direct after overly complex upgrade systems in other recent role-playing games. However, the issue here for some is that this is not so much of a remake of Final Fantasy VII but more of a rebuild.This brings me onto the story and it\u2019s had a very definite and surprising overhaul. I obviously won\u2019t spoil that here but suffice to say, you will not expect how things develop if you played the original game.The more action-oriented approach to combat is a big departure from the original game.The amount of narrative here is also a lot more than the original game, as this remake only covers the initial section of the original story but drags out it over a much longer timespan.It\u2019s definitely fun and engaging but it does get a little repetitive and padded out in places.While we all thought this would be a straight up retelling of the Final Fantasy VII story in multiple installments, I really do not know what to expect next and that in its own way is quite exciting.In some ways, it helps that I am not as invested in the original Final Fantasy VII compared to many others that will pick this game up. I am coming based on what the game is, rather than what I thought it could be.On its own, this is a fresh and fascinating action role-playing game set within the world and setting of Final Fantasy VII and that is remarkable to behold. It will also likely introduce whole new swathes of gamers to the plight of Avalanche and still amaze old-school players like me.If you were expecting a faithful remake of Final Fantasy VII, then you will be left confused but not disappointed. This is a properly crafted game from the visuals to the functionality and even the story.Overall, this is an amazing game that works on its own and fleshes out the story and setting of Final Fantasy VII in a remarkably cogent way. Fans of the original game may have wanted something more faithful in a functional sense but this is still an excellent game and one you will be more than happy to pour your time into.Final Fantasy VII RemakePlatform:\u00a0PlayStation 4Developer:\u00a0Square EnixPublisher:\u00a0Square EnixReleased:\u00a0April 10th 2020Price:\u00a0$59.99Score:\u00a08.5/10Disclosure: Square Enix sent me a copy of this game for the purposes of this review.Follow me on\u00a0Twitter,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0YouTube.

Login NowHow does Final Fantasy 7 Remake compare to its 1997 polygon counterpart? Find out in our review.In 1997 the world was introduced to one of the first fully 3D Final Fantasy games. It brought JRPGs to the mainstream, and for many gamers including myself, Final Fantasy 7 was the first Final Fantasy game we played from start to finish. The game was incredible with fully 3D models, a compelling story arc with interesting characters, lots of spell animations, secrets, and huge environments you could openly explore and interact with. While the game does not hold up in 2020, the original Final Fantasy 7 was a state of the art RPG for its time. Now 23 years later, Square Enix has rebuilt and reimagined this piece of video game history with Final Fantasy 7 Remake.Going into the FF7 Remake I had moderate expectations. I was a huge fan of the 1997 version that not only enthralled me with it\u2019s amazing story and colorful characters, but also helped me greatly improve my reading comprehension. I played the game reading aloud to my little brother who was 8 at the time. The game brought us closer together and was a very personal experience. Being 12 years old and following the journey of Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aerith and others to save the world on the original PlayStation, I thought would be a once in a lifetime experience.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a916b462-022e-4b6e-b044-b5870dd229a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a916b462-022e-4b6e-b044-b5870dd229a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "e39212bb-bd3b-466c-8f08-2db17249e579", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ea592072574afca48420d04870726ae642409eefd6270dd044caa02e39aa557"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f9e7ace-93e2-4603-a4c0-e0307edc81ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ec59e1ac5686df0c57d06d36025e7a7fce82dd8c16062e10cf4f1d9b1ea5fbf"}}, "hash": "b23b66ab6adff682456a504a26dbc1191b58e93e1988e2375ec277077e62e404", "text": "Somehow Square Enix managed to create an entirely new game that transformed me back into my 12-year-old self sitting in the rec room, my eyes glued to the screen unable to look away. It\u2019s more than just nostalgia. What Square Enix has done here is, simply put, incredible.It all starts with a spectacular cutscene that includes the same iconic music that introduced you to the world of Final Fantasy 7. The game takes place in a giant metropolis called Midgar that was built and run by the privately-owned Shinra Electric Company. There is no government in this world. The Shinra Electric Company functions like a government for the city; supplying housing, electricity, water and law, but it's not good. It's an authoritative regime that can pretty much make its own rules. It rose to power by harnessing and refining an earthly resource called \u201cmako'' which has endless uses like generating fuel for cars, providing electricity and other strange attributes as you\u2019ll come to learn.For the majority of the game you\u2019ll play and control Cloud Strife, a former soldier or form of elite military guard. You\u2019ve been hired by an eco-terrorist force called Avalanche to destroy a mako reactor owned by the Shinra Electric Company. You\u2019ll be introduced to some of the key members of the group including Biggs, Wedge, Jessie, as well as the passionate and easily angered Barret Wallace, who leads the team. Barret believes that if Shinra keeps harvesting mako from the planet it will eventually die and things will stop growing, hence why you\u2019re hired to help blow up the Shinra Mako Reactors. The game\u2019s story starts here, but the characters, their motivations, and the plot expand exponentially from there throughout the playthrough.Returning fans of the original 1997 game will recognize characters, locations, enemies and a whole lot more, but this time around the experience is unreal. Most of the 1997 game used an isometric camera angle. In the 2020 remake, the camera is third person, street level. Square has taken great care with this new viewpoint and it makes the city of Midgar come to life. People talk about current events while you walk around the streets, shops are open for business, and kids play in the alleyways. You really feel that this is a real place with real people and real problems. This is a simple, great design that sucks you into this fantasy world in a natural way.The first moments of the game are linear one-time affairs that you won\u2019t revisit again, but they are fantastically done set pieces that add a tremendous amount of character to the world itself, setting the stage for the surroundings you\u2019ll play through. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is environmental storytelling at its finest and there\u2019s a lot to take in. I took my time viewing the ambiance of each sector and suggest players do the same to really get the most of what the Final Fantasy 7 Remake has to offer.The game\u2019s story takes place over a series of 18 chapters and each chapter took me around two hours to complete. The whole game takes place within the city of Midgar. Each section of the city is assigned to Sectors 1-8. After players escape the opening bombing mission, they will run into Aerith, the flower girl, in Sector 1. This is where veterans of the series will notice a major change that will come into play in later chapters of the game, but, I don\u2019t want to spoil too much here.You visit multiple sectors in the city that are much more open and larger than the 1997 locations. Each Sector has sections that act as large open hubs or levels. I don\u2019t want to say this is an \u201copen world\u201d game because it's not. However, the sections are pretty large in scale each with their own unique look and feel as well as specific side quests, mini-games, and secrets. What\u2019s nice is that if you do continue the main quest line the game will warn you that if you proceed, certain items, side quests, and dialogue encounters will no longer be available. Some gamers might not like this, but I appreciated the heads-up so I could backtrack through the areas to see what I had missed before leaving and triggering world changes. There are still secrets and items you can miss just like in the original game.Players make their way through these large areas with a mini-map or navigation bar to help them comb the steampunk slums of Midgar. It\u2019s good to know that while shops are marked on the map, not all side missions, quests, and objectives are displayed.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f9e7ace-93e2-4603-a4c0-e0307edc81ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f9e7ace-93e2-4603-a4c0-e0307edc81ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "a916b462-022e-4b6e-b044-b5870dd229a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b23b66ab6adff682456a504a26dbc1191b58e93e1988e2375ec277077e62e404"}, "3": {"node_id": "06837c20-aa5f-4ecd-84ef-47d9bffb7f65", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "40caad29045fcf36fd70822935048d080471a79bf3faffcd3b935949665f3165"}}, "hash": "2ec59e1ac5686df0c57d06d36025e7a7fce82dd8c16062e10cf4f1d9b1ea5fbf", "text": "This means you\u2019ll have to explore and enter a radius until you see a green exclamation point, listen to the quest givers for hints on where to go, or just explore yourself.

In fact, towards the end of the game, a lot of old locations open up creating an expansive more open world to explore and revisit. Much like the original 1997 FF7 did at the very end.The battle system in Final Fantasy 7 Remake is best described as brilliant. Somehow Square Enix was able to take a turn-based game made in 1997, modernize the system, and make it feel just as simple, and fun as the original. All the combat is real time. While certain enemy encounters are scripted, players will have random fight encounters just like in the 1997 version. However, they only happen in certain locations in the large hub maps away from populated areas.When you enter combat you\u2019re able to dodge, block, and attack in real time. While you do this, a bar called the ATB bar slowly fills up to two charges. It fills faster if you attack or block. Once a bar is filled, you can execute a command and time will slow to a crawl giving you ample opportunity to select a special ability, cast a spell, or use an item. Each character in your party has one standard unique ability and another based on the weapon currently equipped. Once players have used the weapon\u2019s ability a certain number of times in battle, they will get \u201cproficient\u201d with it and it will become permanently added to the character. This encourages players to experiment with new weapons to learn their unique abilities and become stronger. After each battle, your character will get XP and level up, increasing their stats and awarding skill points.Spells are cast by means of equipping green, blue, purple and yellow orbs called \u201cMateria\u201d in item slots. Some of these are as simple as casting fire, ice, or thunder damage while other spells have passive effects, improve your battle prowess, or give you unique abilities like being able to steal items from enemies. This is where the RPG aspect really comes into play. Players are able to build each character the way they want to fill its role in combat be it a healer, damage dealer, tank, or glass cannon. You can link two types of Materia slots together to boost the power of a spell, enhance its effect, or increase the amount of XP the Materia earned after each battle. That\u2019s right, your spells can level up and get more powerful the more you use them in battle. However, spells have a casting time. The more powerful a spell, the longer the time the character needs to cast it. You can be interrupted during this time by certain attacks, preventing the spell from going off, wasting your ATB bar and draining your MP\u00a0 in the process.The famous Limit Break makes a return from the 1997 version. As your character takes damage, it fills the limit bar. Once the limit bar is filled, players can execute a beautiful animated power attack that does massive damage. Unlike the 1997 game, the remake only has 1 Limit Break per character. Players don\u2019t get a different version after you level up, you only get one. This may disappoint some fans as Cloud only has Cross Slash, Aerith uses Healing Wind, Tifa can Somersault, and Barret packs a punch with Big Shot.Players will have a lot of tools at their disposal for fights but it\u2019s not as simple as hitting it until it dies. Early on in the game you receive Assess Materia. Using this gives players details about an enemy; their HP, resistances, weaknesses and overall advice on how to defeat them. Both common enemies and bosses have a life bar and a stagger gauge. Hitting an enemy with its weakness element or interrupting an attack with an ability will cause \u201cpressure\u201d which causes the stagger gauge to fill rapidly. Once full, the enemy is stunned for a certain time and can take up to one hundred and 160 times bonus damage. Each encounter becomes a beautiful ballet dance of dodging, casting, timing, and exploiting weaknesses. When everything starts to flow together and synergizes with one another, the game gives players an incredibly gratifying feeling of accomplishment. You just feel like a badass pro esport player when doing it right.Players will have up to three party members at once. Sometimes fewer depending on the story section being played. You can switch between them in real time during battles for direct control, or command them via shortcut keys.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06837c20-aa5f-4ecd-84ef-47d9bffb7f65": {"__data__": {"id_": "06837c20-aa5f-4ecd-84ef-47d9bffb7f65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f9e7ace-93e2-4603-a4c0-e0307edc81ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2ec59e1ac5686df0c57d06d36025e7a7fce82dd8c16062e10cf4f1d9b1ea5fbf"}, "3": {"node_id": "0bea064c-c814-45d6-89d7-a9978f9b7f25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ac9388c968cda9f3948f1636f0fc3e7865fe20b8b175a463232b9ca89541756"}}, "hash": "40caad29045fcf36fd70822935048d080471a79bf3faffcd3b935949665f3165", "text": "Your AI teammates are pretty competent in dealing damage, blocking and dodging attacks, and won\u2019t waste their ATB bar unless you command them to do something. It helps in most fights, especially boss encounters, that enemies are usually focused on the character you\u2019re directly controlling. This gives you time to issue longer casting commands to other teammates while the enemy is concentrating on you. Be aware that stuns and status effects like sleep are absolutely devastating if you get hit with them and can quickly lead to a failed battle encounter. Players must learn enemies patterns, cast Assess, and fight smart. Button mashing attacks will not get your team through boss fights or big encounters.While each character can have a loadout to your liking, they do have unique battle roles, speed, and dodge animations. Cloud exceeds at close range attacks. Barret is slow, but can attack from a safe distance while dealing consistent small damage. Tifa is super-fast and excels at filling the stagger gauge and increasing the damage modifier of staggered opponents. Finally, Aerith, who's probably the most unique character, can cast AOE wards and other effects that assist the party on a magical level. The combat gameplay in FF7 Remake is a thing of beauty when you\u2019re dancing and dodging around the battlefield in a synergy of attacks and abilities, staggering enemies with devastating combos.Like any RPG, players level up after gaining a certain amount of XP. Each time you level up, HP, MP, and stats increase slightly as well as defense and power. However, a new feature in Final Fantasy 7 Remake is the addition of Skill Points. Every time you level up, you get SP. These points are put in a skill tree that\u2019s attached to your equipped weapon's core. Each weapon has different modifiers. Some focus on magic aspects, others all out defense, or pure attack power. What\u2019s amazing about this system is that Skill Points are each unique to the weapon you are using. No weapon is better than another. They\u2019re just different in their skill tree. This adds another layer of depth to FF7 Remake wherein you decide which weapon best suits your style of play. This is unlike the 1997 game where better weapons were just that, better. It allows players to use Cloud\u2019s starting weapon, the Buster Sword, for the entire playthrough if they choose. I love this game for giving me options for how I want to play instead of forcing me into a roll of damage or defense. Each character has several unique weapons to collect and some are easier to find than others, prompting the player to explore and complete side quests for a nice reward.A new non-playable character, Chadley, shows up in certain main hubs. He asks you to obtain data to improve his research and in return he develops new types of Materia for you. This boils down to doing things like combat challenges that task you to stun a certain type of enemy a number of times, assess x-amount of creatures, and so on. The challenges are a fun little distraction, and also the only way you can get certain types of rare Materia. Chadley also offers you Summons Materia, if you can beat his VR battle simulator challenge. Shiva, Fat Chocobo, and Leviathan can be earned in the battle simulator. It\u2019s fun battling them, especially with the amazing remix of the song \u201cThose who fight further\u201d playing in the background.Summoning in battle is a tad more limited this time around. In the 1997 game you could use summons once per battle, any battle. And some of them, like Knights of the Round, were incredibly hard to earn and vastly powerful once obtained. Summons in Final Fantasy 7 Remake work a lot differently. Rather than being able to summon them at will, the Summons Materia is only available at certain times in scripted boss fight encounters and even then you can only summon one for the entire battle. They are incredibly powerful attacks and, unlike the 1997 version, they stick around for an extended time, deal damage to the enemy, and you can even issue commands for them to do special attacks. At the end of the time limit they\u2019ll perform a massive AOE damage move before they disappear. If the party member who summoned them is knocked unconscious, the summons timer will immediately end. This was clearly for balance reasons but some hardcore fans will be let down.One area where Final Fantasy 7 Remake shines is in its visuals. The large levels and enemy designs are just fantastic. It\u2019s really the scale of everything that\u2019s impressive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bea064c-c814-45d6-89d7-a9978f9b7f25": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bea064c-c814-45d6-89d7-a9978f9b7f25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "06837c20-aa5f-4ecd-84ef-47d9bffb7f65", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "40caad29045fcf36fd70822935048d080471a79bf3faffcd3b935949665f3165"}, "3": {"node_id": "65794110-2adb-4c89-a064-79e0dadc7606", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "173dc3220d9ff00aae40175335b147bf31694c043932ff53acb5b020acfa4304"}}, "hash": "1ac9388c968cda9f3948f1636f0fc3e7865fe20b8b175a463232b9ca89541756", "text": "It\u2019s really the scale of everything that\u2019s impressive. Having buildings on fire, trash ridden alleyways, and multiple models on screen at once with particle effects, animations, and no frame rate issues is a huge accomplishment on current generation hardware. That said, it does come at a price. Pop-in textures are fairly common and frequent. Especially if you are running through an area quickly. While most of the environments look incredible from afar or as a whole, if you start to stare too long at a small item or object, you can start to see where Square Enix had to scale back. Some of the Sky Domes in the game look outright awful, but players will not fret about the sky domes too much as they will likely be focused on the magnificently designed characters.The character designs are nearly flawless and simply gorgeous to look at. They\u2019re expressive and very animated. Fans of the original FF7 game will appreciate the mannerisms and movements of some characters that mimic their polygonal PS1 counterparts. What\u2019s even more amazing is the attention to detail. Materia slotted onto your character\u2019s weapon is shown in game and in cutscenes, and it looks fantastic. Weapons and armor accessories are also visible when you equip them on characters. Everything looks beautiful, from Cloud\u2019s sword, to Tifa\u2019s gauntlets, Barrett's gun arm, and Aerith\u2019s staff.These amazing character models would be nothing without some of the most impressive voice acting performances that I have heard in years. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is voiced by some very talented actors. Every one of them explodes with personality, even the mild mannered ones. John Eric Bentley, the voice of Barret, is a particular stand-out, delivering a fantastic performance. This is what really holds the story together since there are a lot of cutscenes. It\u2019s through these amazing animations and spectacular voice acting that players are immediately sucked into the world of Final Fantasy 7 Remake. This is helped even more thanks to some fantastic dialogue writing. I laughed several times at certain conversations due to outstanding timing and line delivery. Towards the end of the game, players will feel that these characters have become friends and they start to feel like a family. A family of misfits who you care about.The music of Final Fantasy 7 makes a return in the form of grand orchestral remixes. The themes have been dulled down quite a bit though. Most songs are still there and some are great. In fact, some will catch you off-guard when they fade in, allowing you to have a laugh and grin as you remember that song in the original 1997 game. However, some themes are very subtle, too subtle, and if you\u2019re a big fan of the 1997 score, you may secretly wish the music was a bit more on-cue with the original game. There is new music as well and most of it is great. However, there were situations where the environment did not match the music playing and was a little off-putting. The music isn\u2019t bad by any means, but some people may not like the new subtle take on some of the classic themes.Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a story-based game first and foremost. While the combat, large levels, and RPG mechanics are in full force, the journey of Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, and Barret are at the forefront. There are a lot of cutscenes, but you never get tired of them thanks to gorgeous visuals and superb voice acting. While some of the major story beats and bosses have remained the same, not everything is here. Fans expecting a 1-to-1 remake of the original game will be met with massive disappointment. There is some glaring stuff that changed or was moved around and some stuff just didn\u2019t make the cut. It could be your favorite line of dialogue, a mini game, side quest, or set piece.There\u2019s a lot of new content here, and die-hard fans of FF7 will mostly enjoy everything that\u2019s new. Especially with the development of Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge, since they\u2019re given a lot more time in the limelight this go-around and you dive into their history much more than in the 1997 game. That said, not everything added was great. There is one addition that seems out of place. A new character, who I won\u2019t spoil, abruptly appears for two quick boss fights then disappears and is not seen again for the remainder of the game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65794110-2adb-4c89-a064-79e0dadc7606": {"__data__": {"id_": "65794110-2adb-4c89-a064-79e0dadc7606", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bea064c-c814-45d6-89d7-a9978f9b7f25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1ac9388c968cda9f3948f1636f0fc3e7865fe20b8b175a463232b9ca89541756"}, "3": {"node_id": "84e2bd6c-9410-49c9-ab81-9b2452f294f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffee6d1c84996188f7f860fc8e5830c3b66f503a78f5af2c4e77a8e97b904557"}}, "hash": "173dc3220d9ff00aae40175335b147bf31694c043932ff53acb5b020acfa4304", "text": "They feel really out of place and don't really expand on the story or its characters.As players continue the main story quest line they will run into new and old characters, expand their arsenal of weapons, increase combat battle knowledge, and get just the right amount of nostalgia for old-school fans. Around the 80% completion mark, the game soars, reaching new heights, making you excited to keep pressing on and invested in the outcome of these characters as these weird glimpses of Cloud\u2019s memory start to form. You\u2019re excited, ecstatic and on the edge of your seat, even if old-school fans know what\u2019s next. However, at the ending, or rather where the game should have ended, things take a turn for the worse.I\u2019m not going to ruin the end of the game here but I will say the last one and a half hours of the game is a slog, a drag, an unnecessary over-the-top crescendo that didn\u2019t need to happen. The game spends 35 or more hours building up this world, these characters, and these mysteries only to abruptly whip you violently into a Kingdom Hearts 2-like boss fight that\u2019s more cinematic than an actual battle. It completely breaks the tone, style, and story of the world you just spent the former half experiencing. I became more upset, disappointed, and devastated the longer this end segment went on. I didn\u2019t enjoy this. The game should have ended but it didn\u2019t. An hour and a half of just something that we didn\u2019t need to play or see. Something that will most likely confuse newcomers to the series. I consider myself a huge FF7 fan and I disliked every minute of it. It wasn\u2019t needed and felt tacked on for fanfare or game length. However, this small part of the game that I didn\u2019t care for did not negate my overall enjoyment of the entire game.Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a masterpiece, a love letter to FF7 fans, an homage to one of the greatest games of all time. At its best it does everything the original did in 1997, revolutionizing the way video game stories can be told and reimaged. Square Enix has created a wonderful game full of characters, set pieces and stories for a whole new generation of players to follow the journey of Cloud Strife and his friends on a mission to save the world. Even though I personally didn\u2019t care for the last hour or so of the game, I can\u2019t deny the amazing effort Square Enix has put into Final Fantasy 7 Remake.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a reflection of our times. The world is waking up to the realisation that it\u2019s the people at the bottom who keep the gears turning on the machines that support our comfortable lives, while money still flows to the top. This reimagining keeps the fires of revolution burning bright like the tail on a magical lab rat/dog. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is set in the dystopia of Midgar - the entire adventure takes place here, within the confines of the original game\u2019s first city. But what a city! This cyberpunk metropolis is shaped like a pizza, as Barret - leader of eco-terrorist group, Avalanche - constantly points out. The Shinra building is the centerpiece - a self-congratulatory beacon of the corporation\u2019s achievements. At the edge of each slice - called sectors - the mako reactors suck up the planet\u2019s lifeforce. Dilapidated slums sit below a metal plate like a tomato base, lit up by the glow of artificial lights shining down from the steel sky above. Above the layer of steel cheese there\u2019s the upper cities - the topping - where the wealthiest look up to see real stars. You play as Cloud Strife, a mercenary and retired Shinra Soldier - elite fighters altered by mako, giving them distinctive eyes and the ability to swing six-foot swords with twiggy arms. He\u2019s in Midgar for a job from his childhood friend, Tifa, who runs a bar in one of the slums which doubles as Avalanche\u2019s base of operations. The game begins on his first mission with the group, planting a bomb inside a reactor. Everything you remember is here: Cloud flips from the top of a train; Avalanche demolitions expert Jessie kicks a man so hard in the gut he presumably dies; and there\u2019s a fight with a robot scorpion. But it\u2019s all displayed at a fidelity that would have made my brain explode in 1997.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d0f683f-aa48-418d-9beb-3612c63fb361": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d0f683f-aa48-418d-9beb-3612c63fb361", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "84e2bd6c-9410-49c9-ab81-9b2452f294f0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ffee6d1c84996188f7f860fc8e5830c3b66f503a78f5af2c4e77a8e97b904557"}, "3": {"node_id": "af6a5ad8-e2c6-446b-8083-ec40a16fe5f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a9f8ab54bc572addcdd27091ec4372e2662e45cd8da3089d3ce9579d617ff2d8"}}, "hash": "2529879953a8706dad1f0bbc835625c3a6ee5f7f0ab986db01faea0f6b4ad7ce", "text": "The Guard Scorpion fight is a real spectacle, and most of the boss fights across the 40 hour adventure are similarly lavish. It\u2019s not just the battles, though. The interplay between characters is next-level. Everyone is more believable. Each character is distinct and they grow over the course of the story. There\u2019s a tender character moment about midway through that adds more depth to Cloud than was ever possible with the original game\u2019s text boxes - since now emotions can be portrayed wordlessly. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s perfect. Barret is an adorable doofus and a good dad, but he often slips into a Mr. T-style stereotype - he literally says, \u201cQuit your jibber jabber\u201d in fights. Bad. Then there\u2019s Wedge, a fat dude who always talks about food. Also bad. But it mostly stays true to these beloved characters, and new players will likely grow to adore them too. I love little animation touches as well, like how Barret stands with his weight shifted to one side - presumably because one of his arms is a massive gun. Side characters are underbaked, but they have their moments. Early on there are two Shinra troops standing by a gate and you can interact with them to get a handful of different responses. This optional dialogue adds more context to a cutscene that happens later on, rewarding you for your curiosity. It reminds me of that one NPC in the original Midgar whose perspective literally changes as you progress - by the end he realises that he should always look straight ahead so he can have full situational awareness.It\u2019s just lovely. Being with these incredible characters again, combined with the nostalgic music, is almost like a religious experience. Aerith\u2019s theme still stirs something inside me. Exploring the dirty entertainment hub of Wall Market is like stepping through a portal into a childhood dream, though the section you\u2019re looking forward to most here is probably the cheesiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s great, but I wouldn\u2019t have wanted anyone walking in. Thank god we\u2019re in lockdown in the UK, eh? Shame my kids don\u2019t respect me anymore. That\u2019s always been one of the best things about Final Fantasy 7, though - how it fluctuates between serious themes and weirdness. One minute you\u2019re confronting a crime boss who abuses women and the next you\u2019re doing squats with hench gym bros. You can fight a menacing behemoth and summon a giant chicken to help you kick its ass. Characters use the word \u201cmosey\u201d. So, what\u2019s new? Obviously Midgar is now a continuous space, rather than a series of screens you travel between. This means it\u2019s much larger, and there\u2019s spaces between the \u2018screens\u2019. It\u2019s a mostly linear journey, but dungeons are vast - there\u2019s also a bunch of new ones - and hubs are more intricate. These expanded spaces also give the characters more time to bond, with conversations playing over exploration. Again, that wasn\u2019t possible before, since text boxes forced everything to come to a stop for conversations. Relationships now take a front seat. The combat plays out in real-time - you see enemies in the field and it instantly transitions into battle, Cloud pulling the huge sword from his back. Our spiky-haired protagonist has two stances - Operator and Punisher Mode. Operator Mode is for wide swings and damaging multiple enemies while retaining mobility. Punisher Mode turtles you up with the sword facing outwards and allows for more damaging strikes and block counters. You can also bring up a menu to slow time to a crawl as you choose an ability or spell. Every action that isn\u2019t a melee attack, including item use, drains a chunk of your ATB gauge, which you build up by attacking, so you have to juggle between offensive and defensive while keeping your health topped up. Battles are frenetic and exciting. When you master the combat system you\u2019re switching between characters to fire off abilities and combine their damage outputs at just the right time, putting enemies into a \u2018stagger\u2019 status where they\u2019re opened up for more punishment. Each character plays differently, and these differences really shine when you take on some of the endgame challenges in the game\u2019s VR combat simulator - these offer one-on-one duels, and you have to adapt your tactics to suit who you\u2019re controlling.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af6a5ad8-e2c6-446b-8083-ec40a16fe5f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "af6a5ad8-e2c6-446b-8083-ec40a16fe5f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94a74e9a-dab7-4672-9582-ce6779149fa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b4ce4c7fbbcbdca81433d8a294a75ce718865ecab44657a40f495392695e984f"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d0f683f-aa48-418d-9beb-3612c63fb361", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2529879953a8706dad1f0bbc835625c3a6ee5f7f0ab986db01faea0f6b4ad7ce"}, "3": {"node_id": "305ab87e-9655-44c9-b782-f840fc25e50e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c27730f3cdcd6348b6dc7ff53bd46dab4ff77a40be446bc30faff0280d8b283"}}, "hash": "a9f8ab54bc572addcdd27091ec4372e2662e45cd8da3089d3ce9579d617ff2d8", "text": "Magic reappears in the form of materia - gems that can be slotted into weapons and armour to be used in battle as spells or buffs. In a lovely touch, you can physically see them on each character\u2019s weapon. Slotting them also improves your stats, much like how drawing magic in Final Fantasy 8 can buff you up. Then there are linked materia slots, where you can use special materia to heighten the effects of the materia it\u2019s linked with. It makes you feel like a master tactician when you rejig your equipment to get an edge. On top of all that there\u2019s your weapons. Each unlockable weapon has its own upgrade path that\u2019s reminiscent of a simplified version of Final Fantasy 10\u2019s sphere grid - you unlock nodes that provide stat buffs. Some are built around raw power, others are built around magic damage or speed. Each also has an unlockable skill you can master to use with any weapon. All of this together makes character building fluid and flexible. I don\u2019t say this lightly, Final Fantasy 7 Remake has the best combat system in a 3D Final Fantasy game. It\u2019s like a living cutscene. It\u2019s like playable Omnislash. It\u2019s like controlling Advent Children\u2026 if Advent Children had a better story. Not all of the changes are as successful, however. This 40 hour game is based on the first six hours of the original. That means there\u2019s a bunch of filler. Most of the sidequests are like something out of an MMO: you talk to an NPC, they tell you to go kill something. Each hub has five or six of these. Only one of the sidequests led me to an interesting battle, and I had to backtrack through a dungeon to get there. Before release, Square Enix said this remake was built with new players in mind. There\u2019s plenty of nods for fans - wait until you see what they\u2019ve done with one of Final Fantasy 7\u2019s most ridiculous enemies - but there are a bunch of new cutscenes and characters too. This story can be spoiled. Be vigilant. Some of the changes are huge, and not entirely successful. I won\u2019t go into details, but one tweak left me feeling like I\u2019d been conned. And newcomers will likely just have no idea what\u2019s going on. Characters that were fleshed out over the course of the original game feel rushed and without context - it\u2019s like you\u2019re expected to know who they are. It is too meta. While I\u2019m excited for the next game, I felt deflated for an entire day after the credits rolled. But the journey is completely worth it. Midgar is so well-realised, the main characters are wonderfully done, and the battle system is masterful. I can see myself moseying through the entire 40 hours again. At times it felt almost overwhelming to actually be playing it - like Square Enix had made a game specifically for me. I just wish the loyalty to the source material lasted throughout. Despite that, there\u2019s no denying that this is the best Final Fantasy has been in a long time. This game are sick.
