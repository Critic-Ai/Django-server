varieties of space engaged in a hesitant dialogue. On the one hand, there are the wilds of post-nuclear Russia, absurdly splendid, absurdly deadly and moderately open-ended, from dessicated ports where beached tankers jut like dinosaur bones, to ice-locked cities whose sewers have become intestines, clogged with squirming radioactive polyps. Here, you'll act much as you do in other virtual wilderness escapades - trotting to the points of interest you've circled on your paper map, shaking down corpses for crafting resources and avoiding or murdering the many people and things who want to make soup from your thighbones. These are spaces in which life is cheap - cheaper, certainly, than medical kits - and the risk of ambush is unrelenting. Exploring them is a breathless yet resolutely workmanlike experience, in which you'll spend a lot of time crouched in the undergrowth, wondering whether your last three shotgun shells are enough should the bandit upstairs catch sight of your weapon's laser pointer. But running through these vistas is another kind of space, in which other kinds of action - kinder actions, in fact - are possible. This is the mighty steam locomotive that carries protagonist Artyom and his comrades from map to map, as you journey eastward from Moscow's underground in search of a new home. Between lengthy stopovers in each region, usually for the sake of fuel or to deal with obstructive locals, you'll spend an interlude aboard the train - rattling past arid woodlands, poisoned waterways and wilting apartment blocks, in one of 4A's trademark masterstrokes of location design. Each interlude corresponds to a season - Exodus's 20-30 hour campaign spans a year in-game - and it's a joy to watch those variations play out across the train's dented hull, sand caking the engine in the dry salvages of the Caspian Sea, ice brightening the fittings in the depths of winter. You can even walk along the boiler to the prow to watch the miles disappear under your feet, like Leonardo DiCaprio glorying in the view from the Titanic. But the real triumph of the train is that it's a living place, in each sense of the word - a space that evolves during the narrative as carriages are added to serve various plot purposes, and new faces join your ranks. Metro Exodus is, in this regard, both a quest for home and a story about how journeys create their destinations, as you nourish a haven whose greatest strength is that it's utterly transitory, always in motion.What begins as a dingy cabin crowded by rowdy blokes in converted welder masks gradually becomes a little village on wheels. Making my way down to the passenger car I find the squad's amateur guitarist, Stefan, playing a melancholy folk ditty, and Sam, our lone American, fussing over a stewpot in the canteen. To the rear somebody is showing a little girl we rescued how to repair a leather strap, while the train's engineer Krest sneaks a cigarette break behind the toilet. It's reminiscent of BJ's submarine headquarters in Wolfenstein: The New Colossus, though 4A doesn't really need the inspiration - the first two Metro games are stuffed with comparably makeshift and cosy NPC settlements, scraped together from the rubble of Moscow's underground stations. And as in Wolfenstein's submarine, you can exert forms of agency aboard that train - \"verbs\", to lapse into armchair designer parlance - that are seldom available when you disembark. You can mess around with a radio, for one thing, searching for one of Russia's few surviving DJ stations or to eavesdrop on conversations at your next stop. You can share a smoke with the group's cantankerous leader, Colonel Miller, discussing the previous chapter's events (characters often pick up on your choices in each chapter, especially if it involves bloodshed, though none of these substantially change the story's outcome).You can cuddle up on a bunk with Anna - Artyom's wife and the squad's ace sniper, though she's more often found playing the part of damsel in distress. You can escape, in short, from the well-thumbed fantasy of the apocalyptic world as a kind of post-historical firing range, and explore a prospect videogames seldom really investigate - the reforging of connections in society's aftermath, the gentle process of rebirth.All of which may sound rather grandiose, and I shouldn't overstate how far Exodus strays from type.

The weapons are still dirty great handfuls of pipe, wood and wire, and you now have the gratification of clipping them together yourself from scavenged parts - plonking down your backpack to attach and remove scopes, barrels, different magazine sizes and stocks, the effects of which are immediately apparent in the handling. In addition to rifles, shotguns, SMGs and pistols, there's a choice of pneumatic ball-bearing rifle or crossbow as your special weapon. The satisfaction of cranking the former's Super Soaker handle aside, their appeal is that you can craft ammo for them on the go, while bullets, grenades and shells must be manufactured at workbenches that are few and far between. The general scarcity of ammunition makes for more considered gunplay, as does sluggish character movement and the absence of automatic health regen. There are plenty of stretches in which combat can't be avoided - bunkers full of giant spiders, for instance, and a bossfight with a bear large enough to plough through cover - but Artyom is no Master Chief. Given the choice, you'll probably hold fire more often than not, scouting positions through your binoculars, then sneaking around them after sunset with the aid of night vision and motion trackers. I think there's more, however, to this ethos of restraint than the heart-stopping click of an empty chamber. Like many a video game narrative greased by shooting before it, Metro wants you to question the role violence plays in its world. Unlike most such games, it goes about this convincingly.Partly, that's because it isn't really an open world game, however much it might resemble one. There are only two wasteland environments that feel anything like Far Cry; the rest are roomy canyons or winding, scripted corridor encounters in the style of Half-Life. Nor are these maps systematised to the gills, as in the average Ubiworld: there are no territory bars to fill, no thickets of side-mission categories to hack through, no outposts to cleanse and turn into fast travel points. Each region has its spread of optional weapon and gear upgrades, and as in Far Cry 3, you can tag objects of interest through your binoculars, but all of your objectives are bespoke, part of the main plot or a slight departure from it. If the game is to some degree a response to the open world, Metro's borrowings from that genre are as delicate, as thoughtful as the process of dividing up crafting ingredients between ammo and health kits. As such, it stands firm against the open world's propensity for empty, cyclical violence in the name of piecemeal content drops.Beyond that, it's a game in which you'll often leave people alive because they appear to be, well, people, even when bluntly labelled \"THUG\", \"TRIBAL\" or \"BANDIT\" in dialogue, and even - or perhaps especially - when committing obscenities. Metro harbours plenty of anomalous mutants, unhinged sorts and predatory animals who can be gunned down with impunity. The writing can also be very clumsy, not least because Artyom only speaks during (lengthy) load-break voiceovers, which means you sometimes feel like a post-apocalyptic Lassie. \"What's that Artyom? You say Anna's fallen down the hole into the underground biowaste disposal plant?\" But the game's wealth of incidental overheard chatter is good at making you question those dialogue labels, thinking about the grayzone between stranger and enemy. Besides clownish rants about rape and pillage, you'll hear bandits grumble about their leader's decisions, joke about lazy friends, muse about the lives they nearly led, comment on the weather. Far to the east there's a forest tribe who are undergoing an existential crisis about whether killing can be justified in self-defence: while sneaking around their encampment, you'll overhear arguments about whether to actively hunt intruders or just chase them away.

A post-apocalyptic first-person shooter.\nExpect to pay $50/\u00a350\nDeveloper 4A Games\nPublisher Deep Silver\nReviewed on GTX 1080, Intel i5-6600K, 16GB RAM\nMultiplayer None\nLink Official site\nBuy it Epic StoreAfter two games spent in the claustrophobic gloom of the Moscow Metro, it's a strange sensation, at least for a Metro game, to suddenly be staring across a vast, sun-bleached desert. Exodus is a post-apocalyptic road trip through a nuke-blasted Russia, and an arid expanse of what was once the Caspian Sea is one of a number of locations visited by Artyom and his band of survivors. But even with blue skies and the closest thing you can get to clean air in this grim, dead world, survival is still an everyday struggle.I say road trip, but your primary mode of transport in Metro Exodus is an old Soviet-era steam train called the Aurora. The game begins in familiar surroundings\u2014the shattered, radioactive ruins of Moscow and the labyrinth of tunnels beneath it. But it's not long before the Aurora is speeding out of the fallen capital, along the Volga River, and into the wintry countryside. This is your first taste of the open world in Exodus, which is made up of several large, self-contained areas, rather than one continuous sprawl.Metro has always been a rigidly, sometimes suffocatingly linear shooter, but now you have the opportunity to venture off the beaten path, scavenge, and explore. It's a restrained freedom, limited by the size of the maps, but there's something refreshing about an open world that focuses more on detail than size. Every location the Aurora stops at feels wonderfully hand-crafted and the weather, atmosphere, and lighting regularly change as the story spans the seasons, making for an excitingly varied game.Check out our Metro Exodus review and performance test. For handy tips, check out our Metro Exodus weapons guide, weapon upgrade locations, and Metro Exodus crafting guide.\u00a0But this variety extends mainly to the setting and structure. The brutal, kinetic first-person combat and lightweight survival elements that define the Metro games haven't changed in any significant way. Ammo and gas mask filters are still precious commodities, and Artyom still spends the majority of the game in scrappy, tense firefights with other men in gas masks. This means, despite the spectacular change of scenery, it still feels like part of the series. But it also makes Exodus, in some ways, rather disappointing in its lack of ambition.The context, stakes, and location will change, and there are some fantastically dramatic set-pieces to be found in here, but it's a shame how, fundamentally, every encounter in Metro boils down to shooting people. I know it sounds like I'm criticising an FPS for having too much S, but if you're going to give me this big, fascinating, beautiful world to explore, I feel like there should be more interesting ways to interact with it. Sometimes you can approach a situation stealthily, tossing tin cans to distract guards and quietly killing or incapacitating them, but that's about as exotic as it gets.The furiously paced combat can be thrilling, especially when you start modding your guns, transforming puny revolvers into freakish weapons of mass destruction. But whether you're fighting mutants or humans, the AI is never particularly sharp or reactive, and constantly scrabbling for ammo can be a chore. The guns feel great, and I love how you can strip enemy weapons and attach the scavenged parts to your own at a workbench.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4287564c-1b66-4da9-ab60-ef4249f155ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "4287564c-1b66-4da9-ab60-ef4249f155ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0944611-a26b-4c19-b261-b77cfb799ebf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed6bec2a0f344c6039fbacacce2be7c1eb9d53fc01cd0a3a70571edeca8ef6e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "8200667f-0752-48d6-8881-58e69c9c915e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "07bfa4c9ed0eed5dfd0510eebccc0c5250a52fcbceeff98910415f504c480a3a"}}, "hash": "9db621240fc9875f848216afcab891017ca4bb5d221908765893b83d0da214dc", "text": "But the novelty of shooting hordes of crustaceans, bandits, and mutants soon wears off, and after a while I found myself yearning for more depth.A new mutant type, the ridiculously named 'humanimals', are zombie-like drones who rush you in packs, clambering over scenery and occasionally throwing bits of rubble at you. I think they were going for something similar to the creatures in I Am Legend, but they're clumsy, slow, and a drudge to kill, rather than some relentless, savage force to be reckoned with. Most of the mutants are generic, snarling monsters, and quite boring to fight, but there is one towards the end of the game that is actually kind of terrifying.Graphics options Quality (low-extreme), vsync (full/half/off), motion blur (low-high), DirectX version (DX11/DX12), Hairworks (on/off), advanced PhysX (on/off), tessellation (on/off), texture filtering (AF4-AF16), ray tracing (off/high/ultra\u2014requires RTX card), DLSS (on/off\u2014RTX card)\n\nPerformance With a GTX 1080, 16GB of RAM, and an i5-6600K overclocked to 4.0GHz I was able to enjoy Exodus at 1440p/high at a relatively steady 60fps. In really busy areas I'd get a dip to around 50, but it was never enough to spoil the experience.There's also a benchmark utility, and we have a full Metro Exodus performance analysis that goes into more detail. Most people will want to skip ultra quality to maintain decent performance.As for the survival elements, they do add some welcome texture to the game. Even though you've left the Metro, there are still moments where you have to equip your gas mask: radiation leaks, sandstorms, poison gas, and other nasty stuff. And every moment you spend in this toxic air, a timer ticks down, meaning you have to find a steady supply of replacement filters to stay alive. There's crafting too, which makes scouring the world for materials to build ammo and repair your mask and guns an important part of your routine. None of these systems are invasive, however, and the light-touch survival management reinforces the fiction without ever being overbearing.Outside of combat there are some other new features, including the ability to use binoculars. If you climb somewhere high, such as a rusty old crane near the Volga that rattles violently in the wind, you can scan the horizon and zoom in on points of interest, marking them on your map. You won't know what it is until you travel there, which makes for some fun exploration, even if it's usually just more things to shoot at. I do like how each map is littered with stories. Some are relayed through diary entries and tape recordings, but it's the ones told by the environment that are the most vivid: a crashed plane with its skeletal pilot still at the controls, or an abandoned school littered with mouldy textbooks and colourful kids' drawings.There are a few vehicles too, usually reserved for the larger maps, and slightly silly ziplines straight out of a Far Cry game. The weather can change suddenly and there's an ever-shifting day/night cycle, which you can speed up by sleeping at campsites. If you go somewhere at night there may be fewer enemies to deal with, but you could also be harassed by a deadly ball of lightning, which seems to be the Metro equivalent of the anomalies in the STALKER series. But this idea is underdeveloped, and I would have liked to experience more weirdness out there in the wasteland, to make leaving the relative comfort and familiarity of the Metro feel more alien and frightening.What makes Exodus special, and the reason it held my interest all the way to the end despite the weak combat, is the journey. Freed from the dark maze of the Moscow Metro, the environment artists at 4A Games have achieved something remarkable here. From the frozen banks of the Volga to the dried-out Caspian Sea and beyond, the setting is constantly surprising and hauntingly beautiful. We've seen post-nuclear wastelands in a thousand videogames, but there's something about 4A's take on the concept that really creeps under your skin. A subtle air of hopelessness and melancholy that emphasises just how woefully tragic the state of this world is.But by reaching out into the wider world, Metro loses some of its identity. The Moscow Metro, and the weird communities and cultures that developed there after the bombs fell, is one of the most interesting things about the series. Some of what you encounter on the surface in Exodus is just as imaginative, particularly the origins of a strange tribe you encounter in a lush boreal forest.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8200667f-0752-48d6-8881-58e69c9c915e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8200667f-0752-48d6-8881-58e69c9c915e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "4287564c-1b66-4da9-ab60-ef4249f155ab", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9db621240fc9875f848216afcab891017ca4bb5d221908765893b83d0da214dc"}, "3": {"node_id": "a654a514-d6d6-42f8-b5f5-40e44f0034e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d465192f92533f2c4f0ef6f8bd3b2addd8a7a6a2f835374dcf9622355ee78dc"}}, "hash": "07bfa4c9ed0eed5dfd0510eebccc0c5250a52fcbceeff98910415f504c480a3a", "text": "But elsewhere it feels a little like a post-apocalypse by numbers, with shanty towns and bloodthirsty raiders straight out of Mad Max, and a general feeling that you're treading familiar irradiated ground.Metro Exodus also has some problems with storytelling. For one, the English voice acting is, for the most part, terrible. I don't usually mind a bit of amateurish acting in games, but here it's so exaggerated and overdramatic that I actually found it distracting. There is the option to switch to Russian voices, which feels more authentic to the setting, but there's so much crosstalk that keeping track of the subtitles while playing is impractical. And there are too many scenes where you have to stand and wait as people heap big spoonfuls of exposition into your ears, talking interminably about what you're going to do next rather than just letting you, you know, do it.Between major locations you can explore the Aurora as it hurtles along the tracks to its next destination, and it's here where the real heart of the game lies. The overarching plot is enjoyable enough, but it's the interactions between the characters, and how they spend their downtime on the train, that I found the most resonant. You'll see one character serenading another with his guitar; someone looking wistfully out of a window as the scenery rolls by; people telling jokes and shooting the shit in the communal area. The sense of community aboard the Aurora, of family, is palpable\u2014which gives those moments when these mostly likeable characters are in danger added weight.By leaving the tunnels of the Moscow Metro behind, the artists and world-builders at 4A Games have created something pretty incredible here. This voyage through a bleak Russian wasteland, from abandoned cities and burning deserts to autumnal forests and freezing tundras, is full of surprises and stunning scenery. It's just a shame your interaction with this brave new world largely consists of shooting at it. Metro Exodus is, in many ways, a pretty rote FPS attached to a setting that deserves much better. But when the Aurora's brakes screech as it pulls into the next station, the excitement of what lies ahead always makes up for its shortcomings.An incredible trip through a stunning post-apocalyptic world, let down by some uninspiring FPS combat.If it\u2019s set in space, Andy will probably write about it.

It's much more open than previous Metro games and it does have some chunky environments for you to explore, but it is not the same kind of sandbox survival experience as, say, Fallout 4 - and it isn't trying to be. It is, however, fantastic. Metro Exodus blends the survival elements and carefully constructed levels that the Metro series is known for with a dynamic world that's as beautiful as it is dangerous, to stunning results.\u00a0You can see that in action in our video review below.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a654a514-d6d6-42f8-b5f5-40e44f0034e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a654a514-d6d6-42f8-b5f5-40e44f0034e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "8200667f-0752-48d6-8881-58e69c9c915e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "07bfa4c9ed0eed5dfd0510eebccc0c5250a52fcbceeff98910415f504c480a3a"}, "3": {"node_id": "78586fc2-1d2c-4186-979e-eb087b9484e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e95cf86bad21085d31659c37edf7ace514b30805e164ced4f606c9f719521e8d"}}, "hash": "1d465192f92533f2c4f0ef6f8bd3b2addd8a7a6a2f835374dcf9622355ee78dc", "text": "You can see that in action in our video review below.\u00a0Where previous Metro games took place in the titular underground rail system, Metro Exodus takes players to the surface as protagonist Artyom and his fellow Spartan soldiers - including his wife Anna and her father Colonel Miller - chart a course across an irradiated Russia aboard the Aurora locomotive. Their journey starts in spring and stretches into the depths of winter, and each season ushers in a totally new area. The biggest maps in the game, the Volga and the dried-out Caspian Sea, are peppered with side stuff. Contrastingly, the forested, autumnal Taiga feels like a sightseeing tour on a more guided mission. I poked around a few buildings in the Taiga, but I pretty much stuck to the path laid out for me by the main objectives.\u00a0The final wintry area is even more linear and feels much like Metro 2033 - not that that's a point against it. Metro Exodus' story missions present a staggering variety of set pieces - like shooting giant sea slugs from a paddle boat, mowing down mutant spiders in an underground bunker, or fleeing from a pack of wolves through a dimly lit forest - and they introduce new enemies and characters at a healthy pace. The open-world activities and the structured missions also flow together surprisingly well. One mission required me to ride some railroad machinery through a bandit camp, and I was delighted to find it was the same camp I cleared out while exploring the area earlier. It's impressive how well the traditional missions hold up considering how fleshed-out the larger environments are.\u00a0That said, for me the Caspian Sea and the Volga were the high points of the game. As you'd expect from a tundra and a desert, they play very differently. The icy Volga is stalked by dog-like Watchers, giant carnivorous shrimp, and all manner of ghouls, whereas the sandy Caspian Sea features enormous bats called gargoyles, packs of oversized mole rats, and some of the scariest spiders to ever scurry in the dark. The human inhabitants are wildly different, too. The post-war acolytes of the Volga equate technology to Satan and are none too fond of you, but power-hungry slavers rule the Caspian Sea. They feel like totally different worlds, and they're both filled with fun things to do and interesting characters to meet.\u00a0Main objectives and some optional ones are automatically marked on the map, but there are also plenty of surprises hidden in Metro Exodus. I have fond memories of running into a talkative hermit in the bowels of a spider-infested shipwreck, for example. And even when things are marked for me, I enjoy deciding how and when to handle them.\u00a0Metro Exodus can hold its own with the 25 best FPS games of all time\u00a0Sure, I could immediately head for the passenger train car we need to continue our journey, but those mutant-infested ruins are on the way there. Oh, and I may as well scope out that safehouse in the distance - the last one I found was loaded with supplies and located right next to a new gizmo for my kit. I also managed to scrounge up enough scrap metal to craft some more shotgun shells, and I desperately need to clean my guns and repair my gas mask, so I should plop down at a crafting bench while I'm there. Come to think of it, mutants are more active at night, so I'll avail myself to the safehouse bed and wait for sunrise. Wouldn't want to waste bullets.\u00a0The combat itself is a varied mix of rock-solid gunplay and tense stealth missions, and I enjoyed both sides. I went with the tried-and-true Dishonored approach: go in stealthily whenever possible, but open fire when stealth is too much of a hassle. Metro Exodus does stealth pretty well - which is to say, it doesn't instantly go to hell the second one guard spots your big toe - but what can I say, I can only load a checkpoint so many times before my trigger finger gets itchy. At the same time, there's nothing quite like chewing through a horde of mutants with a freshly upgraded shotgun.\u00a0Speaking of which, while the weapon upgrade system is incredibly simple and largely driven by the guns you recover from downed enemies rather than components found while exploring, it works well with Metro's formula. I'm basically just using whatever weapon part gives the best stats, but it's still fun to improve my arsenal. I'd say the same for the general crafting system used for medkits, ammo, mask filters, and other handy items. This system is fueled by what I've dubbed scrap materials and science materials, which can be found all over the place.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78586fc2-1d2c-4186-979e-eb087b9484e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "78586fc2-1d2c-4186-979e-eb087b9484e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "a654a514-d6d6-42f8-b5f5-40e44f0034e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1d465192f92533f2c4f0ef6f8bd3b2addd8a7a6a2f835374dcf9622355ee78dc"}, "3": {"node_id": "f714ffa1-51b2-43b7-a2e4-d71ca28d6ed1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0a557a44623efa0e5886781a0fffad1f2d993819ef147bcccf9539f95f76d65a"}}, "hash": "e95cf86bad21085d31659c37edf7ace514b30805e164ced4f606c9f719521e8d", "text": "Again, it's a simple system but it gets the job done.\u00a0\"I can see the change I bring to the world and it feels like my actions matter\"Keeping up with all this crafting stuff - on top of charging my flashlight, cleaning my guns to keep them from jamming, and monitoring the local radiation levels - lends a tremendous sense of immersion to Metro Exodus. After my first long play session, I stood up from my computer, noticed it had gotten dark out, and felt a very real urge to charge the flashlight that I, Austin Wood, who is distinctly not Artyom, don't actually own in real life. I haven't been able to laugh at myself for stupidly thinking to do some in-game stuff in real life in ages. Not many games draw me in like that.\u00a0Scavenging for supplies, upgrading and maintaining my gear, and ticking off items on the to-do list I set for myself never got old in the 20 hours it took me to beat Metro Exodus on normal difficulty. I love how responsive its world is, how organic it feels. The nuclear war that started all this essentially reset humanity, and it's fascinating to see how people in different regions choose to live in this new, ruined world. There's no shortage of madmen, but there are also people with actual morals, and it is so nice to play a post-apocalyptic shooter where everyone I meet isn't a stupid bandit wearing half a bear and most of a lawnmower.\u00a0When I lower my weapon before approaching a group of survivors, they thank me for my show of peace. When I go out of my way to retrieve a souvenir for one of the Aurora's members, they're visibly overjoyed - as I am when I later see them using it in the Aurora's passenger car. When I put other survivors ahead of my immediate mission, Anna thanks me for my kindness. I can see the change I bring to the world and it feels like my actions matter. It also helps that the game is a joy just to be in. Gone are the days of snow and steel. Welcome to a new, prettier Metro.\u00a0After spending two games in tunnels, the jump to the open environments of Metro Exodus is a refreshing change - and for Artyom and the gang, it's a daunting one. Not long ago, they were convinced the surface was uninhabitable, yet here they are chasing the horizon by the seat of their pants. They don't even know what the world is like nowadays, let alone what they want to do in it. They need information and a place to settle, and they're constantly running low on supplies. Their journey takes them through the best and worst the world has to offer, and by god does it have a lot to offer. Metro Exodus is at once comfortingly familiar and a massive step forward for the series, both in terms of how it plays and how it tells its stories. It's not only the best Metro game yet, it's one of the best shooters I've played in years.\u00a0Reviewed on a PC running an i5-3570k @ 4.2ghz, 16GB RAM, and a GeForce GTX 1070.\u00a0Austin freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree, and he's been with GamesRadar+ since 2019.

The misery and hopelessness of the situation doesn\u2019t always come into it, but you could never accuse the Metro series of shying away from the full implication of nuclear Armageddon.Based on a series of novels by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, the first two Metro games (remastered a while back as double pack Metro Redux) were set in and around the Moscow metro system, where a small group of Muscovites have survived the outbreak of World War III and try to make a life in the tunnels while avoiding the nuclear fallout and lethal mutants above.The original games were primarily linear first person shooters, but with a heady mixture of other gameplay styles including stealth and survival horror. They also had an impressively ambitious story (also written by Glukhovsky) that used the setting to meditate on humanity\u2019s propensity for conflict no matter the situation, as the survivors gravitated towards the authoritarian extremes of communism and fascism and absolutely fail to learn the lessons that caused their situation in the first place.Despite a wide span of obvious video game influences, including Half-Life 2 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow Of Chernobyl, the Metro titles have a very distinct tone that is very much their own. The scarcity of ammunition, and the need to craft your own, adds a light survival aspect and while there are no stats or dialogue choices the strong narrative drive and exploration also tempts comparison with action role-playing games. The key difference between Exodus and the previous games though is that the new game includes of a number of open world areas, moving between those and more linear sections as the story dictates.As interesting as the previous games\u2019 stories have been in terms of their allegory of Russian society \u2013 and ultimately human society as a whole \u2013 the storytelling often got a little muddled and relied too much on familiarity with the novels and reading every little note scattered about the game world. Exodus is a direct sequel to both the games and the novels but has a much more straightforward narrative, that requires no previous knowledge of the franchise.You play as an elite solder named Artyom, who has become obsessed with the idea that there are other survivors outside of the metro \u2013 despite all evidence to the contrary. Set 23 years after the initial missile strikes the landscape around Moscow is less dangerous, or at least less radioactive, than the previous games and it soon becomes clear that Artyom is right and he and his team of soldiers, plus his wife Anna, end up commandeering a train that takes them east across the country. The story spans a whole year in game time, starting off in the Moscow winter and taking in a wide variety of other landscapes, from desert to forest.With the constant changes of season and location the segue between linear and non-linear maps works very well, with the latter filled with secondary objectives and rewarding exploration. Like Fallout, you\u2019re constantly on the eye out for resources to collect, but you can craft basic ball-bearing bullets and other perishables on the go from your backpack, as well as reconfigure your gun on the fly. This helps foster a great feeling of freedom as you\u2019re given a minimum amount of instruction on what to do, with the game relying on clever signposting more than following the Rockstar route of prescribed instructions.The open worlds feature a proper day/night cycle and dynamic weather, so it\u2019s often best to wait until night if you\u2019re facing human adversaries, who might be asleep or unable to see as well in the dark, but at the risk of certain mutant animals being more active. There\u2019s a well-established ecosystem at work, as you watch predators attack and eat prey animals, or call in reinforcements (in what is clearly a nod to Jurassic Park\u2019s velociraptors) if one of their scouts spots you.Even with the ammo limitations it is possible to play Metro Exodus as a straight shooter, but we found it far more rewarding to use stealth. As with the previous games the weapons are jury-rigged antiques and although the gunplay is a little better than before they\u2019re still not that much fun to use, and that seems to be entirely purposeful. The artificial intelligence is noticeably better though and stalking enemies from the shadows is very rewarding, especially as each map is riddled with secret crawlspaces and shortcuts if you take the time to search for them.Although there are some more arcade-like sections (a grisly encounter in a nuclear bunker being one early highlight) Metro Exodus is a naturally slow-paced game and all the better for it.

Most of the low level schlubs you fight are just doing their job and you have the option of merely knocking them out when you surprise them. They\u2019ll even give up and beg for mercy if they realise they\u2019re the last man standing.Not only is this vastly more realistic than most other games but the other characters recognise whether you\u2019re being merciful or not and this can significantly affect subsequent encounters and how you as a character are perceived. A good argument could be made that the game should\u2019ve provided dialogue choices and a voice for Artyom (although he does narrate the loading sequences) but as with all its gameplay elements Metro Exodus prefers to keep the mechanics as simple and accessible as possible.The end result is a game that feels considerably more mature and meaningful than other post-apocalyptic titles. And yet the atmosphere is not quite so cripplingly depressing as the previous entries. It offers a damning indictment of humanity\u2019s willingness to follow orders simply out of a sense of purpose and belonging, but there is a sliver of optimism present in the story and characters that was not so evident before.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakTop 10 new Halloween board games and tabletop RPGs 2023What flaws there are mostly centre around the slightly scrappy presentation, with horribly long load times, minor graphical glitches, and an occasional penchant for instantkill deaths that seem to come out of nowhere. On balance though these are fairly trivial concerns and the graphics are astoundingly good for a game whose budget is undoubtedly many tiers below that of rival titles from much bigger companies.Easily the best of the Metro series, Exodus promotes the franchise into the top flight of action adventures with a blend of genre influences that combine to create an impressively unique experience. It\u2019s the best post-apocalyptic adventure this generation and proof that it\u2019s not how familiar an idea is that\u2019s important but how well you pull it off.In Short: The best post-apocalyptic survival game of the generation, that innovates in terms of both its varied gameplay mechanics and its incisive storytelling.Pros: The mix of linear and open world areas works very well, with constant rewards for exploration and experimentation. Organic morality system and thought-provoking script. Great graphics.Cons: Even if that\u2019s half the point, the guns still aren\u2019t much fun to use.

But over the course of two critically acclaimed games and a well-executed redux collection, it has steadily gained an audience appreciative of its dynamic gameplay, grounded storytelling, and gripping tension. Developer 4A Games aims to step out of the shadows of cult fandom and challenge for mainstream acceptance with Metro Exodus, taking the action out of the cramped underground and into the irradiated Russian landscape. With a gorgeously realized world and a well-paced campaign, Exodus makes a compelling case for that acceptance, even though some anachronisms keep the story from realizing its full potential.\u00a0Artyom and crew have left the Metro in search of a better life, and each stop along the voyage offers a new territory to explore, from the flooded flatlands of the Volga River to the dried and dusty former waterfront of the Caspian Sea. Metro Exodus isn\u2019t an open world, but rather a series of defined sandboxes that allow players freedom to go where they want and tackle objectives at their own pace. 4A Games\u2019 technical prowess is on full display in these dynamic play spaces, with gorgeous lighting illuminating the impressive landscapes. The variety of environments and seasons keep the game feeling fresh throughout the roughly 25-hour campaign, delivering new factions to battle and new mutated beasts to fight or flee. The trip occasionally deviates from open areas in favor of a more straightforward mission that recalls the level design of its predecessors. Metro Exodus\u2019 greatest triumph is this well-tuned pacing; no region overstays its welcome, and all have interesting places to explore and memorable characters to meet.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a498cd46-a9ce-4f3f-bd88-21cd918b48c4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a498cd46-a9ce-4f3f-bd88-21cd918b48c4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "0adacc87-608f-4e34-b651-b031c84bd150", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "405cab56288dcb9f36d069d334c0fef8b04d18899b7b53aef2b143362fd1d5a3"}, "3": {"node_id": "910b7a68-0290-401a-90cb-f8bd03b398b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fca5db8af611ba8a450a96f01a26e093cc21d5fa027c05958b03df99036b486f"}}, "hash": "a71816ff5e45af468763f4882cdf21a1851d241eff9f235aa958f68254cf6852", "text": "The suffocating atmosphere and supernatural occurrences that pervaded your every action in the previous games are sparser this time around, but each region has its own foreboding locations where the jump scares and dread reside.4A Games has always held storytelling in high regard, and that emphasis continues here. If the previous two games were influenced primarily by Half-Life, Exodus takes its narrative cues from MachineGames\u2019 recent Wolfenstein titles \u2013 almost to a fault. In between missions, you spend time aboard the Aurora locomotive hanging around your compatriots, gaining insight into their personalities and motivations. Some characters are unique, but others feel eerily familiar \u2013 the handyman Tokarev and love interest Anna bear an uncanny resemblance to Wolfenstein's Set Roth and Anya, respectively. Your friends suffer sicknesses, celebrate marriages, express unshakeable hope, and occasionally succumb to despair throughout your journey, bringing everyone closer together. The ending is bittersweet, but the journey is what leaves the biggest impression.I applaud the attempt to bring more depth to these characters and the world, but the emotional impact of the story\u2019s most dramatic moments is often undermined by wooden voice performances. At times, the actors sound like they are listlessly reading words off a script. The lack of back and forth between Artyom and his crew also robs the scenes of their intended weight. Artyom has always been the strong and silent type, but these conversations feel awkward given the length at which many of these characters speak to him with no response whatsoever. When his wife Anna struggles to come to grips with the moral complexity of a situation the crew just extracted itself from, his silence feels downright perplexing. \u00a0Artyom may be a terrible conversationalist, but he\u2019s a capable guerrilla fighter. As with the previous games, most of the time Exodus allows you to approach combat scenarios however you like. Attacking at night with a stealth approach lets you avoid wanton bloodshed, which can alter the outcome of your interactions with the various factions and determine the fate of certain sidekicks. If you prefer to shoot first and ask questions later, you have that option as well. Combat awards precision and punishes firing wildly, which I appreciate. The variety of weapons and their accompanying attachments also give you a lot of flexibility on the battlefield and encourages experimentation; I frequently tweaked my loadout on the fly to try new configurations. If Artyom has a limitation, it\u2019s his traversal skills. His movements are slow and cumbersome when climbing, and the logic of what he can and can\u2019t vault is inconsistent.Exploring every point of interest is the best way to find new attachments and critical upgrades to your equipment. Resources have never been overflowing in the Metro series, but you won\u2019t run out of ammo or med packs too often in Exodus if you thoroughly scavenge, a change that should appeal to action-hungry run-and-gunners. Those who crave the challenging attrition of the previous games should turn up the difficulty before beginning the campaign. The removal of the previous games\u2019 bullet economy takes away a lot of the tension of managing resources, but certain segments of the game still make you count your bullets.Metro Exodus largely succeeds in its ambitions. The freeform sandboxes give players more agency to play how they want to play, and the smart level design and well-tuned pacing keep the experience feeling fresh throughout the campaign. The story may suffer from weak acting and 4A\u2019s decision to keep Artyom a silent protagonist, but these shortcomings don\u2019t stop me from recommending the game to both newcomers and series fans.\n\u00a0\nView the discussion thread.\nFor regular updates on the biggest news and reviews in gaming delivered to your inbox every week:Sign up now!\u00a9 1991 to  Game Informer. All Rights Reserved.\nPolygon, Filed under:A franchise built on darkness now flirts with optimism and hopeThe Metro series so far has been defined by its claustrophobic setting and worldview. After nuclear war ravages Moscow in 2013, survivors who flee to the underground tunnels of the Metro system form their own independent states and societies, all in a bid to keep on living. That element of survival against the odds in a dangerous environment, rarely going outside into the irradiated city ruins, is inseparable from the franchise.

To leap out of its confines and into that unknown world feels like jumping into a space cruiser and departing the planet earth. Aptly named the Aurora by its crew, the train becomes your ship \u00e0 la the Normandy in Mass Effect. The locations you visit, varied in their look and feel, become planets.As I explore unique and visually captivating miniature open worlds that constitute the \u201clevels\u201d of Metro Exodus, my train becomes a place of refuge. Between locations, I can roam about its carriages, catch up with its crewmates, maintain my gear, and partake in little activities like playing the guitar or smoking newspaper cigarettes. It\u2019s functionally and aesthetically a train. But it takes on a mood unexpected of the franchise\u2019s genre: warm, relaxed, and nonviolent. 4A Games took this opportunity to explore a range of different post-apocalyptic environments that move with the seasons over the game\u2019s yearlong timeline. The Volga River is a swampland home to villagers who worship a giant mutated shrimp. The Caspian Sea is a lake dried out into a desert. It operates under the tyrannical thumb of a Mad Max-style oil baron and his legion of thugs roaming the wastes in shoddily repaired cars and trucks. Taiga is a lush forest region home to an unusual tribe and beasts.The world isn\u2019t fully open, but compared to the corridors of the metro, it isn\u2019t linear either. I\u2019m given plenty of approaches to the different encounters I run into. One mission has Artyom and some of his squad infiltrate a dock to steal a tugboat. You could stealthily approach the building on foot, or you could ascend a nearby radio tower occupied by bandits and use the zipline at its peak to reach the rendezvous location in a speedier (and cooler) fashion.The weapons are weighty and powerful. They collect dirt as you traverse through dust and mud and require cleaning at workbenches, but it never feels tedious. Moreover, this need for maintenance coupled with the plethora of attachments you use to customize them gives every gun a sense of ownership. This is my Kalash: There are many like it, but this one is mine.There\u2019s a lot of busy work like this in Metro Exodus. Much like my guns, my gas mask can get dirty, and I have to wipe it clean if it becomes difficult to see. I have to replace its filters as they start to deteriorate, lest I choke on the toxic air in pockets of radioactivity. But it never feels like work. It\u2019s organic, and eventually it becomes second nature. I find myself taking all of these factors into account when interacting with the world: Is there a lot of mud here? I\u2019ll be sure not to sprint through it, kicking up dirt onto all of my equipment. Am I about to head down into a little bunker? I\u2019d best make sure to craft some more air filters, in case I end up needing them.Accessibility options are somewhat limited but nonetheless present. For QTEs, there are the choices of rapid tapping, holding down, or just pressing the required button. Subtitles also come with a few different options: changing their size; toggling the speaker, background, and sign subtitles; and deciding whether lines of dialogue are labeled with the character that says them.While it isn\u2019t an option in the accessibility menu, hit markers give a lot of feedback. If a shot makes contact, the marker flashes white, and upon killing an opponent, it flashes red. This is helpful in some particularly messy gunfights, and also adds to the satisfaction factor. What doesn\u2019t add to the satisfaction factor is the occasional stretchy-armed ragdoll of a bandit I\u2019ve just killed, or the sudden disappearance of an ally mid-conversation, only for them to return once I reload a quick save. Fortunately, these incidents are so few and far between that they don\u2019t impact my experience in any extreme way.What is Metro Exodus setting out to achieve in the world that it has created?

We still see the monstrosity of humanity, the horrors of brutal survival. But that isn\u2019t the dominant worldview here. Metro Exodus injects the Russian post-apocalypse with hope.Between two locations, as we cruise along the railway passing green valleys and distant mountaintops, I join my comrades in the kitchen of the passenger carriage to drink, laugh, and play music together. We joke about one crewmate\u2019s obsession with women, cough and wheeze at the strength of the booze, and toast again and again over what lies in the future for us. I don\u2019t need to participate in this. Within the confines of the game, it\u2019s completely optional. But in a world destroyed by war and violence, pure and innocent moments like this are captivating.Without saying too much, the buildup to Metro Exodus\u2019 climax does become a little dire. But even then, that desperation is born of optimism. Throughout the game, I run into a series of moral choices that are unclear in their impact, and even in their actual morality. I lose friends, for better and for worse, and my actions have consequences on the communities that I meet. But that faith in a better tomorrow still lingers, never fading away. It\u2019s refreshing.There have always been shades of gray in the Metro franchise, but until now the darker shades dominated its emotional and moral landscapes.

It's a sensible change in setting that broadens Metro's horizons, though it sometimes loses the focus the series is known for. Still, the firefights and stealth deliver a familiar and incredible tension, complemented by streamlined survival mechanics necessary to face terrifying threats. But with Artyom and friends punching a one-way train ticket in hopes of greener pastures, Metro Exodus becomes a journey more about the enduring relationships and ties that bind an earnest crew of survivors.In the opening hours, returning protagonist Artyom is shown with a tenacious insistence that human life exists outside the metro. It gets him into serious trouble, and it's further revealed that a larger conspiracy is at play. Your departure seems all too sudden and a bit of a disservice to the hardships endured in the previous games, but the heat of the moment and gut instincts of your companions help ease you into the premise of a year-long expedition to wherever the railroads lead.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterNow Playing: Metro Exodus Quick Video ReviewThus, Metro Exodus takes the franchise in a bold direction by having a few significant chapters dedicated to open sandbox-style environments where you're free to roam, explore non-critical points of interest, and follow the main story path. Exploration tends to not be a reward in itself as these open areas are sparse and struggle to incentivize you to venture far off. Doing so pits you against mutants that force you to expend valuable resources for very little in return. Navigating isn't entirely enjoyable whether it be because of the sluggish rowboats in the Volga or empty lands of the Caspian. It sometimes feels as if Metro's methodical movement was thrown into much larger spaces it wasn't meant for.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0a01997f-d477-499b-8379-b121cdec7c21": {"__data__": {"id_": "0a01997f-d477-499b-8379-b121cdec7c21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c2c16d0-51bd-47c6-85a1-be1dda2ce6ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8c01e3a6b12256c48887f80d4606bade95e7798899afe0ad0da92515212eb36f"}, "3": {"node_id": "c9982ede-4948-4a46-b776-7795dd6c7238", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3c57c2b004e07575742e6b1745d10939e18cfb8d275e0771dfd71617e8a5bd3"}}, "hash": "dcd45163458579da6353ee13f803d85f8e31b5ae5bd15026d3071009f110c05f", "text": "Thankfully, the game reins it in for its other chapters, especially when you make it to the lush forest of the Taiga that masterfully guides you to and from open areas and confined spaces at a tempered pace.During your time in the open areas, optional side quests will organically populate your map by way of environmental hints or characters mentioning a point of interest in dialogue. These aren\u2019t traditional side quests that get logged into a checklist; instead, they're opportunities to experience more of Metro\u2019s tense combat scenarios and lead to potentially finding new equipment, scavenging additional resources, or extracting smaller stories that feed into the bigger picture.Despite the addition of open environments, Exodus primarily plays similarly to previous games, and for the majority of the time it channels the series existing strengths. Carefully laid out levels strike a balance between freedom of approach and linear, focused paths to objectives when you face human enemies, creating a fine flow within missions. Sure, some guards will have their backs conveniently turned or make silly moves in combat, but the overarching thrill that you can swiftly kill or be killed lingers. Another Metro staple of fighting mutated beasts delivers a different style of tension. Irradiated spiders, nimble mutants, and lurking amphibians strike fear as you brace for their attack in ravaged pitch-dark corridors and flooded buildings. Even the harmless spiders that crawl on your arm and across your face further build a terrifying atmosphere. It's a state of vulnerability covered in a layer of dread that Metro gets right yet again.Hardly do you ever feel either unfairly disadvantaged or overpowered, as weapons fire with impact and can be a challenge to handle. Each firearm has a roster of modifications that you'll scavenge from enemy weapons--sights, scopes, barrels, loading mechanisms--which give you control of how you want to fight. This wide variety of customization options can turn a dinky revolver into a formidable long-range weapon or a janky Kalashnikov into a devastating assault rifle--it's a satisfying system that gives gunplay an additional layer of depth. Modding can also be done using your backpack at any time, giving you the chance to adapt to situations as they arise.Workbenches and your backpack are saving graces in Metro Exodus, since there are no longer any shops to buy equipment and items. Gone is the clever system of trading in military-grade bullets for critical items; in its place is a crafting system that's both manageable and fitting for the survivalist mentality Exodus instills. You'll accumulate scrap metal and chemicals to craft medkits, filters, and ammo, and maintain weapon condition. Even when you're juggling systems such as keeping your flashlight charged and changing out gasmask filters, it never becomes overbearing and adds an enjoyable challenge of gear management even as you're fending off foes throughout.For the most part, Metro Exodus does away with the supernatural by leaving the clairvoyant Dark Ones in the past. In venturing into the unknown, the game tends to rely on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes. You have the cultists who've brainwashed locals to shun technology, a society of cannibals who put up an orderly front, and slavers who exploit and abuse others. But Exodus uses them to lay the groundwork for its better moments between characters and the struggles they endure. And despite the story being less centered around Artyom--who oddly remains a silent protagonist outside of loading screen monologues--Exodus unfolds in a much more personal fashion. The broader examinations of humanity and psychological twists have been dialed back to make room for a more grounded story about the necessary sacrifices you make for the ones you love.These characters are brought to life with an impressive amount of dialogue that seems to go on forever, but because the moments of levity have a degree of charm and earnestness, you\u2019ll want to stay and listen.The best parts of the story are found in chapters between the action where you simply hang out aboard the Aurora, the train that functions as headquarters. Here you have the chance to tune the radio to eavesdrop on transmissions that play off of in-game events or listen to some sweet tunes, but more importantly, it's your opportunity to unravel the endearing personalities that make up your crew. These characters are brought to life with an impressive amount of dialogue that seems to go on forever, but because the moments of levity have a degree of charm and earnestness, you\u2019ll want to stay and listen. It's not without a few lines that feel contextually out of place, though the natural flow of dialogue and interactions between the team communicates just as much about them as the stories they tell.Anna shares her thoughts about the life she hopes to build with you as she rests her head on your lap.

And Miller is the hardened leader exemplifying the tough love of a father figure who wants the best for you and his daughter Anna. These are just a few of the characters that represent the best in Metro Exodus' narrative.The exact narrative threads can change, however; Metro's morality system makes a return, subtly judging your actions without explicitly revealing itself. What's important is that it doesn't always force you into a non-lethal approach; if you want to cut the throats of the heartless slavers or take a shotgun to a cannibal's head, by all means do so, and as long as you don't hurt the innocent, you're in the clear. And with a keen eye or sharp ear, you may also come across unexpected events that'll pay off depending on your course of action. Consequences don't make themselves immediately apparent, but can lead to fascinating results as the story progresses.It's worth noting that technical issues are strewn throughout Metro Exodus. In one playthrough (pre-day one patch), I've fallen through the game world just after an auto-save, inexplicably lost upgraded equipment I couldn't get back at a workbench, and had some rare, but noticeable framerate drops at modest settings with a fairly high-end PC. They didn't break the game, but can frustrate and negate hard-earned progress. In the few hours spent with the PS4 version, the game was stable, and as expected it ran on a lower framerate than a capable PC. It's not always a smooth ride, though it doesn't take away from the gripping journey that the game takes you on.You may miss the mystery and intrigue of the previous games, but Exodus puts together a charismatic crew of friends and family that you'll want to follow to the ends of the earth.At first glance, Metro Exodus gives you that wide-open, free, and dangerous world unbound by tunnels, though the scope of its tale focuses on what drives you personally and the lengths you're willing to go to protect what matters most. The open sandboxes may not be strongest addition, but the game still embraces the sense of vulnerability and post-apocalyptic terror alongside impactful weapons used in refined combat and stealth scenarios.

Three more follow. I rise to fire my rifle. It jams. I feel frightened, vulnerable, out of sorts. But also, at home, like I\u2019ve stumbled into a lucid dream shared by Far Cry 2, STALKER, and of course, Metro 2033.I\u2019m on a train\u2014our train\u2014surrounded by friends. Family. I can overhear their conversations as sun glints through lightly fogged windows and the train clacks down the tracks. Laughter. Stories. Boasts. Hopes. I sit down in a cramped cart with our heavy weapons specialist Stepan and a nurse we rescued named Katya. Stepan is playing guitar. I pick up another and join him. Together, we add to the gentle cacophony.I can hear each stair creak as I ascend the lair of a \u201cgargoyle\u201d mutant. \u201cThis is suicide,\u201d I think, but I keep going. A little girl asked me to retrieve her teddy bear. I\u2019m going to do it. I reach the gargoyle\u2019s nest. It\u2019s curled up, asleep beneath a moonless sky. The teddy bear is in its nest. I shuffle toward it and reach out a trembling hand. The creature stirs and lashes out twice. Blood masks my face, clouds my vision. Teddy bear in hand, I bolt. I see a zipline. I latch onto it and soar away from the gargoyle, turning back to make sure it\u2019s not flying after me. I finally start breathing again as I land hundreds of feet away. \u201cFuck you,\u201d I say to the teddy bear.I\u2019m surrounded by darkness. If the cramped ventilation system I\u2019m squeezing through stays dark for another few seconds, I\u2019m dead meat. Mutant spiders chitter and screech, out of sight but definitely not out of mind.

Many of them are young and desperate, taken in and enslaved by a ruthless and charismatic leader. He asks me not to kill them as I stalk through their lair. He asks me to understand.Metro Exodus is a series of moments, a blur of sometimes nearly-incoherent events that pass like scenery outside the window of a fast-moving train. You pick out a few, but others fly by so indistinctly that you\u2019ve forgotten them minutes later. It\u2019s a bounteous bouquet of first-person shooter ideas, encompassing everything from modern open-world level design to hyper-linear scripted set pieces to walking simulators, one right after another. But the game struggles to cohere. It\u2019s inconsistent, frustrating, and frequently less than the sum of its parts. The moments I wrote about above, I remember with perfect clarity. But I\u2019m already struggling to remember many others\u2014strung together, as they were, by a post-apocalyptic clich\u00e9-heavy plot, factions that never quite click, and missions that introduce extra characters to an already bloated cast instead of giving the spotlight to crucial ones. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t tell you much about half the characters that traveled with me, even after listening to them talk at me for literal hours.Exodus is far more structurally ambitious than previous games in the Metro series, both of which were linear adventures confined to post-apocalyptic train tunnels. This time around, main character Artyom and friends are done tussling with Nazis and monsters in tunnels. Now they\u2019re topside in the remains of a world they were certain no longer existed. As a result, you divide your time between exploring areas that are either open or linear, depending on what the story calls for, and hanging out with your pals back on the train.Many of the moments, environments, and atmospheres Exodus creates shine even as they\u2019re surrounded by a world of despair and decay. The game visits a veritable greatest-hits album of post-apocalyptic settings while managing to maintain a unique feel and atmosphere. No small feat, given how many other shooters have already visited the end of the world.

Often, they behave less like enemies and more like hazards: If you don\u2019t get too close, they\u2019ll go on living their lives. Sometimes they even fight each other. Multi-layered, almost Thief-like sound design clues you in to their relative locations, with snarls, cries, and lengthy bandit conversations creating a feeling of constant tension.At the start of the game, I felt like I was near the bottom of the food chain.

I had precious few bullets to spare, so I crept through half-dead bushes and underbrush instead of trying to play hot-shit hotshot against packs of mutants who a) wouldn\u2019t give me any supplies and b) were imminently capable of tearing me limb from limb. Brief moments of empowerment\u2014mostly involving stealthing my way through bandit lairs and freeing those they\u2019d captured or enslaved\u2014felt like triumphs. But beyond the reaches of those flimsy, man-made tents and walls, the wasteland was still waiting to pounce.This was Exodus at its best. However, it repeatedly proved capable of suddenly flipping over and exposing its ugly underbelly, like a screaming spider freak mutant exposed to too much light. As I said in my impressions after 30 hours with the game last week:Yep, the Metro series\u2019 trademark jank is back, and in many places, it threatens to be the game\u2019s downfall. Exodus is admirably ambitious, blending countless mission types, combat variables, and a series of locales that seriously feel like they could each be from a different game, but AI and other systems struggle to keep up. Enemy AI has improved by leaps and bounds since Last Light, but it still alternates between being eagle-eyed and comically blind to your presence. This became especially apparent to me when I reached the game\u2019s second area: a vast, lonely desert. Open areas lead to wildly inconsistent behavior from AI, and missions became too sprawling for their own good, creating confusion about where I needed to go. I\u2019ve also encountered quite a few bugs, both hilarious (a bandit moonwalking through the sky) and frustrating (the climactic end of an act-concluding main quest broke, forcing me to reload repeatedly until it magically worked again).Combined, these issues have formed a handy crafting recipe for frustrating tedium. I won\u2019t beat around the glowing green bush: I\u2019ve spent multiple hours of my time with Exodus absolutely infuriated.Having finished it, I can now say that Exodus is one of the most inconsistent games I\u2019ve played in years. It\u2019s a masterclass of care and craft in places, a post-apocalyptic world in which detail and humanity trump scope for scope\u2019s sake and Fallout-style ironic distance from the subject matter. The story is smarter than it initially seems to be; while factions like an electricity-fearing cult and Mad Max ripoff bandits aren\u2019t inherently clever, the game\u2019s treatment of them is. At almost every turn, your travel companions urge you to understand where these people are coming from, and to avoid bloodshed if you can. In almost every case, it\u2019s possible to do so, too. Exodus is the video game equivalent of that friend who cares so much about everything all the time, who wears their bleeding heart on their sleeve and outshines the sun with their earnestness. You can\u2019t help but root for it. That makes it all the more depressing, however, when it stumbles with bugs, AI issues, a bloated cast, a story that lags woefully far behind excellent world-building, and bits of needlessly frustrating level design.Exodus isn\u2019t content to just be one kind of first-person shooter. After an open first half focused on survival and exploration, the  latter portion plays much more like its linear predecessors, to mixed results.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8261b8f8-36a0-4fab-b0ca-8b05c94f8656": {"__data__": {"id_": "8261b8f8-36a0-4fab-b0ca-8b05c94f8656", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "e45832b9-5aec-45ba-829c-a1f2d0682498", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e262b38d11e7dd273966f6a3ed937dcbc322efe44e8bb4b3a2dedd7e2d66f7ab"}, "3": {"node_id": "331671b5-a769-4222-a7e0-246814826f04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "085d49cb9db91a824eebe3db19882e07fd311236d6ae668d44a418168fb8bd97"}}, "hash": "9587d937401d686a63d850db716d36ee704e105c9cdf073c95196acbf8816d97", "text": "The final two of Exodus\u2019 four major locations suffer from their own particular issues, as well as more exasperating versions of issues that pop up all throughout the rest of the game. The third, a forested fall setting, starts out on a high note, dropping you into a mysterious village armed with nothing but a crossbow. I loved sneaking through that area and into a more open forest that was bathed in eerie moonlight. Packs of wolves sprinted by as I trudged to rescue a captured companion from two ideologically opposed factions of forest dwellers. The section was ultimately linear, but I could progress in water, on land, or up in the trees.But then I reached more heavily populated areas, and the enemies suddenly decided they could see me through walls. I saved and reloaded repeatedly in hopes of ghosting my way through these sections, but to no avail. Eventually, I had every inch of the terrain memorized, but people kept spotting me or bodies I\u2019d left behind (which you can\u2019t move) out of nowhere. I couldn\u2019t figure out why, no matter how much I searched for an answer. Finally, I just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and sprinted through these areas, taking damage and hitting checkpoints. It all felt sloppy, like these ambitious level design ideas didn\u2019t quite mesh with the systems created for this game, in particular.The game\u2019s last main area, more than any other, is as Metro as Metro gets, with oodles of atmosphere oozing from its straightforward tunnels. But it also plays things safe, introduces a superfluous new character instead of honing in on a central relationship that\u2019s crucial to the ending, and generally rushes to a fairly flat conclusion. When I finished the game and watched its bittersweet ending unfold, I didn\u2019t really feel anything. I wanted to, but that\u2019s Exodus\u2019 very peculiar trick: it regularly makes you want to care, but only rarely creates circumstances in which that actually happens.Throughout the triumphant highs and frustrating lows of these journeys, the train and my compatriots chilling out on it provided a welcome reprieve. Between missions, I\u2019d stagger back to our messy closet of a home, take a load off, and just listen for a while. This has always been one of the Metro series\u2019 great joys: occupying spaces overflowing with the detritus of people\u2019s meager existences and overhearing conversations about their hopes, dreams, concerns, fears, and pasts.In Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light, those people were mostly randos you\u2019d never see again after progressing to the next area. Exodus\u2019 cast, however, sticks with you through thick and thin, so their conversations build on each other. They react to new locations and your decisions. It feels good to have them acknowledge, for example, that you managed to complete a mission without any bloodshed. The game\u2019s morality system is more streamlined than those of previous Metro games, and is mostly tied to your decisions about whether or not to kill people. But it was the thought of being praised by my friends that motivated me to meticulously play and replay missions in hopes of K.O.-ing or avoiding everyone. These characters start out as a stock cast of soldier archetypes\u2014the risk-taker, the smart one, the foreigner, the gruff general with a heart of gold, etc\u2014but they evolve into more over time.Well... a little more. For all the heart underlying Exodus\u2019 dialogue, it\u2019s often stilted, awkward, poorly acted (unless you\u2019re playing in Russian), and repetitive. Characters really, really, really like to talk, but they tend to do so in the form of expository info dumps. On one hand, the sheer amount of this stuff that\u2019s in the game is tremendously impressive. When I say I spent hours listening to people talk, I mean it: at least three or four in total, probably more. You pretty much have to if you want to get to know characters, given that their characterizations in the main plot are thin, verging on non-existent. For example, Artyom\u2019s wife Anna\u2014allegedly a hardass sniper and a pillar of the team\u2014spends the story getting kidnapped, falling into a pit and needing to be rescued, getting kidnapped again, etc. If you don\u2019t talk to her between missions, you have no real reason to care about this, or any of the other big beats, in a plot that gets the job done but leans heavily on predictable clich\u00e9s.\"Maybe the real post-apocalypse was the friends we made along the way.\"Scenic train ride through the Russian countryside.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "331671b5-a769-4222-a7e0-246814826f04": {"__data__": {"id_": "331671b5-a769-4222-a7e0-246814826f04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "8261b8f8-36a0-4fab-b0ca-8b05c94f8656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9587d937401d686a63d850db716d36ee704e105c9cdf073c95196acbf8816d97"}, "3": {"node_id": "497aff72-95eb-45d1-a01e-347238bfa107", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a95daca3d3bc2e5a93a247a0d0a6692e4393aa982b1334789bf0b15b767e88e1"}}, "hash": "085d49cb9db91a824eebe3db19882e07fd311236d6ae668d44a418168fb8bd97", "text": "\"Scenic train ride through the Russian countryside.

I use quotation marks because Artyom is a silent protagonist, so everybody talks at, over, under, around, and through him. In previous Metro games, this made sense because Artyom wasn\u2019t really part of any of the places he visited. He was transient, more observer than character. In Exodus, however, he\u2019s got a consistent crew of friends, a wife, and a father-in-law. They clearly care about him, but there\u2019s an awkward disconnect every time they address him. That, in turn, makes it hard to care about many of them. I ended up feeling like I was supposed to care, but only on a few occasions did that actually manifest in powerful emotions.And that\u2019s a shame, because Metro Exodus so badly wants you to love everyone and everything in it as much as its own creators clearly do. It\u2019s one of the most earnest blockbusters I\u2019ve played in ages, a janky mix between a modern open-world game and a too-ambitious-for-its-own-good late-2000s-style shooter that tries with all its heart to do absolutely everything and alternates between succeeding gloriously and failing miserably. It cares. It cares so much. It cares about its detailed environments and mechanics, even when they misfire. It cares about its characters, even though there are too many of them. It cares about its central message of understanding, rather than vilifying, each faction you come into conflict with, even though this message is attached to a ho-hum plot. It sincerely believes that there is hope for humanity even after the end of the world. I love it for what it wants to be more than what it is, but that\u2019s still love of a sort.I\u2019m back on the train with my ragtag family. A conversation turns toward the future, toward a home free of radiation and mutants, toward dreams and new generations. We toast. We drink. Stepan plays a song about generals and trains and people losing their way and trying to find it again. It is warm. It heartfelt. It is painfully on the nose. It is Metro.\nUSgamer, By taking its grim post-apocalyptic world above ground into wide, open areas, Metro Exodus adds a smart and engaging twist while retaining the series\u2019 identity. There\u2019s been some concern from fans in the run up to release. The words \u2018open world\u2019 have been thrown around, and that\u2019s a concept that really couldn\u2019t be more of the antithesis to what made Metro popular in the first place: a series about claustrophobia, confinement, being trapped. While Metro Exodus does bring a completely new sensibility of world design, it works brilliantly.The world of Metro Exodus isn\u2019t really open world, mind you. It\u2019s linear, yet wide. After some initial set pieces and story-related preambles, the core structure comes into focus. Your group has hijacked a train and are using it to cross the wastes of Russia and Eastern Europe, ravaged as they have been by the nuclear war. It\u2019s a post-apocalyptic road trip, but it ain\u2019t The Road.Along the way the train is forced to stop by obstacles, a lack of resources, and for other story reasons. Each time the train stops you\u2019re booted off into a new environment. Each is large enough that it\u2019ll take several minutes to traverse one side to the other, but each exists as a unique biome, allowing Exodus to offer a far greater variety of locales and obstacles than the dank tunnels of Moscow\u2019s metro system ever could.Initially it feels fairly familiar, with you sliding down icy banks and exploring dilapidated buildings with that distinct Eastern Bloc architecture. Quickly enough, you\u2019re rowing a little boat across a murky, creature-filled river, driving a banged-up van across an arid desert, or skulking through a picturesque forested valley.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "497aff72-95eb-45d1-a01e-347238bfa107": {"__data__": {"id_": "497aff72-95eb-45d1-a01e-347238bfa107", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "331671b5-a769-4222-a7e0-246814826f04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "085d49cb9db91a824eebe3db19882e07fd311236d6ae668d44a418168fb8bd97"}, "3": {"node_id": "a94ec97e-27ac-4678-8d3e-ff9dbb769577", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3dcf647c5d12e25a9e22c0645bd2ffa3709ff54902476a308a803e633b1633a7"}}, "hash": "a95daca3d3bc2e5a93a247a0d0a6692e4393aa982b1334789bf0b15b767e88e1", "text": "The rogue\u2019s gallery is a rote who\u2019s who of post apocalypse stereotypes \u2013 the bandits, the cannibals, the religious zealots \u2013 but each is well sketched and dispatched before they outstay their welcome.Each area carries with it its own design tweaks that offer something new to consider. While exploring the Caspian desert, a sandstorm can roll in and cause chaos during a pitched gunfight. Some areas become more dangerous at night, while others have mutated, feathered bears that want to rip out your throat. The regular changing of scenery keeps you on your toes, while the nature of Metro\u2019s core mechanics differentiates these apocalyptic sandboxes from the others games.The linear storyline of each area takes you criss-crossing across the map taking down enemy outposts and regularly diving into cramped buildings and underground facilities for some more classic-style Metro action. But if that isn\u2019t enough, each map also features a range of sidequests and exploration opportunities. Metro is still all about limited resources and crafting, too, so taking the time to explore and complete optional content will drastically increase your chances of survival later. Each area should be savored properly, then, as there\u2019s no going back once your train starts chugging on. \n \nWhile the structure is fresh, much else feels distinctively Metro. There\u2019s the heavy, deliberate feeling of combat, worries about gas masks, filters, ammunition, and other supplies. All of this still feels great, and, most importantly, these features transplant into this more open structure brilliantly.The constant search for more materials has led, naturally, to a deeper upgrade and crafting system. Your backpack is essentially a portable workshop with limited capabilities in the field, but you can also bunker down for more in-depth crafting at proper workbenches. Here you can adjust parts on your weapons, clean your equipment to ensure it works properly and even craft extra ammo \u2013 but that requires being fastidious out in the world in scavenging from every corner of every crumbling building.The natural flow of all this is honestly a joy. Exploring a map, following your compass to the next core objective but taking a minor detour along the way to head to a building that looks as though it might hold supplies \u2013 it\u2019s all rich in tension and atmosphere. On the way you might have a nasty encounter with some mutated beasts or wandering thugs, which in turn might cost you valuable ammo. When you do get inside those buildings, it\u2019s all flashlights and night vision, tight corners and stress: it feels like Metro.In fact, the experience of playing Metro Exodus was mostly only dampened by bugs. The PC version is temperamental at best, crashing several times and often encountering nasty scripting errors. At one point I lost over an hour of progress because an NPC got stuck on the environment and couldn\u2019t open a door for me. At another point I was left laughing when I was ejected from a moving train, thrown thousands of feet into the air as my excited comrades cheered and celebrated on board. The train steamed away without me, and I fell to my death. Nice.Speaking of comrades, it\u2019s worth noting that Metro Exodus makes a big effort with character \u2013 for better and for worse. Unafraid to make time for a story beat, it means sometimes you\u2019ll have control wrested from you in an immersion-damaging way in order to facilitate a slick first-person action set piece, or be rooted to the spot for what feels like an age while two characters talk about their motivations. It\u2019s even got that The Darkness moment where you sit on a couch with your wife leaning across you, or totally Wolfenstein moments where a mangled, insane villain monologues at you before you begin a daring escape.Sometimes this stuff falls a little flat. It\u2019s deeply ambitious, but it feels as though the budget wasn\u2019t quite there to match those ambitions. Sometimes they click, however \u2013 stunning, one-off establishing shots of a crumbling environment, or moments on the train where, for a moment, there\u2019s shades of the fireside camp shenanigans of Red Dead Redemption 2. Some moments are genuinely tender, too.Here the ambition of Metro Exodus shows, though it\u2019s not at all where it is at its best. That\u2019s when you\u2019re out in the open world, scavenging and scrabbling together resources in order to repair your gas mask and stock up on ammo before going on a dungeon crawling dive into an abandoned bunker. It\u2019s when a sandstorm rolls in midway through a slugfest of a firefight. It\u2019s when scripting gets out of the way and solidly-built game systems can simply interact and create something special.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a94ec97e-27ac-4678-8d3e-ff9dbb769577": {"__data__": {"id_": "a94ec97e-27ac-4678-8d3e-ff9dbb769577", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "497aff72-95eb-45d1-a01e-347238bfa107", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a95daca3d3bc2e5a93a247a0d0a6692e4393aa982b1334789bf0b15b767e88e1"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9a8994a-62a8-4418-bd03-e13ab1d0ccc6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b19ebd39ffb12e5f8eb02cc6d60f93bdfd54fe42d977ad7bed8b6e4d98934e10"}}, "hash": "3dcf647c5d12e25a9e22c0645bd2ffa3709ff54902476a308a803e633b1633a7", "text": "When Metro Exodus does all that \u2013 which admittedly isn\u2019t all the time \u2013 it\u2019s a brilliant, smart sequel.Metro Exodus releases for PC, Xbox One and PS4 on 15 February.

In Metro Exodus, Artyom and the gang are making their way to the surface in an adventure that spans the breadth of post-apocalyptic Russia.Though the subject matter is overrepresented in modern media, Metro has managed to put its unique spin on it with its story of human survival within the subway stations of Moscow. I feared that the franchise would lose its punch by going above ground, but after completing Metro Exodus, it\u2019s obvious that was the only direction the story could go and add a new veneer of freshness.At its core, though, Metro Exodus is still very much a Metro game, and the sense of foreboding and claustrophobia is still here in spades. Artyom somehow continually finds himself in dank, rotting, dark places that he can barely wiggle through.Review PC SpecsMetro Exodus continues the story of Artyom, a Ranger of the SPARTA Order. By this point, he\u2019s become an elite soldier and is well respected throughout the Metro. However, Artyom isn\u2019t satisfied with life underground. He theorizes that humanity has survived in other regions than Moscow alone and after detecting a radio signal he begins frantically combing the surface above the Metro trying to pick it up again.Artyom\u2019s search leads to him and his wife Anna becoming aware of a conspiracy by the leaders of their faction, the Hanseatic League, to keep Moscow in a communications blackout with a series of powerful jammers. After this discovery, Artyom, Anna, Anna\u2019s father (and commander of the Order soldiers) Miller, and several Order soldiers are forced to leave the Metro aboard a train.Since they are unable to return home, the group christens the train Aurora, and decides to put Artyom\u2019s theory to the test by striking out and searching for other human survivors. From the icy shores of the Volga in winter to the blistering summer heat of a now desertous Caspian Sea, their journey encompasses a year\u2019s worth of time and takes them thousands of kilometers across Russia.Along the way, we get to know the crew of the Aurora in detail, and the marked passage of time lends itself well to the story. The dialog between characters mentions events past, and their relationships change and deepen as time goes on. The Aurora itself becomes sort of a character as its form changes as time goes on. Cars and equipment are added as the story progresses, and it goes from just a regular locomotive to a home.Even though many areas of the world that Artyom visits are ruins, even those shattered places have a story to tell. For those who like to explore, you can find out the fates of those who inhabited the crumbled wreckage and what the surviving inhabitants\u2019 struggles have been.Like previous Metro games, morality plays an integral part in how your version of the story will unfold. There can be dire consequences if you choose to be overly violent or pass by an opportunity to help someone in need.The game lets you know when you\u2019ve made a moral choice by flashing blue if it\u2019s an honorable decision or orange if you\u2019ve done something deplorable. Each action you take in the game can affect this to some extent. For example, if you wipe out most of a group of enemies, the remainder may choose to surrender. If you decide to murder them afterward, then you\u2019ll lose moral points.While the effects of these decisions may not be immediately apparent, you\u2019ll find that they can have a significant impact on the game. In the Volga, for example, you run into a faction that is hostile to you. However, this is only because their religion violently rejects technology. As you\u2019re invading their territory in an attempt to further your own goals, the moral choice is to minimize your impact on these people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92b6baac-6faf-4f4a-aeb9-da2d134eae5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "92b6baac-6faf-4f4a-aeb9-da2d134eae5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9a8994a-62a8-4418-bd03-e13ab1d0ccc6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b19ebd39ffb12e5f8eb02cc6d60f93bdfd54fe42d977ad7bed8b6e4d98934e10"}, "3": {"node_id": "48e9218c-e14f-4c30-94c3-28456e921ca8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a66198b16c39d0b0a411924b1a1cf7d4c3083230d50dbbcadc376e36a6bb7542"}}, "hash": "d72a4b5472022d2cdf95640798e19b4f31b1288fac11f1d8b04b80af9373fac7", "text": "By respecting them, and knocking out enemies instead of killing them, you\u2019ll earn the begrudging respect of the faction, which means they\u2019ll be more likely to surrender to you and your dealings with them may be a bit easier.Alternatively, wanton destruction and murder can lead to the opposite. Too much violence against a group and you\u2019ll find that instead of becoming friendly, or at least neutral, they\u2019ll increasingly negative in their dealings with you. This can make parts of the story harder, and in the worst case, you may lose members of your crew in one way or another.The morality system plays out in a more overarching manner as well. There are multiple endings, which will be affected by what moral choices you made throughout the game.\u00a0Metro Exodus has excellent environmental design and ambiance. Light and sound are masterfully used to create tension and factor heavily into gameplay. Artyom has access to an arsenal of gear and weapons that grows as the game goes on. However, he\u2019s not a one-man army.Metro Exodus takes a more realistic approach to inventory management in that Artyom can only hold three weapons, and only a handful of ammunition for each. This means that stealth is often the best way to get through an area, and you have to be cognizant of how much noise you\u2019re making and how visible you are to succeed. Crouching lowers the amount of sound you make, but enemies won\u2019t be fooled in proximity. Unlike many games, the crunch of your footsteps will give you away if you\u2019re too close to a foe, which means finding hiding spots and means of distraction are incredibly vital.Light too plays a big part in stealth in Metro Exodus. Many of the areas you enter are without power, bathing the area in darkness. Because of this, you\u2019ll be using your flashlight often. However, your flashlight gives your position away. This means you\u2019ll often find yourself in the tense situation of having to sit in the dark waiting for enemies to pass.You can use light as a weapon against enemies as well. Almost every light source in the game can be switched off or destroyed, so you can make it easier to stealth past or kill a foe by taking away their ability to see. The emphasis on light also factors into the game\u2019s day and night system. You can choose to visit a location in the day when mutants may not be out and where it\u2019s easier for you to see. However, your ability to use stealth will be severely curtailed in the daylight. There are many little tactical decisions you have the make throughout the game, and pulling off a successful infiltration really feels like an accomplishment when you do it right.While the environmental sound is excellent, I had some major issues with speaking, captions, and signage/text. Pretty much all the environmental text in the game is written in Cyrillic. That makes sense because the game takes place in Russia. The problem is I can\u2019t read Cyrillic.I thought the text issue might be helped by the fact that there\u2019s an option in the menu to turn on captions for signs. Unfortunately, only a tiny amount of the signage and text in the game has captions. Furthermore, the captions seem a bit off in the way they\u2019re implemented. Sometimes you have to stand in the exact right spot to get them to activate. If you\u2019re too close, or too far from the text then they don\u2019t come up.If you\u2019re trying to get, the signage captions to appear it can be a bit of an exercise in frustration as well. If you\u2019re not in the correct \u201czone\u201d for them to show up, they\u2019ll just pop right off the screen. This can lead to you missing out if you\u2019re not paying close attention because you can zoom right through the zone and the caption will pop on and off the screen before you realize it was there. With the overwhelming amount of Cyrillic text and signage in the game, I would have loved if more of it was translated and there was a more reliable caption system in place.You also have to pay close attention to when characters are speaking. There\u2019s no dialog system, so you just have to stand in one place until someone is done talking. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to know when a conversation is over. You have free reign to move about pretty much whenever you\u2019re not in a cutscene, so you can miss out on valuable plot and characterization just because you accidentally walked off too early.There also seems to be a bit of an issue with audio cues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48e9218c-e14f-4c30-94c3-28456e921ca8": {"__data__": {"id_": "48e9218c-e14f-4c30-94c3-28456e921ca8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "92b6baac-6faf-4f4a-aeb9-da2d134eae5c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d72a4b5472022d2cdf95640798e19b4f31b1288fac11f1d8b04b80af9373fac7"}, "3": {"node_id": "0506740a-d2b5-4015-9d79-9cc67a101ebc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6c4ee3858e2965f86431f028cc173879ae272ffed90bf5b3c31d1bc8ecf48a39"}}, "hash": "a66198b16c39d0b0a411924b1a1cf7d4c3083230d50dbbcadc376e36a6bb7542", "text": "For most of the game everyone\u2019s lines came out just fine, but sometimes it seemed like a character would be talking, and then another would start just before the first person\u2019s line was over. In some places, it was hard to pay attention to what everyone was saying because three people would be talking at once off cue.A variation of this issue sometimes appears when you\u2019re listening to tape recordings at times as well. Throughout the game, you can find tape recorders which contain audio logs that fill in some of the backstories of an area. Unfortunately, the game doesn\u2019t take into account when you\u2019re listening to one, so sometimes a character will come in over the radio and just talk over the audio log.This wouldn\u2019t be a huge issue if not for the fact that the captions don\u2019t really work well when this is going on. The game will try and display the text for both the tape recording audio and the character speaking at the same time. This means you\u2019ll miss out on a good half of both the recording and the conversation piping in over the radio.I played Metro Exodus on PC and was able to check out the RTX lighting. Up to this point I had only seen its implementation in Battlefield 5, which was cool, but it\u2019s a bit too fast-paced to really soak up the raytracing. Metro Exodus on the other hand in the perfect game for this new technology.Seeing the real-time shadows and lighting effects added a lot of ambiance to the game and showed just how much those little touches could bring to a game. Seeing tree shadows moving in real time as the moon or sun shine down on them was amazing, and it\u2019s definitely something I want to see more of in future games.Unfortunately, in the review build, there were some graphical glitches with lighting when I had RTX on. Sometimes shadows would spaz out on objects, and several times the whole screen was covered in a haloing black smudge. Fortunately, restarting the game was enough to fix these glitches in every case. It\u2019s entirely possible that a new set of Nvidia drivers or a patch to the game might clear these up as well.Metro Exodus also supports DLSS, which is handy to have on when you\u2019re using RTX. With DLSS on I saw minimal drops in FPS when RTX was activated. The only complaint I have is that DLSS seems to make things a bit \u201csoft.\u201d However, the FPS gain from using it makes that slight gripe worth it, and I think it\u2019s a good solution if you\u2019re looking to keep above 60 FPS and still want that juicy raytracing.Post-apocalyptic games are a dime a dozen, which is why it\u2019s so surprising that Metro Exodus manages to break away from the competition and stand on its own. As you proceed through Exodus, it becomes an odyssey. You grow to care about Artyom, Anna, Miller, and the rest, and you really root for them to succeed in their journey to find an unspoiled part of the world to call their home.It\u2019s hard not to draw a comparison between Metro Exodus and the Fallout series. Both are open-world and set in a time after which man has destroyed himself and the world. However, Exodus is a much tighter, more focused experience. In fact, though there are open maps and exploration elements, I would say this game would be more appropriately called semi-linear. You\u2019re given free rein at times to check out the map, and there\u2019s plenty to look at and weapons, gear, and collectibles out there waiting. However, the task at hand is always clear.If you\u2019re someone who is intimidated by the thought of another sprawling, 50+ hour open-world experience, don\u2019t count Metro out. This game does a really great job of giving you just enough leash to get some good exploring in while making sure you don\u2019t forget that there is an overarching plot going on.Metro Exodus is everything I wish the Fallout series would be. It\u2019s a serious story that takes you on an epic journey across a continent and makes you feel like what you\u2019re doing actually matters. It lasts just long enough (around 25-30 hours) to really blow it out of the park and leave you wanting more. 4A Games did a great job on Metro Exodus, but a few glitches (particularly in the audio department) keep it from being a true masterpiece.I sincerely hope that with some patches the rough edges of Metro Exodus can be worked out.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0506740a-d2b5-4015-9d79-9cc67a101ebc": {"__data__": {"id_": "0506740a-d2b5-4015-9d79-9cc67a101ebc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "48e9218c-e14f-4c30-94c3-28456e921ca8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a66198b16c39d0b0a411924b1a1cf7d4c3083230d50dbbcadc376e36a6bb7542"}, "3": {"node_id": "5a5314ea-3f1c-4267-ae1f-207521ff2467", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "871b161689eb5a2117c7fd19d09d4c56d2e4be7ea509978ec0a89bb6699f3366"}}, "hash": "6c4ee3858e2965f86431f028cc173879ae272ffed90bf5b3c31d1bc8ecf48a39", "text": "It\u2019s almost there but has just enough technical issues to cause some frustration.GameRevolution reviewed Metro Exodus on PC via a digital copy provided by the publisher.8Jason Faulkner is Evolve Media's Senior SEO Editor.

Still, ever the pro, I rose above my fears and pressed onward, determined to check out Deep Silver\u2019s sombre sequel.Metro Exodus (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One)Developer: 4A GamesPublisher: Deep SilverRelease: February 15, 2019MSRP: $59.99After a brilliantly conceived opening sequence, Metro Exodus drops players into the boots of Spartan soldier Artyom Chyornj. Artyom and his wife Anna \u2013 along with their fellow squad members \u2013 live underneath post-nuked Moscow, struggling to make a life for themselves away from the suffocating radiation of the overground. It should be noted that players can, for the most part, jump straight into Exodus with no prior history. The intro sequence quickly and effectively expositions the backstory before you trot off into the belly of the underground.After an awkward, clunky first chapter, Metro Exodus conspires to have Artyom and party venture out beyond the city limits. Riding aboard a purloined train \u2013 The Aurora \u2013 our crew travels to various wide-open locations, where a series of objectives must be completed before the locomotive can resume its journey \u2013 albeit with a few more (or perhaps less) passengers along for the ride. It\u2019s a narrative device that breaks Exodus down into several small-scale open-worlds. The Aurora visits environments such as luscious woodland of The Taiga, the frozen marshland of The Volga, and the sad remnants of what was The Caspian Sea. Without giving too much away, it\u2019s a long haul for our heroes. Exodus doesn\u2019t exactly take place over the course of a lazy weekend.When it comes to atmosphere, Metro Exodus kills it. Once out on the open rails, each area is stunningly detailed and meticulously designed. Burnt-out buildings, web-filled storage containers, crashed transportation, murky swamps, bandit camps and abandoned homes, all of which feel instantly recognisable from similar locales explored in the Fallout series.Here, however, 4A Games has created a visual environment with a realism that goes far beyond the tech of Bethesda\u2019s own nuclear adventures. Metro Exodus looks incredible, its desolate world backed by dynamic sound effects, realistic weather and authentic seasonal changes. Whenever we dare venture indoors, we find rusted machinery, flickering lamps, rotting corpses, mold, fungi and worse. You can practically smell the must. All of the above creates the impression of a civilisation that once was, but is no more. A population stopped dead in its tracks in the blink of an eye. It\u2019s eerie, disquieting, and wholly effective. They say the devil\u2019s in the details, and 4A Games get this; wispy gun-barrel smoke, the weak flicker of low-quality night-vision, a visor smeared in blood.

Monster attacks in Exodus are heart-racing affairs, executed with a sense of genuine panic. It\u2019s funny how you eventually feel relaxed when facing off against squads of heavily-armed bandits, just because they\u2019re \u201conly humans.\u201dThough I\u2019m deservedly painting a solid-gold picture of Metro Exodus\u2018 atmosphere, environments and denizens, I unfortunately have to head south when discussing some other aspects. Exodus\u2019 story falls flat, not so much in concept \u2013 the \u201cRail Trip of Doom\u201d is a great narrative device \u2013 but overall story engagement is let down by terrible dialogue. The script often delivered with a style that is at times unintentionally hilarious.Mixed poorly into the game\u2019s audio, the dialogue is hurried, muddled in context and off-putting, breaking the taut drama instilled by the outside world. In a bad design holdover from previous games, Artyom is a silent protagonist, speaking only during Exodus\u2019 lengthy loading screens. When Anna is bearing her soul to him, Artyom doesn\u2019t speak a single word in response. It comes across as utterly ridiculous, breaking player/character relations. In MachineGames\u2019 Wolfenstein, B.J. Blazkowicz is his own man, with a voice, a face and believable chemistry with his band of brothers. Here, Artyom is nothing, a faceless avatar who fails to engage with strangers, friends, his lover, and ultimately, the player.Metro Exodus is specifically built around its crafting mechanic, which can sometimes bring pacing to a dead halt. There are options to reduce these elements, but choosing said option also nerfs in-game difficulty. This makes it tough to find the sweet spot between pulse-pounding, challenging fun and time spent sat building filters for your gas mask, repeatedly cleaning your entire arsenal of weapons, improving your anti-radiation defence, or any other number of micro-management busy-work. Meticulous detail works wonders in Exodus\u2019 world design, but here in the buzzkill of crafting it can become an unwelcome break from the fun of exploration. Metro Exodus\u2018 strengths lie in traveling, meeting new people, delving into backstories, and tensely stepping through abandoned buildings \u2013 where sudden horror awaits in every corner \u2013 not huddled over a workbench, pouring over an inventory so you can make six more bullets for your gun (that might jam after you fire three of them). For those who want exciting adventure without all the red tape, I\u2019d suggest hitting a lower difficulty and just enjoying the wild ride. Conversely, fans of bullet-counting and dumpster diving will be in their survivalist element, with a whole host of bizarre attachments available for your favourite skull-popper.Metro Exodus will be a killer release for franchise fans. Exodus\u2019 Russia plays host to creepy-beyond-belief locations, populated with threats that will leave stains on your eyeballs. When treading tentatively across uncomfortably quiet terrain \u2013 trigger-finger at the ready \u2013 every single door opening makes you hold your breath. It\u2019s here where Metro Exodus is simply glorious.When not out in the great unknown, however, Exodus tends to get bogged down by a dogged insistence on overly-fiddly technical details and humdrum foraging. Furthermore, Exodus\u2019 personality-free protagonist and his pals can leave players alternately stifling giggles or rolling their eyes. Fortunately, exciting set-pieces, blood-pumping combat and the changing landscape work hard to keep boredom at bay.Metro Exodus is a tour-de-force in apocalyptic exploration. It offers a rich, evolving world, brought to life with stunning visuals, immersive sound and ghastly creatures. These thrills and chills are irritatingly tempered with menial tasks, poor voice acting, dull stealth and a soulless hero, all of which prevent Metro Exodus from achieving its true potential. Behind these grievances, however, lies an absolutely thrilling adventure for anyone who dares board The Aurora. Just prepare to get your ticket punched.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.] GoodSolid and definitely has an audience.

When I first dove into the dark, nuclear-ridden world of the Metro series with Metro 2033, I was instantly engrossed in the story. The dialogue, pacing and overall experience was something memorable. The tension that the shadowed corridors of the metro brought was unforgettable. 4A managed to capture this same tension and attention to detail with Metro Last Light, and now, with Metro Exodus the developer has tried to up the ante even more, offering massive open-world portions of the countryside up as a delicate treat.There\u2019s a lot to love about this new way that 4A has approached the story in Metro Exodus. While I will say I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the large, open-world portions, overall the experience is tied together extremely well. This allows it to deliver a tense and unforgettable experience that helps to bring Artyom\u2019s story to a nice close, should the developer want to move on and tell other stories within this world.In Metro Exodus, players finally get a clear view of the world outside of Moscow. It\u2019s a lot different than the debris-riddled tunnels that you explored in the first two games, instead trading the more claustrophobia inducing passages for rolling hills, mountains and pathways. While the new environments are beautiful and haunting\u2014the landscape is pockmarked with various debris and structures from before the war\u2014they feel empty at times, as you move from objective to objective. I\u2019d even go so far as to say that some areas of the game start to feel less like a Metro game and more like a generic open-world, survival game set in the apocalypse.This is, of course, an issue that we\u2019ve seen in plenty of open-world games, and while 4A has done a good job of offering up some additional storylines and quests for players to explore. Metro Exodus still feels best when you\u2019re following the path that they\u2019ve clearly defined for you, making your way through the story. This is where the real tension lies, and that\u2014at least for me\u2014is what makes the Metro series stand out from other games in this vein.There are also times where the series roots start to show through, as massive points of exposition are thrown at you as you just stand there, waiting for your companions to finish carrying on about their life stories. It\u2019s a nice touch, as you get to know the characters a bit, but it also makes talking to people feel like a chore at times. While you can often just walk away from these encounters, listening to people talk is also how you gather up valuable information. As you explore and sneak around, you\u2019ll often hear the conversations of your enemies. Sure, you could sneak up and stab the guy blocking your path in the throat, but if you take the time to listen to him, he might also reveal some useful information, like a back way into the camp you\u2019re trying to infiltrate.The size of the world isn\u2019t the only thing that\u2019s changed, though.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba67c220-5e4a-4fdd-ae58-955277834790": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba67c220-5e4a-4fdd-ae58-955277834790", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "5875b7c1-708d-42a3-89a3-55a2a801cd1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2dd49010d120cceee707864115373dfeb42c14bb584979ab7120df2fc46a4eb1"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3bb43c2-2c76-496b-bb8a-018b8c02aa41", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f790df2ef484245353d6808e0560be9233a291ad30f6fb6f230cb64dd305038"}}, "hash": "c9455a3d00be2705197ba514048589e84dade8eb0697e7c16f92fd6c4747bddf", "text": "In Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light, players would have to scrounge for ammunition, purchasing it from vendors, or taking it off the bodies of their enemies. This time around, you can craft your own ammo and items thanks to a new Workbench system, as well as a backpack that Artyom carries around. Resources are still scarce, though, and you\u2019ll want to watch how you use your ammunition and filters, as getting caught low on supplies can often prove fatal.Another new system that you\u2019ll see come into play a bit during your time in Metro Exodus is the sleeping system, which allows you to pass time and heal up without using your medkits. Passing time can give you alternate ways to approach situations, as bandits and the like will often patrol less at night, and the darkness will make it easier to sneak around, taking out enemies without causing undue panic. This was the biggest thing that I liked about the more open approach to situations, as it allows you to think for yourself and really explore the different options available.All in all, the changes made to the formula are good, and help to create a better experience all around for those looking to dive deeper into Artyom\u2019s story. The open-world portions of the game are still worth exploring, despite the fact that a lot of times, traveling from point to point can feel a bit empty. I just wish that they\u2019d peppered more content throughout the large areas, as it would have helped to carry the tension and overall feel of the game more evenly throughout.Despite the love I have for the new, more open approaches, Metro Exodus still feels best when you\u2019re exploring the dark, underground passages of the Russian landscape. The feeling of claustrophobia that sets in as you move through the tunnels, spiders squirming into the shadows as your flashlight paints a narrow beam across the floor. That\u2019s where the Metro series really shines, and Metro Exodus has so many moments like this plastered throughout the story.4A Games have done an excellent job of continuing Artyom\u2019s tale, all while evolving and making it grow to something far bigger than before. While a lot of the open-world stuff can feel empty at times, the world is still beautiful and haunting, making it worth exploring. The dialogue, while a bit much at intervals, really helps to bring the setting to life. Taking time and listening to the things that people have to say will open up even more options for you, and give you access to more story and lore.Metro Exodus is best when it follows the classic Metro formula, painting the world with tension as you dive deeper into the darkness of the world. While the game does suffer with a bit of an identity crisis at times, at the end of it all, the tension and fear that is peppered throughout more than makes the journey worth the trouble as players get their first look at a much bigger world and the dangers that lie within it.To learn more about Artyom's latest adventure, head over to our Metro Exodus home page.This review is based on a PC copy of the game provided by the publisher.

(At the top of that heap is The Witcher 3, whose previous two games were decidedly less even; more recent examples include Elex, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and The Technomancer.) And rarely do these games hold players' hands, usually because they lack tutorials or because of unclear GUI elements.Metro Exodus, like the two Metro games that 4A Studios made before it, has all of those qualities in spades\u2014though it's definitely the most accessible Eurojank shooter I've come across. And yes, calling this the \"most accessible Eurojank shooter\" is like calling Taco Bell the \"most flavorful national Mexican chain restaurant.\" But its strides toward accessibility are important, because this is a game of high highs and so-so lows. You'll need to slog through some obvious imperfections. Do that, however, and you're in for the kind of player- and challenge-respecting solo experience that people say they're always dreaming about in comment threads about always-online games.Plus, in this game's case, there's a particular beauty in store for anybody who ponied up for one of Nvidia's new RTX-series graphics cards. As a result, I spent my review period focusing quite a bit on the RTX experience and came away mostly impressed. What kind of game makes you okay with trading frames for ray tracing boosts? A game like Metro Exodus, that's what.For anybody who skipped or doesn't remember the previous Metro games\u2014based on the books of Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky\u2014Exodus starts out with\u00a0a lengthy pre-rendered sequence that sums up the Metro universe in ridiculously tidy fashion. A nuclear apocalypse has forced Russia's citizens into an underground network, where they've built their lives anew, only to face two equally deadly forces: supernatural monsters and political friction.Now, silent protagonist Artyom has begun putting more muscle into a personal quest: to find signs of life elsewhere on Earth. To do this, he disobeys direct orders, goes topside, and\u2014sure enough\u2014finds more than he or his comrades had ever expected.What follows, as has been revealed in hands-on previews of the game, is a significant change of pace for the series. The prior games' underground focus meant that its combat-loaded levels were decidedly linear affairs, albeit ones with satisfying firepower and decent stealth-path options. Metro Exodus still has a linear thrust, but it also gives players a massive canvas of outdoor spaces, which appear in each of the game's \"seasons.\"When a new chapter begins, you'll usually land in a massive, architecture-filled\u00a0instance that can be traversed however you please. Instead of using invisible walls or artificial barriers, Exodus makes its open-sky zones some of the most dangerous ones in the game. You can get from point A to pretty much anywhere in a given zone, whether on foot or with optional transportation (like a rowboat in the first \"winter\" zone). But once you're outside the demarcated paths, the worst monsters\u2014big, hulking, hairy beasts with terrifying snarls\u2014are more likely to be on the prowl\u00a0and\u00a0run in packs and\u00a0see you in the open-air valleys that separate you from an intriguing tower or power facility.The result is a lovely risk-reward equation to manage as an open-world gamer. Is an optional run to an interesting-looking building worth the trouble? Will you pick up a killer new weapon attachment or a boatload of crafting supplies, and will the amount of ammo and health packs you burn through be worth it? 4A Games pushes the needle on this adventuring quality by doing a pretty remarkable thing in open-world games: keeping its 3D architecture diverse and interesting, while managing some clever content copy-and-pasting across giant ecosystems. (Also, you won't face a single loading screen when you're in a particular zone.)Anybody who disliked Fallout 4's generic landscapes as much as I did will be delighted by the environmental post-nuclear storytelling and discovery opportunities that Exodus contains. Every harrowing run in this game has\u00a0something to peel back and savor.Exodus is also careful to keep some of the game's basics manageable amid the challenging parts. Crafting and \"cleaning\" add some complication and flavor to weapon upkeep, but these systems revolve around a simple item currency.

As of press time, there's still something weird going on with human enemies' responses to your presence. This typically errs more on the side of \"why doesn't that guy see me,\" as opposed to \"how did that guy see me through a wall.\" Some of the game's epic firefights and stealth missions are made easier by shooting your gun into the air, thus triggering your foes' wonky searching AI.Sometimes, they'll come right toward you for easy kills (aided by the game's generous and silent throwing knife weapon, which can be tossed and then retrieved from a corpse for constant reuse in a game with limited ammo). Sometimes, they'll glitch-walk off a building's edge and hover in a way that stops them from accurately targeting you. Sometimes, they shout \"I see him!\" while facing in the opposite direction and standing still, so you can take your sweet time and line up a killing blow.It's not all bad. The game's monsters are a bit less prone to this stupidity, which solidifies their importance as an open-world \"police\" force of sorts. And don't count on that \"shoot in the air\" gimmick to work in many of the firefights. In some of the best missions and moments, there's no getting around the use of stealth, flanking, or other smart combat, and thank goodness. But there's enough AI wonkiness to mute the sense that Metro Exodus must be played a certain way to overcome its daunting difficulty. And I find Exodus is more fun when played in that \"oh crap oh crap oh crap\" mode.Next up on the negatives list is the game's rough on-boarding and introduction to how the Metro universe works. If you don't dig through help menus, which themselves are a bit thin, you'll never get an explanation about occasionally required gas masks or about what on-screen button prompts mean when a new weapon appears on the ground. In some cases, a single tooltip appears for a new in-game system and then vanishes forever if you miss it. In my case, I still have no in-game answer to exactly how to \"mark\" distant objects when I see them through a pair of binoculars\u2014and that's no small thing for a game that asks players to search far and wide across massive landscapes.The same issue goes for the game's health system, which indicates player damage by making the screen's border redder and redder and adds heavy breathing. At what point am I a single hit away from death? Does a health kit fully heal my character? And if my gas mask runs out of air tanks, how long can I survive before Artyom chokes? This is all a bit unclear.Last up is the plot, which isn't bad as much as it is uneven and verbose. Metro series fans already know what they're in for: the plot is primarily doled out in \"stay awhile and listen\" stretches of expository dialogue.\u00a0These emerge primarily when you're back at your home base and chatting with fellow soldiers, but they also come up when you happen upon a non-violent NPC in one of the game's massive zones and they start yapping and yapping.Do you like a game whose combat and discovery mechanics are\u00a0entirely divorced from stop-and-wait delivery of lengthy, meandering dialogue, always spoken by over-eager actors with thick Eastern European accents? If so, you're in for some genuinely likable moments of character development; they're just firmly nestled in the kinds of overlong stories that might have you saying \"get on with it, man\" after a while. The spoilable plot beats, on the other hand, feel like fine B-movie cheese. Sometimes, these are full of scare-quote \"important\" messages freighted with fromage.

There\u2019s been some concern from fans in the run up to release. The words \u2018open world\u2019 have been thrown around, and that\u2019s a concept that really couldn\u2019t be more of the antithesis to what made Metro popular in the first place: a series about claustrophobia, confinement, being trapped. While Metro Exodus does bring a completely new sensibility of world design, it works brilliantly.The world of Metro Exodus isn\u2019t really open world, mind you. It\u2019s linear, yet wide. After some initial set pieces and story-related preambles, the core structure comes into focus. Your group has hijacked a train and are using it to cross the wastes of Russia and Eastern Europe, ravaged as they have been by the nuclear war. It\u2019s a post-apocalyptic road trip, but it ain\u2019t The Road.Along the way the train is forced to stop by obstacles, a lack of resources, and for other story reasons. Each time the train stops you\u2019re booted off into a new environment. Each is large enough that it\u2019ll take several minutes to traverse one side to the other, but each exists as a unique biome, allowing Exodus to offer a far greater variety of locales and obstacles than the dank tunnels of Moscow\u2019s metro system ever could.Initially it feels fairly familiar, with you sliding down icy banks and exploring dilapidated buildings with that distinct Eastern Bloc architecture. Quickly enough, you\u2019re rowing a little boat across a murky, creature-filled river, driving a banged-up van across an arid desert, or skulking through a picturesque forested valley. The rogue\u2019s gallery is a rote who\u2019s who of post apocalypse stereotypes \u2013 the bandits, the cannibals, the religious zealots \u2013 but each is well sketched and dispatched before they outstay their welcome.Each area carries with it its own design tweaks that offer something new to consider. While exploring the Caspian desert, a sandstorm can roll in and cause chaos during a pitched gunfight. Some areas become more dangerous at night, while others have mutated, feathered bears that want to rip out your throat. The regular changing of scenery keeps you on your toes, while the nature of Metro\u2019s core mechanics differentiates these apocalyptic sandboxes from the others games.The linear storyline of each area takes you criss-crossing across the map taking down enemy outposts and regularly diving into cramped buildings and underground facilities for some more classic-style Metro action. But if that isn\u2019t enough, each map also features a range of sidequests and exploration opportunities. Metro is still all about limited resources and crafting, too, so taking the time to explore and complete optional content will drastically increase your chances of survival later. Each area should be savored properly, then, as there\u2019s no going back once your train starts chugging on. \n \nWhile the structure is fresh, much else feels distinctively Metro. There\u2019s the heavy, deliberate feeling of combat, worries about gas masks, filters, ammunition, and other supplies. All of this still feels great, and, most importantly, these features transplant into this more open structure brilliantly.The constant search for more materials has led, naturally, to a deeper upgrade and crafting system. Your backpack is essentially a portable workshop with limited capabilities in the field, but you can also bunker down for more in-depth crafting at proper workbenches. Here you can adjust parts on your weapons, clean your equipment to ensure it works properly and even craft extra ammo \u2013 but that requires being fastidious out in the world in scavenging from every corner of every crumbling building.The natural flow of all this is honestly a joy. Exploring a map, following your compass to the next core objective but taking a minor detour along the way to head to a building that looks as though it might hold supplies \u2013 it\u2019s all rich in tension and atmosphere. On the way you might have a nasty encounter with some mutated beasts or wandering thugs, which in turn might cost you valuable ammo. When you do get inside those buildings, it\u2019s all flashlights and night vision, tight corners and stress: it feels like Metro.In fact, the experience of playing Metro Exodus was mostly only dampened by bugs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6d4652b-7b64-48f1-bf87-6eb8672bfd6a": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6d4652b-7b64-48f1-bf87-6eb8672bfd6a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "848f5748-42bd-4c9a-9f42-a299aeb3eaf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e2d3d1373f8db9759c2919353533b4d7c496cd3e7b48c0e49abb75a657af152c"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9ff8699-78d1-4f6f-aa78-b923e1c7e00c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1fcf6fdd6c69f5d881aeb5ed3c6c77dbcf1d3299bb89b6d9f6d409643e2ec78"}, "3": {"node_id": "5f7469f9-87b8-4766-9a09-bbc777c21699", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "63b8e994b32099267ca948da6a561a9c5f95ddd852a21365e54bf0d7dd15409e"}}, "hash": "6b5e54effd66cbd5e394fb5536c72895a588c7b63311b2f0b263cd40f240b174", "text": "The PC version is temperamental at best, crashing several times and often encountering nasty scripting errors. At one point I lost over an hour of progress because an NPC got stuck on the environment and couldn\u2019t open a door for me. At another point I was left laughing when I was ejected from a moving train, thrown thousands of feet into the air as my excited comrades cheered and celebrated on board. The train steamed away without me, and I fell to my death. Nice.Speaking of comrades, it\u2019s worth noting that Metro Exodus makes a big effort with character \u2013 for better and for worse. Unafraid to make time for a story beat, it means sometimes you\u2019ll have control wrested from you in an immersion-damaging way in order to facilitate a slick first-person action set piece, or be rooted to the spot for what feels like an age while two characters talk about their motivations. It\u2019s even got that The Darkness moment where you sit on a couch with your wife leaning across you, or totally Wolfenstein moments where a mangled, insane villain monologues at you before you begin a daring escape.Sometimes this stuff falls a little flat. It\u2019s deeply ambitious, but it feels as though the budget wasn\u2019t quite there to match those ambitions. Sometimes they click, however \u2013 stunning, one-off establishing shots of a crumbling environment, or moments on the train where, for a moment, there\u2019s shades of the fireside camp shenanigans of Red Dead Redemption 2. Some moments are genuinely tender, too.Here the ambition of Metro Exodus shows, though it\u2019s not at all where it is at its best. That\u2019s when you\u2019re out in the open world, scavenging and scrabbling together resources in order to repair your gas mask and stock up on ammo before going on a dungeon crawling dive into an abandoned bunker. It\u2019s when a sandstorm rolls in midway through a slugfest of a firefight. It\u2019s when scripting gets out of the way and solidly-built game systems can simply interact and create something special. When Metro Exodus does all that \u2013 which admittedly isn\u2019t all the time \u2013 it\u2019s a brilliant, smart sequel.Metro Exodus releases for PC, Xbox One and PS4 on 15 February.
