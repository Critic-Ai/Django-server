I haven't finished The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I've yet to uncover swathes of its vast map. Much remains for me to do and discover, and my game is still rife with rumour, mystery and surprise. This is partly because my life is no longer compatible with monstering a giant open-world game in a week, even when it's work. But it's also because of the kind of game that Breath of the Wild is.The reason I feel comfortable telling you this is that this isn't a game that any one player can just know. You can map it out, sure - spend weeks or months enumerating all its components and secrets. But the game's magic resides in its combination of sheer size with sheer openness, with apparently freewheeling yet meticulously interlocked systems, and with a scarcely credible level of detail and craft in its making. When a game world like this meets players, alchemy happens. My meandering and half-complete run, full of digressions and doubling back, feels as meaningful as the game of a completist, or of a player who skipped the main quest to take a run straight at the end boss with armour and weapons scavenged from the map's darkest corners, or a player who chose to ignore the storyline altogether in favour of unlocking the mysteries of Hyrule's most elusive Shrines, or of a player who simply headed north to see what lay there. Rarely has a game been so tempting to restart while you were still playing it.Our hero Link awakes on a high plateau in the middle of Hyrule's rugged vastness. Sheer cliffs drop off all around, which conveniently confines us here until we've learned the ropes and earned the paraglider that will guide us safely down to the world below. But those cliffs are also there to give us an unhindered and honestly breathtaking view over the world we're about to explore, from cursed castle to hazy wetland, boiling volcano to parched desert. Amid the misty watercolour washes of this fantasy landscape, you can pick out the sharp glow and alien forms of ancient Sheikah technology: towers that fill in the map, and Shrines that house combat tests and physics puzzles. It's an incredibly promising view, and not a misleading one. Nintendo's first open world is up there with Azeroth and San Andreas as one of the greatest game worlds ever created.Link, it turns out, has been asleep for 100 years, having failed with Zelda to defeat the apocalyptic evil known as Calamity Ganon. Ganon is contained at Hyrule Castle - as is Zelda - but it's up to Link to take a second stab at him. If he wants help, he must journey to the four corners of Hyrule to rehabilitate the Divine Beasts, giant mechanical creatures originally created to defeat Ganon that have now run amok. This is what you would consider the meat of a regular Zelda game - yet, while strongly advised, it's entirely optional.On your travels you will meet the charming and familiar tribes of Hyrule: the aquatic Zora and avian Rito, the tubby rock-munching Gorons and the fierce Gerudo matriarchy which excludes all men from its desert city. The Korok - cute, rattling woodland sprites that first appeared in The Wind Waker - are here too, and they are vital to the tapestry of Breath of the Wild. But you won't be guided to their well-hidden homeland by any quest marker; you'll have to follow rumours and suggestions to find it and know its importance. That is as good an example as any of the remarkable confidence Nintendo's developers have in their world to draw players in, and the trust they have in those players to explore it freely and inquisitively. Few games in this waypoint-infested genre have that courage.You'll also learn about the Sheikah tablet you're carrying, a sort of fantasy iPad that summons bombs and ice blocks, and commands the forces of inertia and magnetism. Although you can upgrade it, its core abilities are all unlocked by the time you leave the starter area. Gear-gating - using the acquisition of new items to manage the player's progress through the game - is one of many 30-year Zelda traditions that Breath of the Wild bravely discards, in favour of giving you pretty much all the tools early on and sending you off to find your own path. Bombs aside, the power-ups you get aren't the ones you're expecting, and they upgrade in unpredictable ways, branching off in new directions rather than simply getting stronger.You'll also learn more about what happened 100 years ago (Link is an amnesiac, of course) in a series of cutscenes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a482b21d-50aa-48d2-b9cc-93e99d811482": {"__data__": {"id_": "a482b21d-50aa-48d2-b9cc-93e99d811482", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a427aa9-d2cc-419e-9491-5828aef213ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7673666d1396c94845052947cee577e5265ccb8d86139b456bba58f453b64bb1"}, "3": {"node_id": "885c27f5-841f-40bd-9c29-cc83edb8903d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "524e2cbe027d6c4a88c037940dafbc63c82660c002abc81460bad03d56755b93"}}, "hash": "f350364bd94f74180b9e54d92f1130061fecf43878d4e9b3bc5b8c11b05fd9e8", "text": "If Breath of the Wild has one weakness, it's as a story. The grand events of the past seem remote from the teeming world around you, not to mention rather hackneyed, while the English voice acting - sparingly used, thankfully - is stiff and cheesy. Unlike such soulful adventures as Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, Breath of the Wild isn't unduly interested in ordinary people and their stories, and it musters neither the poignant little vignettes nor the strong emotional tenor of those games. It doesn't have the memorable characters and simple, pure narrative purpose of The Wind Waker, either. It's a shame - but it doesn't need these things.Arguably, a stronger storyline wouldn't have been compatible with Nintendo's decision to grant the player so much freedom. You really don't get this level of openness anywhere else this side of a Bethesda role-playing game. (The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim is an obvious inspiration.) You can do whatever you like, and go wherever you feel, greatly assisted by Link's ability to climb almost any surface. This is a game that wholly rejects artificial barriers. The further away you get from the centre, the stronger monsters are, but there's no grind to meet their level and the means to match them can be found just through exploring. Breath of the Wild also rewards your curiosity with constant and dazzling inventiveness. It's dumbfounding that such a vast space should be so packed with things to find, observe and do.The designers are squarely focused on keeping you out in this world, and for Zelda traditionalists, that means one major and potentially painful casualty: dungeons. There isn't anything you would describe as a classic Zelda dungeon here, no huge and devious labyrinth of locks and keys, boss fights and puzzles. The gameplay survives in the Shrines, which house the cleverest puzzles in chambers tinged with Portal's austere lab aesthetic, and out in the world, where boss monsters roam and elaborate combat gauntlets await. The Divine Beasts are relatively compact but extremely intricate and rewarding challenges that are probably the closest thing to a dungeon per se. Some Shrines take much longer to complete than others, and are introduced by involved and mysterious quest lines.Underpinning the whole game is an extremely strong and multifaceted suite of linked systems, including weather, stealth, cooking, and a fantastically fun and convincing physics simulation. (Even item drops from enemies are fully physically modelled.) Cooking, which provides useful buffs as well as refilling your health, isn't the recipe list you'd expect; it's a system where the same dish can be conjured from different ingredients and at different potencies. It's not about collection or rote learning, it's about understanding the rules and then improvising with what you have.This is true of the game as a whole, especially in combat, where all Breath of the Wild's tools and systems meet. There are so many variables in a fight - what you happen to be holding, what your enemy is holding, if there are any fires or boulders around, if you're in the eye of a lightning storm and so need to unequip everything metal - that it's almost always better to wing it and try new tactics on the fly than to settle into a groove. This is a game that can play like Dynasty Warriors one minute and Metal Gear Solid the next.Food buffs can help you out hugely if you're under-equipped - and being over-equipped isn't always a good thing. Breath of the Wild's disposable weapons may prove to be the most controversial aspect of its design; weapons wear out fast, and only a few very special ones can be repaired. You're even encouraged to throw them away as they get worn down, as a well-placed lob will earn you a critical hit. It starts out stressful, but it's ultimately a liberating change that's reminiscent of Halo's weapon-swap philosophy. It also has brilliant consequences for Breath of the Wild's sweeping reinterpretation of role-playing game convention.With no experience points to grind, Link's progression is entirely dictated by gear: clothes for defense and weapons for attack power. A great weapon find is doubly precious for being temporary, so you won't want to waste its short life on weak enemies, and it's always good to have one or two lesser pieces on hand. Thus you're voluntarily scaling your power to the situation at hand, which makes you feel smart and still gives you a strong sense of advancement, without the deadening effect of a level-balancing set-up such as Skyrim's. (Plus, all the equipment looks really cool, and collecting and upgrading Link's outfits is quite compulsive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "885c27f5-841f-40bd-9c29-cc83edb8903d": {"__data__": {"id_": "885c27f5-841f-40bd-9c29-cc83edb8903d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "a482b21d-50aa-48d2-b9cc-93e99d811482", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f350364bd94f74180b9e54d92f1130061fecf43878d4e9b3bc5b8c11b05fd9e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "3196ceb5-4491-449d-a39f-0cda301ecf4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e583bfba2b5208532b2ea02c59edef2c7c8a26b7ecbd7fb65708e412de3d41f"}}, "hash": "524e2cbe027d6c4a88c037940dafbc63c82660c002abc81460bad03d56755b93", "text": ")What this all adds up to is superb sandbox game design, free of fiddle or bloat, unencumbered with preconceptions, and executed with the rock-solid reliability, tactile feedback and arcade brio for which Nintendo is justly celebrated. In other words: a total marvel.In case it isn't clear, this is a very different Legend of Zelda game. Until very recently, Nintendo has made its games in a bubble - not that this was necessarily a bad thing, as its priorities were unique, and its standards were uniquely high, but it seemed quite unconcerned by what other game makers were up to. Zelda, one of the most widely admired, finely honed and carefully iterated designs in gaming, was a bubble within this bubble. Its recurring plots about the hero in green echoed its well-worn, smooth patterns of play: get the boomerang, hookshot and bombs, do the dungeons, save the girl. It was a ritual incantation, a myth that ticked like clockwork.All that has been either swept aside or remade from first principles. It's hard to overstate the courage and conviction with which producer Eiji Aonuma, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and their team have rewritten their own work, and the size of the risk Nintendo has taken with a beloved property. Breath of the Wild isn't just the most radical departure from the Zelda tradition in its 30-year history, it's the first Nintendo game that feels like it was made in a world where Half-Life 2, Halo, Grand Theft Auto 3 and Skyrim happened. It's inspired by those greats and others, but it doesn't ape them any more than it rests on its own laurels. And if we're talking inspirations, we have to recognise one game above all others, an uncompromising adventure from 1986 that dared to take gaming off the rails, that put a whole world beyond the TV screen and invited the player to explore it: the original Legend of Zelda.\n        From Assassin's Creed to Zoo Tycoon, we welcome all gamers\n      \n        Eurogamer welcomes videogamers of all types, so sign in and join our community!\n      \nFind out how we conduct our reviews by reading our review policy.    \nFollow topics and we'll email you when we publish something new about them.\u00a0\n    \nWe'll send you an email whenever we (or one of our sister sites) publish an article on this topic.    \n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \n\nClose    \n\n\nYou can manage your preferences here      .\n    \nOli Welsh\n\n          Contributor\n        Oli was Eurogamer's MMO Editor before a seven-year stint as Editor.

In hindsight it wasn\u2019t entirely true - transition screens partitioned the mountain into chunks that wouldn\u2019t choke the N64 - but at the time: whoa. It was a moment so genre-defining that I\u2019m not sure Nintendo ever stepped out of that mountain\u2019s shadow. That\u2019s the curse of rewriting the rulebook - once the ecstasy of innovation has died down, it\u2019s just another template you\u2019re beholden to. Well, Breath of the Wild doesn\u2019t want to play by the rules.The rulebook isn\u2019t just torn up. It\u2019s crushed beneath boulders, burned in a forest inferno and struck by lightning. Science has arrived in Hyrule, a rush of freeform simulation that brings with it a spark of life that could never quite ignite in the hand-crafted worlds of old. This is a Hyrule where a sudden thunderstorm sees you desperately shed conductive metals before lightning turns you into a baked potato. A Hyrule where trees can be chopped and ridden down rapids as you snipe at unsuspecting goons on the riverbank. A Hyrule where volcanic air ignites the wooden blade in your grip and rain makes your hands slide like warm butter off cliff walls.But as Hyrule misbehaves, so Link can misbehave in it. Today\u2019s obsession is attaching inflatable octorok guts (think Metal Gear\u2019s Fulton balloons, but way, way grosser) to logs and clinging to the bark as I serenely float over the fields like the old guy in Up. Yesterday was all about trying to bring down helicopter sentries by starting grass fires and heaving bombs skywards by lobbing them into the resulting updraft.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d53e1314-bf81-46d2-b689-916a1a9958cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "d53e1314-bf81-46d2-b689-916a1a9958cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "3196ceb5-4491-449d-a39f-0cda301ecf4d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e583bfba2b5208532b2ea02c59edef2c7c8a26b7ecbd7fb65708e412de3d41f"}, "3": {"node_id": "74847297-9387-44a6-9e9f-2fd8741823b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ff24db20189d8036d0c7cab5d020dfa906bd194b377ee03de6cbf7182a0b70cb"}}, "hash": "14f6eec0e77fd18b64abbb38dc3d9a8847524ae304b555b0964fd3251b85851e", "text": "Every day I find time to use Link\u2019s metal-lifting magnesis power to pick up metal crates and thwack them into moblins. If luck is on my side there\u2019ll be storm too, turning my giant metal fist into a lightning rod. This is how you get kids into science.So much can happen in ten minutes of BOTW that it\u2019s tempting to slip into list mode. The way dropping meat by a dog earns you a loyal pal. Or that stealing a resting bokoblin\u2019s club leaves him empty-handed in a fight. I particularly love fighting in long grass and then retracing the path of the battle by where the greenery is trimmed. Nintendo always gives you great toys in Zelda games, but it\u2019s never let them collide and blend so freely. That it quickly hands over an infinite supply of bombs, your magnetic power and another ability to charge objects with kinetic energy (firing even the heaviest boulder like a golf ball) is a clear invitation to go wild.\u00a0Improvisation runs deep in Breath of the Wild. Not just in moment-to-moment goofing, but in a central quest that - after introducing some basics across a hemmed-in starting ground - pretty much leaves the rest to you. Calamity Ganon festers away in the centre of the map, and you\u2019re free to take a pop at him when you want. His army of superpowered mech bodyguards means you won\u2019t get far - I struggle with them after 40 hours - but that you\u2019re able to try shows a huge shift away from the maligned hand-holding of Skyward Sword. If anything, it exposes the older Hyrules a little (bar Wind Waker\u2019s glorious ocean) for the not-so-open worlds they are.\"For the Zelda team\u2019s first \u2018true\u2019 open world this is a staggering achievement\"The thrust of the game, then, is evening the odds - using all these wonderful new tools in creative ways, while kitting-out Link to a point where he won\u2019t get smushed to a paste. For many this will mean following the central quest line. You know the deal: find the dungeon, do the dungeon, earn a power to assist in the final assault. These segments are more traditional than the game around them, but are storming mini-adventures in themselves. One of the things Skyward Sword really got right was dragging larger action beats and puzzles out into the overworld - with its vast open canvas, Breath of the Wild supercharges this idea. It\u2019s hard to name another open world game that so seamlessly slips between set-piece and sandbox.Even these linear scenes are open to interpretation, with key destinations you can tackle in any order. If you were to stick to the story you\u2019d only visit half the regions available on the map, and see only a sliver of those to boot. It\u2019s in pushing into untouched territories, solving their mysteries to unlock their artefacts, that you can carve your own route to the final boss. If this involves tanking your way to Ganon with 100 bomb arrows and a knapsack packed with health-restoring steaks, then so be it. That this is the first Zelda you can win by exploiting barbecued meats is a glorious thing. Here\u2019s hoping I eventually find a chest containing some Rennie.For the Zelda team\u2019s first \u2018true\u2019 open world this is a staggering achievement. It collaborated with Monolith Soft, makers of Xenoblade Chronicles, and the resulting world comes as no surprise. Bionis\u2019 towering architecture is a clear touchstone for Hyrule, from the vast stone mushrooms of the Thundra Plateau to the surprise arrival of a tropical paradise nesting behind seemingly barren cliffs. It manages the difficult trick of giving you the broad strokes of the epic - the mountainous skyline, 300 foot waterfalls, the odd ribcage of some continent-sized beast - but, unlike Xenoblade, delivers nuance up close.\u00a0This might mean rare horses to creep up on and grab - getting a hoof in the gob for a clumsy approach - or a vast array of foxes, storks and goats to turn into tomorrow\u2019s lunchbox. Just the sensation of standing in wafting grass is pleasant enough to wile away a few minutes. Then it\u2019s time to whistle for your steed and gallop towards the next treehouse or skull-shaped caved poking out from the ocean of green.

Diligent exploration uncovers Shrines, containing a room or two of dungeon puzzling that didn\u2019t find a home elsewhere. On that note, while some may feel the \u2018proper\u2019 dungeon count a little low, and their size a little small, the many dozens (possibly hundreds) of Shrines make this the most puzzle-stuffed Zelda yet. Your brain certainly doesn\u2019t come out the other side feeling undernourished.A mixture of praise and reservation: here's what the world's critics think of Nintendo's new consoleMore than this, Hyrule never slips into tick \u2019em off chores popularised by Far Cry or Assassin\u2019s Creed. Where you find people, you find side quests with meaningful rewards. Where you spot intriguing landmarks, you find ancient riddles to untangle. Everything that falls in between is exploring for exploration's sake; the thrill of cresting a mountaintop, or gliding into the dark crevice below. In a delightful touch there are hundreds of Koroks - Wind Waker\u2019s forest people - hiding across the world, many on lonely peaks who exist just to let you know that yes, Nintendo knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to resist climbing up. Here\u2019s a reward. Nice view, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0Climbing is Breath of the Wild\u2019s secret weapon. Scrambling up surfaces makes you intensely aware of the world above you and invites designers to hide secrets in the weirdest places. More than this, the use of a quickly draining stamina meter transforms every surface into a puzzle. As you plot snaking routes up daunting cliffs you wonder if you\u2019ve got the grip to make it between footholds. Could the paraglider bridge that peak and that plateau? Will it rain halfway up and doom the expedition? After years of glitching Geralt and Dovahkiin up mountains they were never meant to climb, Link\u2019s flexibility is a revelation.In fact, throughout Breath of the Wild you sense Nintendo gleefully taking apart action-RPG conventions. Defining Link\u2019s stats by equipment rather than levelling is smart, as you\u2019re only as strong as the goods you carry. One lucky find - a rare halberd with 20 points more damage and added durability, say - can give you the foothold you\u2019ve been looking for in an area with harder enemies. Then you have to contend with weapon degradation, asking you to really cherish what you have and master whatever ends up in your hands. That could be a bladed boomerang (in a great touch you have to catch them with a timed button prod); it could be, and for me often was, a broom or soup ladle.If a soup ladle won\u2019t give the Master Sword any restless nights, it does at least reflect Link\u2019s new culinary bent. With health-replenishing hearts removed from the world you depend on cooking to whip up healing meals and buffs. It adds a hint of the survival sandbox, but is never so intrusive that it brings that genre\u2019s misery. Take the heat gauge, for example. Link chugs elixirs to endure extreme hot or cold, but once in those regions you will soon find clothing that negates those concerns. It asks you to do just enough to prove you have the survival chops, but refuses to let stress get in the way of the fun. It\u2019s a beautiful Nintendo take on a mechanic that so easily becomes a chore elsewhere.As a long-term fan, it\u2019s a treat to see Nintendo take its gift for problem solving outside of the Zelda comfort zone - a place the series has arguably inhabited since Ocarina of Time. Not since that game\u2019s leap to 3D and introduction of lock-on targeting has a Zelda game made this many breakthroughs. More than that, by going open-world, Nintendo is working in a genre that\u2019s so often flawed; the sheer ambition of creating an entire continent helps you overlook any filler within it. Breath of the Wild isn\u2019t perfect - the right combo of visual effects can hurt the frame rate in a way that is rare in Nintendo\u2019s first party efforts - but it asks you to forgive far fewer rough edges compared to its peers.The best surprise? For all it challenges Zelda\u2019s rules, there is never any doubt which gaming universe you are in. A stoic, silent hero. Musical themes that whisk you back to where you first heard them.

What a familiar feeling to look across Hyrule Field at Death Mountain, wondering what it would be like to climb it. What a profound thrill to make that journey in its entirety. It has taken 18 years, but Nintendo has done it again: this is the adventure game to beat.This game was reviewed on Nintendo Switch.P.S.

England and Wales company registration number 2008885. \nMetro GameCentral, Nintendo\u2019s highly-anticipated new adventure is finally here, but is it reason alone to buy the new Switch console?Ocarina Of Time may have been the best thing to ever happen to gaming, but it\u2019s long seemed a curse to The Legend Of Zelda series. Whereas the Super Mario games have happily reinvented themselves with each major sequel, Zelda has wilted under the shadow of what many still proclaim to be the best game ever made.That\u2019s not to say many of the Zelda games released since haven\u2019t been good, but they\u2019ve struggled to either match Ocarina Of Time or find a way to reinvent its formula. Breath Of The Wild does both.Although we still consider it the best of the post-N64 home console games, the reputation of 2011\u2019s Skyward Sword has sunk considerably over the years \u2013 with fans, with critics, and seemingly with Nintendo themselves.But its failings seem to be the driving force behind Breath Of The Wild\u2019s changes, which is surprising considering both games share the same producer and director. Where Skyward Sword was criticised for its poor pacing and restrictive environments, Breath Of The Wild luxuriates in one of the largest and most intricately detailed open world landscapes ever seen.And while Skyward Sword took painful long hours to get going, Breath Of The Wild has you out fending for yourself in mere minutes.Although it seems impossible that a modern title could take any useful inspiration from a 31-year-old NES game the influence of the original The Legend Of Zelda is surprisingly obvious, as you\u2019re thrust out on your quest with the very minimum of instruction \u2013 free to go where you like, and defend against extremely dangerous enemies, from the very start.The Zelda games have always resisted easy categorisation but Breath Of The Wild more so than ever. It\u2019s the closest the series has come to being a true role-playing game since Zelda II, but it also owes a strong influence to survival games.Link still doesn\u2019t have any stats but his three-piece outfits do, and so do the weapons, armour, and shields he picks up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "193b86a7-9234-4aac-9ff1-7507899ed598": {"__data__": {"id_": "193b86a7-9234-4aac-9ff1-7507899ed598", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa08cf41-9a4a-4bd0-8c7b-c64088307fa9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e685490248232f6509895b5321ca37313eab923ee3d74c32ce2c81f165fae87"}, "3": {"node_id": "eedbb39c-1137-46fe-8b0d-5d23f11735e3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "26f662e6da06d3974a01a3eeaefa91a65eb09a1193f481e260d9b06a9ea1d395"}}, "hash": "0795801c708f73582f4b2e587f8b59248c01f41af42952e5afc0c7b91eda3f55", "text": "The outfits can be upgraded but the equipment has an extremely short half-life before it breaks, and cannot be repaired.Breakable weapons are not usually a favourite mechanic of ours, but here it\u2019s used much more effectively than usual \u2013 to emphasise Link\u2019s vulnerability and to force experimentation with the vast array of equipment.From swords and two-handed spears to boomerangs that you have to catch and a variety of elemental wands, the range is hugely impressive and all handled by an elegantly simple control system.Fundamentally it\u2019s not very different to Ocarina Of Time, and still uses Z-targeting, but dodging or parrying at the right time opens up enemies to more powerful attacks, adding an extra layer of tactics. Meanwhile, firing your bow requires considerable skill and judgement to get the arc of the arrow\u2019s flight on target.We found the latter surprising at first, but Breath Of The Wild features not just a robust physics engine but an unexpectedly realistic approach to most of its mechanics.Climbing becomes more difficult in the rain, and there are optional on-screen meters to measure both the temperature (you grow exhausted in the heat or freeze in the cold) and the amount of noise you\u2019re making.Even the artificial intelligence is remarkably good, as monsters gang up and retreat when necessary, or know to pick up dropped weapons. They\u2019ll kick away unexploded bombs and throw explosive barrels \u2013 or even smaller monsters if they\u2019re one of the bigger enemies.Set off a bomb in the water and fish will come flying out, while a magic ability lets you pick up metallic objects and throw them around like a wrecking ball. You can create balloon bombs to send floating into an enemy camp, sneak in at night and steal their weapons so it doesn\u2019t matter if they raise an alarm, or use the call for your horse to distract guards.Everything works as it should in the real world, from metal items conducting electricity (put your sword away in a thunderstorm!) to the pull of gravity on every object, and all of this is used in both combat and pre-designed puzzles.Breath Of The Wild is not just different mechanically from previous games but structurally too. There\u2019s no preset path and the main thrust of your quest involves completing a task in each of the four corners of the map, which can be done in any order.Alan Wake 2 review - go back to sleepNew Nintendo Switch OLED and Mario Kart bundle is \u00a350 off reveals leakWeekend Hot Topic: The scariest non-horror video gamesYou\u2019re not told what you have to do for each of them or even specifically where to go, and it\u2019s so easy to get sidetracked with other things that it was over 20 hours before we even started to think about tackling one of them. And that was us in a hurry to get this review done.The main quest does involve a small number of what are essentially traditional Zelda style dungeons. But they\u2019re shorter than normal and, apart from boss battles, focused almost entirely on puzzle solving.This is clearly to stop the problem in previous Zeldas where the overworld felt merely like an insubstantial interlude between each dungeon. But it also gives the designers an excuse to up the difficulty and to add in 120 optional shrines.Finding a shrine creates a fast travel point but completing it rewards you with an item which can go toward increasing your maximum health or stamina.Shrines vary considerably in difficulty and focus, with many different puzzle styles and some that are based around combat or platforming. There\u2019s always an extra chest with a valuable item too, for that extra challenge.The other major gameplay element is the resource-gathering and crafting.There are no hearts to restore your health and instead you have to collect plants and hunt animals (although the latter isn\u2019t mandatory) to cook meals or potions that not only restore health but add buffs such as heat resistance or increased attack power.This almost seems like a game in itself, as you collect the ingredients to make everything from a mushroom salad to a fruit loaf. If you\u2019re not interested then basic recipes take only seconds to make, but the whole feature is a useful way to unwind between quests and consider the strategy of your next move.As usual in Zelda the story is very minimal. But it begins with Link waking from a century-long sleep and takes a surprisingly maudlin tone during the occasional cut scenes.The formal storytelling still only takes up a tiny percentage of the whole game, but for arguably the first time Link and Zelda are portrayed as real characters, even if the former remains entirely mute.Most of the dialogue is still plain text but the most important sequences do feature proper voiceovers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eedbb39c-1137-46fe-8b0d-5d23f11735e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "eedbb39c-1137-46fe-8b0d-5d23f11735e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "193b86a7-9234-4aac-9ff1-7507899ed598", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0795801c708f73582f4b2e587f8b59248c01f41af42952e5afc0c7b91eda3f55"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca3ce0af-7dd3-4ed1-b20d-49d9513d8936", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "17f5c7e3fbe188c9c332602efe2f45e6474655ead04c3791f58c66ad285b6ce7"}}, "hash": "26f662e6da06d3974a01a3eeaefa91a65eb09a1193f481e260d9b06a9ea1d395", "text": "The acting is not always great, but the mix of styles works well enough.By now we\u2019ve outlined the basics of what Breath Of The Wild is and how it works, but we\u2019ve still only scratched the surface of why we think it\u2019s one of the best games ever made.To put things dispassionately it\u2019s the level of detail and flexibility the game world offers. But the way that manifests is through the countless unforeseeable events and stories that lie around every corner. From your first falling to star to spotting smoke signals in the distance and wondering who they\u2019re from, the game has an almost infinite capacity to surprise and delight.Breath Of The Wild provides an endless stream of incidental moments that stick in the mind, like exchanging words with a desert-dwelling Gerudo woman as she runs through the rain looking for shelter, appalled at the unfamiliar climate of a forested area.Or stumbling across a party of horseback-riding monsters as they hunt, then stealing one of their horses, breaking it in and taking it back to a stable where you can examine its stats and name it if you decide to keep it.The open world manages to seem like a vast sandbox and an intricately designed puzzle all at the same time. There\u2019s something new to see and do at almost every step and yet somehow the game is able to have its cake and eat it: giving the impression you\u2019re exploring untouched wilderness, that no-one but you has ever laid eyes on, and yet also a landscape where every tree and boulder has been placed with the utmost care and forethought.None of this should necessarily be seen as a validation of the Nintendo Switch though. Breath Of The Wild was originally designed for the Wii U and the only difference between the two versions is slightly improved performance and resolution on the Switch.Breath Of The Wild can be a stunning-looking game at time, with some excellent lighting techniques, but it\u2019s also filled with some very simple textures and geometry; which become more obvious the less vegetation there is around. Although how much that is due to the Wii U origins is impossible to say at this point.There are also some very minor frame rate issues, although our only real complaint about the graphics is the desaturated colour scheme. The effect varies depending on the time of day and weather but at its worst it made us pine for the more sumptuous colours of Skyward Sword.And while some may be taken aback by the understated soundtrack, it sensibly keeps itself in check until moments of high tension and mixes perfectly with the ambient noises of the world around you.Finding fault with Breath Of The Wild is almost the hardest task in the whole game (almost, since it is surprisingly difficult and the game over screen will become a constant companion until you find your feet).The new Zelda is an outstanding achievement in video game design, even by the standards of the franchise. But the size and scope of the adventure, and the freedom you\u2019re given to create your own stories and cherished memories, makes this the best Zelda there\u2019s ever been.And that\u2019s no small compliment, because that immediately confirms it as one of the best games ever made. Only hindsight will be able to decide whether it\u2019s literally the best, but this not only breathes new life into series, and Nintendo\u2019s new console, but into future expectations for all video games to come.In Short: The best Zelda there\u2019s ever been, and very possibly the best video game ever made.Pros: Incredible attention to detail and interactivity at every level, from the massive open world to the exciting combat, intricate puzzles, clever AI, and charming dialogue.Cons: Desaturated colour scheme can spoil the look of the visuals.

This is not the Zelda we\u2019re familiar with, but my hesitations about deviating from a proven formula were cast aside the moment I was dropped into the new, open Hyrule.Breath of the Wild\u2019s version of Hyrule is consistently compelling and full of discovery and reward. The sections of the world are thoughtfully designed, each an important part of the larger whole. Every trail I took, even the ones off the beaten path, led to interesting discoveries like hidden puzzles, new weapons, and strange architecture. Link\u2019s map is blank at the start, meant to be filled with icons as you decide which activities to pursue, and I appreciate that it lets me define what is important.\n\u00a0\nPlayers are accustomed to navigating open worlds, but Link\u2019s ability to climb leads to unprecedented levels of exploratory freedom. If you see something in the distance, you can walk or fly straight to it, regardless of what\u2019s in your path. Link never needs to circumnavigate. Every surface in Hyrule is an opportunity to further your adventure. Gigantic statues you might think are set-dressing are used as platforms to kick-start a flight. Mountains normally used to create barriers are climbing challenges; your reward for these tests of endurance might be a new item, but even just a new view of Hyrule can be equally valuable. I never tired of climbing toward the skies, looking out into the world, and seeing all it had to offer in detail.Breath of the Wild is more than just a world of beautiful scenery. It\u2019s full of puzzle shrines, dungeons, and surprises. The main dungeons are smaller than those in previous Zeldas, but benefit from the compact design by never overstaying their welcome. Link takes control of each of the dungeons, rotating them to solve puzzles, or manipulating their large components to open new paths. Defeating their challenging bosses offers worthwhile rewards that affect facets of exploration and combat in exciting ways, like the ability to perform an extra powerful attack in times of need. Any disappointment that may have resulted from the main dungeons being smaller affairs is cleanly washed away thanks to the myriad shrines.Shrines are found throughout the world, and along with each offering physical rewards they also act as unlockable fast-travel points, making each one invaluable. They all feel distinct, focusing on singular puzzle ideas and executing on them with few repeated mechanics. They are well-designed, taking full advantage of Link\u2019s new time-manipulation and magnetic abilities, but also use familiar Zelda ideas, like bombs, in novel ways. The shrines are home to the most creative puzzles, and they stand comfortably alongside the best of the larger franchise.The challenges of the game extend beyond solving puzzles and apply directly to Link\u2019s survival. Breath of the Wild is not an easy game. It begins with Link waking after being asleep for 100 years, and he is quickly dropped into the world with little tutorial. Preparation is key when deciding the direction to go; the whole world is accessible, but that doesn\u2019t mean you are equipped to handle every area. Approaching the volcano without a collection of fireproof potions results in a fiery death, and not wearing the right clothes as you head north makes the frost steal your hearts. Checkpoints are friendly though, and being able to fast-travel to any shrine (even in the middle of a fight) means you can always escape danger. Despite dying often, the difficulty of the game is reasonable, and incredibly rewarding when the preparation pays off.An important part of that preparation is equipping Link with food and weapons, which are found everywhere. Creating health-restoring dishes and potions is simple, and I enjoyed gathering ingredients between destinations to see what I could create. Combining meats and mushrooms to create heart-replenishing shish kabobs is fun, but discovering strange potions using monster parts and bugs is especially exciting.I was never at a loss for sword, bow, or shield, but the item degradation prevents players from being precious about Link\u2019s weapons. Using a sword to the breaking point and throwing it at an enemy for one final destructive blow feels good, but it always stung a little to chuck something I liked. More powerful weapons are always nearby, but the degradation mechanic is ultimately one I just learned to cope with.Surviving in the world serves as an important build-up to the ultimate goal, which is defined early on: Defeat Ganon. In Breath of the Wild, Link is not trying to prevent the villain\u2019s resurrection. Ganon is there the moment Link wakes, visible in the distance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5858b9b-2c58-4a4a-9d41-b684700b84dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5858b9b-2c58-4a4a-9d41-b684700b84dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca3ce0af-7dd3-4ed1-b20d-49d9513d8936", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "17f5c7e3fbe188c9c332602efe2f45e6474655ead04c3791f58c66ad285b6ce7"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9881419-4a7c-436b-b86a-944150fc29e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "150d115adb64ae4b7fb9e65131dbb3fcb38576b186b755fda9f1ce82a74516dc"}}, "hash": "fbc6ab11e39aa8f6a8bffcfd8e11b291987db828fef5c4fb517ce2962699796d", "text": "Ganon is there the moment Link wakes, visible in the distance. His evil presence is clear from nearly every vantage point on the map as a disturbing, glowing evil and it has a tangible effect on the world. I felt it at every moment, whether it was by seeing Ganon in the distance or by talking to Hyrulians living under his oppression. Seeing the goal from the moment I started the game also made my final sprint to defeat Ganon hugely rewarding. When I finally decided I was ready to face Ganon, it felt like the culmination of a lifetime of preparation that ended with a hugely satisfying finale.The rest of the story is simple, familiar to even those who have never played a Zelda game, but the way it is presented is interesting, calling into question the familiar fate of Link and Zelda in a way that made me sympathize with the struggling heroes (in spite of the underwhelming voice performances of Zelda and the supporting cast). Their mission is harder than it has been in previous Zelda games, and the pressure of that task is told well through the optional cutscenes.Breath of the Wild is an achievement in the design of a living world. Hyrule is massive, with multiple environmental systems layered on top of a grand adventure. The only technical issue I encountered was one related to the framerate when fighting multiple enemies in busy forests. Despite the massive scope of the game, Breath of the Wild retains Nintendo\u2019s knack for polish without any major technical hiccups to disrupt the experience. I was entranced by this version of Hyrule, and it surprised me at nearly every turn, from its wealth of discoveries to the way it shuns the established tropes of previous Zelda games. It represents a profound new direction for one of gaming\u2019s best franchises and a new high point for open-world interactive experiences.This review pertains to the Switch version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

All Rights Reserved.\nGameSpot, A breathtaking masterpiece.By \n    Peter Brown\n   on March 6, 2017 at 3:10PM PSTFrom its mysterious opening to its action-packed conclusion, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a revolution for Nintendo's revered series. It's both a return to form and a leap into uncharted territory, and it exceeds expectations on both fronts. The game takes designs and mechanics perfected in other games and reworks them for its own purposes to create something wholly new, but also something that still feels quintessentially like a Zelda game. It's a truly magical work of art that embodies Nintendo's unique talents, and a game that everyone should play regardless of their affinity for the series' past.More than a typical Hyrule fantasy, Breath of the Wild is a daunting survival game that forces you to think in entirely new ways. You have to be cautious, creative, and resourceful in your efforts to battle the wilderness. Outside of armor, you have to source everything from the field. You earn new weapons by stealing from enemies and prepare restorative meals and elixirs by combining resources found in the environment. Death comes quickly, and whether it's at the hand of a formidable enemy or because you charged unprepared down a treacherous path, you're forced to reconsider almost everything you've learned from past Zelda games. There's so much to see, to accomplish, and to learn that you never feel like you have control over the world. This is a great thing.

When he trots to the edge of a cliff and the new, massive Hyrule comes into view, you're faced with the striking scale of the world, which is by far the largest the series has ever seen.

However, it doesn't take long to build up a diverse arsenal. Nearly every enemy carries a weapon or a shield, and if you can beat them, their gear is yours for the taking. This is also a godsend given that every weapon has finite durability. You will blow through dozens if not hundreds of weapons during your adventure, which no doubt feels strange at first, especially since gear often defined your progress in previous Zelda games. It can feel crushing when a particularly cool weapon is destroyed mid-battle, but you learn to move on. There's no shortage of new gear to discover, and though you aren't able to utilize a consistent stable of familiar weapons, you learn to expect that for every one you've lost, there's something better coming down the road.In practice, the weapon you wield is important but not necessarily as important as how you control it. Enemies are intelligent and utilize wildly different tactics that force you to diligently study every aspect of their behavior. Basic enemies can be toppled through careful use of a shield, but there are harder enemies that will destroy this defense in a single hit. In these cases, it\u2019s imperative that you parry or dodge an attack at just the right time, which will trigger a moment of slow-motion that allows you to unleash a flurry of attacks against your vulnerable foe. These moves are your last line of defense when the going gets tough, and they require precise timing to execute. Given the myriad enemies and weapons you're up against, mastery feels almost unattainable even with substantial practice. However, that also means you are constantly learning in the face of unforeseen challenges.There are innumerable unexpected events that can happen. The game never teaches you, for example, that holstering your shield after blocking enemy arrows will add them to your inventory. You're never told that grazing an enemy's wooden weapon with a fire arrow by accident will set it ablaze, thus making the fight harder for you in the long run. These occurrences fuel exciting stories between players, which feels like a rarity in a world where games go so far out of the way to ensure that you know how everything works. Even 50 hours in--and after you're capable of bringing down Ganon--there are still intimidating enemies to be found and intricate rules to study. Your power and wisdom grow as you progress, but you never feel totally invincible, which allows even late-game exploration to be feel tense and rewarding.Beyond weaponry, Link gains access to magical skills known as runes. These include the ability to move metallic objects with a magical tether, which can be useful for, among other tricks, dropping large iron boxes on unsuspecting enemies. Link can also freeze enemies and objects in place for a limited amount of time. When an object is frozen, it absorbs energy rather than reacting immediately to whatever force you lay into it. And when time unfreezes, all that collected force is exerted in an instant. This allows you to move objects that are otherwise too heavy for Link to control, and gives you a chance to strike a defenseless enemy multiple times without fear of reprisal. Runes prove to be a wonderful source of creativity and problem solving, both in combat and when managing puzzles.The game's four main dungeons are primarily puzzle focused, with only a few enemies sprinkled throughout. They are a bit unusual compared to dungeons in past Zelda games in that you aren't focused on finding keys to open doors. Instead, the goal is to manipulate the dungeon itself, to literally change its form in order to access important areas. It's a wonderful break from tradition, while you still get a challenging boss battle to look forward to at the end. Gone are the oddly charming bosses from Zelda's past; they've been replaced with dark and twisted fiends that are powerful combatants. Like your fights against normal enemies, you have to move and act deliberately, or suffer for your cockiness.Breath of the Wild's big dungeons are important, but they are almost less of a draw than the smaller shrines that dot the world. There are reportedly 100 of these mini-dungeons strewn across the map, and the vast majority of them feature puzzles that test your understanding and mastery of Link's rune abilities. Some can be completed in a few minutes, but there are plenty more containing extensive, multi-step processes. Compared to roughing it in nature, these brain teasers are an excellent respite, and make great use of Breath of the Wild's impressive physics system. Figuring out what to do is only half the battle. The rest comes down to precise execution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "717909f3-a9dc-493b-a250-936f2dc5257e": {"__data__": {"id_": "717909f3-a9dc-493b-a250-936f2dc5257e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9881419-4a7c-436b-b86a-944150fc29e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "150d115adb64ae4b7fb9e65131dbb3fcb38576b186b755fda9f1ce82a74516dc"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb6c49b8-1178-4405-9496-63a61491464d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "eb3f56d19148e9f229a2951f1edefce2ac8fe9d85af4e78fb42e630c0485151b"}}, "hash": "7e7198034816ccd283f0168193eedab10c1b9091d2777e136e491cfa117d3e31", "text": "The rest comes down to precise execution. Therefore, solving even simple puzzles can feel immensely rewarding.When you look across Hyrule in search of your next destination, the faint orange glow of a new shrine is difficult to ignore. They are one of many distractions that cause you to veer off track. Seeking them out won't help you complete the game any faster--not that you should rush through Breath of the Wild in the first place--but they are rewarding opportunities that expose you to the far corners of Hyrule, where you often catch whiffs of something new and mysterious laying in wait.Somewhat surprisingly, exploration often proves far more challenging than combat or puzzle solving. Link travels primarily on foot, and he can sprint as long as his stamina meter allows before having to catch his breath. Link can also climb vertical surfaces like cliffs and walls now, but again, he's at the mercy of his physical strength. Exploration may be a struggle at times due to Link's limitations and harsh weather that hinders his capabilities, but to avoid long treks is to rob yourself of some of the best moments of discovery in Breath of the Wild, and the sense of satisfaction you feel for overcoming its most foreboding environments. Equipping metal weapons and armor will turn Link into a veritable lightning rod, and if you're climbing a mountain when it starts to rain, you won't be able to climb more than a few feet before losing your grip and sliding back down. Bring a wooden shield to the fiery slopes of Mount Eldin, and watch it set ablaze on your back while Link's health slowly slips away.Hyrule is a beautiful world to behold from the top of a mountain, but perching Link on high has other benefits. In addition to runes, Link obtains a paraglider early on in the game, which he then carries with him at all times. It's useful when you fall off a tall building or cliff, but it's also a source of levity after taxing fights and daunting hikes. Your reward for scaling a mountain or tower is the opportunity to soar through the sky and cross large tracts of land with your glider. And if you're skillful, you can use your shield as a veritable snowboard to glide down grassy hills and frozen slopes. Granted, Link can surf down hills at any time as long as his shield can handle the wear and tear, but it\u2019s especially gratifying to drop onto a slope after flying over a massive canyon or a dense forest and coast into a town in style.The few towns that exist in the new Hyrule mimic the understated and rural qualities seen in Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke. Equally charming are the hikers you meet on trails. These lonely yet upbeat adventurers offer humorous quips, or perhaps a side quest with a quirky premise. You spend so much time fighting to survive, all while under the cloud of your impending fight with the dark and powerful Ganon. By contrast, your interactions with NPCs are opportunities to slow down and help out a friendly stranger in need. Though you have an overarching goal in mind, Breath of the Wild's delightful distractions often prove to be its most memorable moments.If you've ever hiked deep into the wilderness and found yourself awash in wonderment and perhaps guilt for living a life steeped in modern indulgences, Breath of the Wild's reverence for the natural world will strike a chord. It's the way the rising sun graces blades of grass as you climb a steep hill. It's the flutter of a few well-timed piano notes that dance in your ear and harmonize with your internal childlike amazement. And it's the unwavering delight and excitement that each new discovery brings. It can come when you reveal a new portion of the world map and find a curious landmark, but there's an almost endless stream of smaller discoveries to make as you move about Hyrule.No matter how gorgeous its environments are, how clever its enemies are, and how tricky its puzzles get, the fact that Breath of the Wild continues to surprise you with newfound rules and possibilities after dozens of hours is by far its most valuable quality. It's a game that allows you to feel gradually more and more empowered yet simultaneously manages to retain a sense of challenge and mystery--which, together, creates a steady, consistent feeling of gratification throughout the entire experience. Breath of the Wild is a defining moment for The Legend of Zelda series, and the most impressive game Nintendo has ever created.Use your keyboard!Log in to comment\nPolygon, Filed under:[Ed. note: Portions of this review previously appeared in our pre-review for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

Sure, each game had its own twist \u2014 a dark world, lycanthropy, sailing, flight \u2014 but there was a predictable path for each. It was a familiar loop, and a successful one, given the series\u2019 regard.Somewhere in the transition from the overhead perspective of the 8- and 16-bit Zelda titles to the third dimension added with the Nintendo 64\u2019s Ocarina of Time, Nintendo seemed to lose faith in players\u2019 ability to figure things out. One of the worst offenders: relentless, unskippable introductory sections that could drag on for hours as each game made absolutely sure you understood how to play it \u2014 by having you perform the same basic mechanical tasks in numerous mundane ways.But five and a half years since 2011\u2019s Skyward Sword, Nintendo apparently rediscovered that faith.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the biggest, most open Zelda game ever made, but it also brings with it a massive change in design philosophy, and the way it treats players. Breath of the Wild is the first main Zelda title since 1991 (2013\u2019s Link to the Past sequel A Link Between Worlds notwithstanding) to feel like it respects its players implicitly.In return, Breath of the Wild demands your respect. And if you forget that for longer than a few minutes, it\u2019ll remind you by knocking you flat on your ass.Breath of the Wild isn\u2019t without some of the same basic Zelda foundation. You play as Link, the hero of fantasy world Hyrule, though what that means and who Link is differs from previous games somewhat (as it does in every Zelda game). The story opens as a confused Link awakens to a world he doesn\u2019t recognize. Mystery is everywhere, from the hint of hyper-advanced fantasy technology to the evidence all around of a disastrous, society-ending war.The narrative setup is more or less perfect for a Zelda game, because it provides just enough familiarity to feel like it\u2019s supposed to for old fans, and leaves enough holes to instill a real sense of mystery. Link moves through the world like a ghost, and it suits the voiceless character well.New spins on familiar Zelda archetypes are typical from game to game, but Nintendo\u2019s EPD team has also retooled many of the basic character tropes and ideas that have remained a constant for the series\u2019 existence. There are character relationships at work that are not what you expect, and I was genuinely surprised by a number of implied stories and relationships. I expect Breath of the Wild\u2019s narrative and character departures from Zelda precedent to stir at least some amount of controversy, which is mostly a good thing.All of this is painted in the most sophisticated visual style and presentation Zelda has ever seen. The Wind Waker and Skyward Sword were striking in their own ways, but Breath of the Wild is their clear culmination. It is a frequently stunning, consistently striking visual achievement, evocative of legendary Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli\u2019s films in a way that seems lovingly influenced rather than derivative. It also happens to include some of the best, most varied music the series has ever had, and, for the first time in a Zelda game, voice acting for a number of characters.In all likelihood, Nintendo could have made a traditional Zelda game with Breath of the Wild\u2019s art direction and production values and received the biggest accolades the series has seen since 1998\u2019s Ocarina of Time. It looks that good.Of course, that isn\u2019t the game Nintendo made.If you\u2019ve played any previous Zelda game, the following statement should rock you on your heels: Every mission-critical tool and item in Breath of the Wild is obtained within the first hour or two of play in an expanded sandbox that acts as a tutorial without mindless compulsory tasks.Breath of the Wild\u2019s various locations are gated behind specific kinds of equipment less than in any other third-person Zelda game. The geographic options in front of me felt almost overwhelming right from the start, and that was just in the opening space. Once you obtain a specific item that allows you to leave that plateau, Hyrule is your oyster.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cad22dcc-85b4-4966-a026-92e3f5af8738": {"__data__": {"id_": "cad22dcc-85b4-4966-a026-92e3f5af8738", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb6c49b8-1178-4405-9496-63a61491464d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "eb3f56d19148e9f229a2951f1edefce2ac8fe9d85af4e78fb42e630c0485151b"}, "3": {"node_id": "01bec167-cc09-477b-bb82-6d7125daa6f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ad1934d11f0caa2bf9864c180fdce0c29e0959add4cf7c5b583fd988e9c61ec"}}, "hash": "743c5fed1db28fd12869e3f1b72e8f3899e2e5fdc125cbe33d1d0897abfe0ae2", "text": "It just happens to be an oyster full of really angry monsters and ancient death machines that will murder you if they see you.Breath of the Wild is, without question or debate, the hardest Zelda game of the last 20 years. The first 20 minutes or so are pretty low-key \u2014 you can kill the scrub Bokoblins and other minor enemies you meet without much trouble, using nothing more than a tree branch picked up off the ground. But once you leave the initial learning spaces and venture into more typical zones, you\u2019re probably going to die.You\u2019re probably going to die a lot, honestly. Often without much warning. Or at least I did.Often, the only indication Breath of the Wild might give that you are under-equipped for the space you\u2019re in is an enemy taking you from, say, six hearts to a quarter of one in a single axe swipe or spear lunge (assuming, you know, they don\u2019t just kill you outright). Or, like I said, they\u2019ll just kill you with no real fanfare or warning, and the game will reload you fairly close to where you were, with you hopefully having learned an important lesson about Hyrule\u2019s ecosystem and its desire for you not to exist in it.Comparisons to games like Dark Souls are probably inevitable, but they\u2019re not exactly fair. You don\u2019t lose anything when you die, other than the time lost getting back to where you were. You do have to contend with equipment with a finite life span, however, and resources will often be scarce unless you gather ingredients to make potions and meals.A side note: While I wholeheartedly approve of Breath of the Wild getting out of its own way immediately, I really would have appreciated any tutorial whatsoever on cooking, something the game doesn\u2019t care to elaborate on in any meaningful way until well into the experience.Cooking and crafting is something I\u2019ve typically avoided in open-world action RPGs in the last several years; I find this kind of thing incredibly boring. But for whatever reason, cooking and mixing in Breath of the Wild feels a little more loose and a little more immediately rewarding, and, well, it\u2019s an absolute necessity.There\u2019s a practical reason for this. While spaces in Breath of the Wild aren\u2019t item-gated, exactly, aside from the aforementioned enemies that will smash you, they can be beyond your physical capabilities. While Link is physically capable \u2014 he can climb most walls and use a sort of hang glider, and he can swim right away, no items required \u2014 more strenuous activity depletes Link\u2019s limited stamina bar. However, if you cook the right things together, you can create meals and elixirs that, say, refill your stamina completely, or even give you temporary extra stamina that might allow you to reach a spot you otherwise couldn\u2019t.Also, if you don\u2019t make meals that give you more than a heart or two back \u2014 or, eventually, that give you bonus temporary hearts \u2014 you\u2019re not going to survive against more powerful common enemies you\u2019ll find out in the world.At first, this all feels like a lot to keep track of and consider while playing a Zelda game, but it quickly became second nature for me. And it all ties into the first idea I talked about above: that Breath of the Wild feels like the first third-person, big-budget Zelda game to eschew a meandering, elaborate, incredibly extended tutorial section. Breath of the Wild teaches you to play it, don\u2019t get me wrong. The plateau you start on gives you the powers and abilities you\u2019ll use for much of the game\u2019s puzzle solving via shrines, and each shrine is a series of instructional scenarios for a particular ability. But you can also screw around and kill Bokoblins and climb and explore the area to your heart\u2019s content, if that\u2019s what you want to do, and you could spend hours doing it before you left for the rest of Hyrule.That respect radiates outward. The puzzle logic in Breath of the Wild feels legitimately logical, and smartly physics-based. There are optional shrines scattered throughout Hyrule that act as mini puzzle dungeons, and almost without exception, they\u2019ve all been a lot of fun to figure out. By the end of most Zelda games, I\u2019ve felt that the game had just about exhausted its ideas for puzzles and dungeons. After solving 50 shrines over 60-70 hours in Breath of the Wild, I\u2019m still looking for more.Shrines aren\u2019t the only place where Breath of the Wild invites quick thinking.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01bec167-cc09-477b-bb82-6d7125daa6f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "01bec167-cc09-477b-bb82-6d7125daa6f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "cad22dcc-85b4-4966-a026-92e3f5af8738", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "743c5fed1db28fd12869e3f1b72e8f3899e2e5fdc125cbe33d1d0897abfe0ae2"}, "3": {"node_id": "8567df77-9436-4bc4-a3d6-caf6ac4abfbd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5f04b4b76b0b98e6efd085cc17060a131225573cae28e40561d5344d8cb498c"}}, "hash": "3ad1934d11f0caa2bf9864c180fdce0c29e0959add4cf7c5b583fd988e9c61ec", "text": "Hyrule is full of emergent opportunities to push your basic understanding of the world and its rules, which only works because of how clever it all is. Weather and elements play a key role, and each act the way that they should, and, as importantly in a video game, Nintendo EPD goes out of its way to explain in multiple instances how that environment works. Many games \u2014 many Zelda games, even \u2014 are plagued by \"video game logic,\" rules that masquerade as common sense but are, more often, the solutions a designer thought a problem should have. But Breath of the Wild teaches you again and again how things work, and the end result was a feeling of achievement in figuring things out that didn\u2019t just seem like guesswork.Breath of the Wild isn\u2019t just difficult for the sake of it, or unnecessarily complicated. All that discovery and progress is deeply, intensely rewarding, and it builds on itself many times over as the world opens up. I struggled to force myself to push toward the game\u2019s conclusion for this review \u2014 a conclusion that could have come much sooner, as players are free to try skipping much of the game\u2019s quest for a straight-shot gambit at Breath of the Wild\u2019s main threat.That sense of consistent achievement and discovery is incredibly important, because it\u2019s the driving force behind Breath of the Wild. Combat is functional, and I rarely died because of systemic inadequacies \u2014 and can I just, for a moment, appreciate playing a console Zelda title whose controls were not designed around motion input?It\u2019s really nice to not have to swing a Wiimote to use Breath of the Wild\u2019s arsenal.Even combat is subject to the same sort of discovery that makes Hyrule such a pleasure to explore, and subject to Breath of the Wild\u2019s experimental proclivities. Weapons are no longer permanent companions. This means you\u2019ll need to learn how to use various options presented to you, and getting attached to any one thing is inviting heartbreak when it literally shatters on the last enemy you\u2019ll ever hit with it. This includes bows, by the way.Other series staples have gained additional utility with their temporary life spans. Example: Boomerangs are now dual-use tools that can be wielded as melee weapons or thrown in traditional Zelda fashion, but if you do the latter, you\u2019ll need to be quick and catch it on the way back.This adds another notable source of excitement to Breath of the Wild, which is important in part because of what the game takes away. While this new take on Hyrule is crawling with dungeons and full of treasure chests, the dungeons lack the same kind of reward loop that proved so deeply satisfying in every other Zelda game. Set-piece dungeons in previous Zelda titles yielded key gear required to advance in the game, providing new abilities and opening up new areas of the map. In Breath of the Wild, those chests have weapons that will eventually break, or Rupees or, perhaps most anticlimactically, crafting materials.I can live with that kind of compromise, even if it was an absence that became more and more apparent over time. Breath of the Wild\u2019s other minor issues are less understandable. While the controls are generally excellent, especially on the Switch\u2019s Pro Controller, the camera can occasionally be a real jerk, particularly while using a bow around trees or fighting multiple enemies in tight quarters. And from a technical perspective, while Breath of the Wild is beautiful, playing the game docked on my TV often resulted in severe frame rate drops. It was never unplayable, but it was distracting.These problems never manifested while playing Breath of the Wild on the Switch undocked as a handheld. While that wasn\u2019t my preferred way to play \u2014 when the Pro Controller is an option, the Joy-Cons\u2019 layouts feel like a punishment by comparison \u2014 there is something impressive about a full console Zelda experience on a handheld.I guess, in the end, it\u2019s not just that Breath of the Wild signals that Zelda has finally evolved and moved beyond the structure it\u2019s leaned on for so long. It\u2019s that the evolution in question has required Nintendo to finally treat its audience like intelligent people. That newfound respect has led to something big, and different, and exciting. But in an open world full of big changes, Breath of the Wild also almost always feels like a Zelda game \u2014 and establishes itself as the first current, vital-feeling Zelda in almost 20 years.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was reviewed using a pre-release physical copy of the game for the Nintendo Switch provided by Nintendo of America.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8567df77-9436-4bc4-a3d6-caf6ac4abfbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "8567df77-9436-4bc4-a3d6-caf6ac4abfbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "01bec167-cc09-477b-bb82-6d7125daa6f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ad1934d11f0caa2bf9864c180fdce0c29e0959add4cf7c5b583fd988e9c61ec"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b1bab03-f34a-4555-a727-c319b69ac182", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f41d20690d0a2edfa939cf1410a525dc5d054f3e161f0881ec9be605a9ca94e"}}, "hash": "e5f04b4b76b0b98e6efd085cc17060a131225573cae28e40561d5344d8cb498c", "text": "You can find additional information about Polygon\u2019s ethics policy here.Please check your email to find a confirmation email, and follow the steps to confirm your humanity.Oops. Something went wrong. Please enter a valid email and try again.\nKotaku, Early in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, I discovered a puzzle shrine containing a small maze. Inside that maze was a little ball. The goal, I realized, was to maneuver the ball out of the maze and slide it into a nearby funnel. To do this, I\u2019d have to rotate my Nintendo Switch controller, using motion controls to turn the maze around and let gravity move the ball through each corridor. One wrong move and the ball would fall out, forcing me to start again.After struggling a few times to solve the puzzle thanks to Newton\u2019s dumb laws, I noticed that every time the ball fell, a new one would drop from a canister several feet above the maze. Then I had a wild thought. Just before a new ball dropped, I turned my controller upside down, flipping the maze 180 degrees. There was nothing on the other side, so I now had a nice flat surface on which to roll the ball. I slowly tilted the maze\u2019s newly exposed backside and dropped the ball right into the funnel, skipping the maze entirely. Boom. Puzzle solved.For decades now, Zelda games have been about what you can\u2019t do as much as they are about what you can. You can\u2019t pick up that rock until you find the Power Gloves. You can\u2019t go swimming until you buy Zora\u2019s Flippers. See that big gap? You can\u2019t cross it until you get the Hookshot. Since Link to the Past, just about every Zelda game has followed this same rhythm: You start off in a narrow world that gradually expands as you make progress. You see a wall with cracks in it and make a mental note to come back once you snag some bombs. Your curiosity is piqued by what you can\u2019t yet access, and every new dungeon brings with it a rush of dopamine as you wait to see what helpful new gadget you\u2019ll find there and what kind of secrets it will let you discover.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, in contrast, is all about what you can do. This is a game that says \u201cyes\u201d to anything you ask of it. From the very beginning, you can swim in any lake, pick up any boulder, and cross any pit. When you try some crazy experiment, the game will oblige. You can climb up any wall, mountain, or tower in the world, which allows you the freedom to explore the map in a way that no Zelda game has matched. Breath of the Wild never asks you to wait for a new item before you uncover its secrets. It just keeps saying yes.In 1986, The Legend of Zelda conjured the illusion that you could explore a boundless world. Its single-screen areas were metaphors. Like the town icons on the world map of a JRPG, The Legend of Zelda\u2019s pixely mountains and forests were meant to represent a grander topography. Our imagination did most of the work. Today the first Zelda may look dusty and primitive, but it\u2019s not hard to see why it had such an impact. It felt infinite.In 2017, we don\u2019t need our imagination anymore. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild doesn\u2019t just evoke the feelings of a boundless world; it gives you one. The game feels, in so many ways, like what Zelda has always strived to be. Free of the traditions that the series has followed so rigorously over the past decade, Breath of the Wild emerges triumphant. It is groundbreaking. It is the pinnacle of Zelda.Zelda games typically follow a common progression: You, as the pointy-eared adventurer Link, start off asleep in a bed. You are woken up, told you are a hero, and sent off to go find a sword somewhere. After some tutorial sections, you\u2019ll learn that there are X MacGuffins out in the world that you\u2019ll have to go save/recover/find. Each one of these MacGuffins is linked to a dungeon, and each dungeon contains a different key item. Already you know what some of those items will be: bombs, a boomerang, a hookshot. There\u2019s always some sort of gimmick, like a mirror that transports you between worlds or a musical instrument that can control time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b1bab03-f34a-4555-a727-c319b69ac182": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b1bab03-f34a-4555-a727-c319b69ac182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "8567df77-9436-4bc4-a3d6-caf6ac4abfbd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e5f04b4b76b0b98e6efd085cc17060a131225573cae28e40561d5344d8cb498c"}, "3": {"node_id": "6bb66638-870c-4def-b43d-7dc3aa844387", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "56f08fdc2587197f0c2371ce35caf6b63e3caa9f3c19bbd79305b0b28f677adb"}}, "hash": "2f41d20690d0a2edfa939cf1410a525dc5d054f3e161f0881ec9be605a9ca94e", "text": "Interspersed between each dungeon are various quests and secrets, and once you\u2019ve acquired all of the MacGuffins, you\u2019ll fight Ganon. End of game.When you first start off Breath of the Wild, it seems to follow that same pattern. You are woken up from a cryogenic sleep chamber inside of a small cave. You are told that you are a hero. You pick up a multi-purpose tool called a Sheikah Slate\u2014your gimmick item\u2014and grab a shirt and pants from nearby chests. Then you make your way toward the exit and find something unusual: a wall, blocking your progress. There are no buttons or switches, no cracks for a bomb or pegs for a hookshot. Instead, you learn, you are meant to jump onto the wall and climb it. This revelation may inspire in Zelda devotees a series of exciting thoughts. Is this a new ability? Is it just situational? If you can climb this wall, what else can you climb? Once you leave the cave and squint your way into the sunlight, you might experiment with this newfound ability and discover the answer: You can climb everything. Link can scale almost any surface in the game, from cave walls to cliff-sides, which is a thrilling way to traverse the world. Think about it like this: As you are exploring Breath of the Wild\u2019s massive version of Hyrule, you\u2019ll never have to stop because there\u2019s something in your way.Once you\u2019ve escaped the cave, you\u2019ll probably be bracing yourself for Breath of the Wild\u2019s inevitable tutorial section. (You might think: If it\u2019s anything like the last console Zelda game, Skyward Sword, it\u2019ll be an hour or two before the real game starts.) Then, as you walk down the rocky path outside, it\u2019ll dawn on you: There is no tutorial section. The real game has already started. You can go talk to that important-looking bearded man a few feet away or you can just start walking in a random direction, climbing over any obstacle you find. You don\u2019t have to go find your sword. You can just pick up a nearby stick, or steal the old man\u2019s axe, or defeat a monster and take its weapon. A blue spirit won\u2019t pop out and tell you that no, you shouldn\u2019t go that way until you talk to the old man. Breath of the Wild always says yes. Fi and Navi and Midna aren\u2019t welcome here.Consider the Zelda pattern broken. The first time you find a boomerang won\u2019t be prefaced by Link peeking into a glowing chest as music swells. You\u2019ll just kill a monster and take its boomerang. Breath of the Wild does have MacGuffins, as you\u2019ll eventually learn, but instead of getting them in linear progression, you can go hunt them down in any order. Or you can ignore them entirely and just go fight Ganon with three hearts and no clothing (which will no doubt lead to some incredible speedruns over the next few months). When you emerge from that opening cave, you\u2019ll find yourself on a vista, peeking out at the beautiful mountains and ruins of Hyrule as the \u201cBreath of the Wild\u201d title appears on screen. In another Zelda game, those mountains and ruins would be part of the scenery. If you could go there at all, you\u2019d be confined to a specific area. In Breath of the Wild, you can walk across every inch.I recommend playing Breath of the Wild with a notebook, not because you\u2019ll need it to solve puzzles (the way you would in, say, The Witness, a game that resembles this one in some unexpected and striking ways) but because you\u2019ll want to keep a to-do list. It\u2019s easy to get distracted, to be walking toward one goal only to see something enticing in the distance. It\u2019s helpful to remember that you really want to go check out that strange-looking ring of rocks once you\u2019re done exploring the ruins (but also, you really should go finish that one sidequest).A slice of gameplay might look something like this: You walk into a new region. It\u2019s themed in some way, maybe based on a desert or a tropical jungle. You see a big, glowing tower\u2014one of the structures in each region that you scale in order to fill out more of your map, Ubisoft-style. You tag it with your binoculars, then head in that direction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bb66638-870c-4def-b43d-7dc3aa844387": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bb66638-870c-4def-b43d-7dc3aa844387", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b1bab03-f34a-4555-a727-c319b69ac182", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f41d20690d0a2edfa939cf1410a525dc5d054f3e161f0881ec9be605a9ca94e"}, "3": {"node_id": "b705c290-c025-463a-a76f-3844b6f40672", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2859e888286be29dae2b0aba964f1204dba24509bcce0db4461c9e6d2ec007d4"}}, "hash": "56f08fdc2587197f0c2371ce35caf6b63e3caa9f3c19bbd79305b0b28f677adb", "text": "You tag it with your binoculars, then head in that direction. On your way, you collect some herbs (which you\u2019ll cook next time you find a fire) and kill a couple of Chu-Chus, grabbing the jelly they leave behind (useful for elixirs). Then you see something interesting. A pillar of smoke above palm trees in the distance, maybe, or a giant tree stump surrounded by enemy lizards. So you take a detour, climbing and slashing your way to a new goal. Maybe you find a cool new weapon, like a sword that lights on fire when you swing it. Maybe you just find some rocks. Maybe you stumble upon a village\u2014one of the many, many villages, full of people and shops and quests\u2014or a giant boss who comes out of nowhere and tears you in half. (You will die a lot in Breath of the Wild. Good news: the auto-save system is forgiving.)There are a few things to keep in mind as you go. Climbing walls and mountains will gradually drain your stamina, an upgradable energy meter that you\u2019ll also use while running and using Link\u2019s portable hang glider. If you run out of stamina in the middle of a climb, Link will plummet, potentially to his death. You\u2019ll have to be a little careful, sizing up mountains and walls to make sure you can actually climb them before you start scaling. But the rules are flexible. Your movement is based on physics rather than a \u201cnavmesh\u201d\u2014which, in English, means that Link can walk on anything in the world\u2014so there are ways to manipulate the way Link moves. If you see little ridges on a mountain, you can often get Link to stop climbing and just stand on them for a few seconds, recovering his stamina so you can climb further.Is this sort of extended climbing an unintentional effect of the game\u2019s code? A devious way to make the player feel smart? Or the net result of a video game that\u2019s designed around saying \u201cyes\u201d to everything?Breath of the Wild\u2019s entire world is based around that philosophy, which may sometimes make you feel like you\u2019re cheating. You can use ice arrows to freeze a monster, then shatter him with a sledgehammer, killing him instantly. You can light a fire with some wood and flint, then use the drafts created by that fire to propel yourself in the air so you can then glide to an unexplored area. You can play around with gravity, inertia, and all of the other physics rules that Nintendo stuck in this game, using them to manipulate and break the world. There are times when you may feel like you\u2019re accessing places that you\u2019re not supposed to reach yet, but Breath of the Wild would disagree with that perspective. Breath of the Wild wants you to go wherever you want.Breath of the Wild also wants you to feel like exploring is a worthwhile use of your time, which it accomplishes in several ways. First, by letting Link choose from a wide variety of weapons and gear. Second, by sprinkling puzzles and shrines throughout the world. (Shrines serve as both fast travel points and mini-dungeons. There are around 100 in the game, and for every four you complete, you can upgrade your health or stamina.) And third, by making every item useful. There are hundreds of objects all across the world that you can harvest and collect, from apples to snails to precious minerals. Find a fire and you can combine these objects, cooking them to make valuable food and potions. The better your stock of food and potions, the better your chances of surviving a tough encounter. Survive the tough encounter and you\u2019ll find more puzzles, shrines, and gear. And so on.This may make you wonder just what kind of game Breath of the Wild is. It\u2019s a Zelda where you switch weapons and chop down trees? What? It\u2019s safe to say that you\u2019ve never played anything like it before. Because even as Breath of the Wild takes liberally from other games (a long list that includes Far Cry, Skyrim, and even Portal) it never stops feeling like Zelda. That isn\u2019t just because you wear a tunic and solve problems for rock-eating Gorons; it\u2019s because Breath of the Wild feels polished and carefully crafted in the way that Nintendo has mastered over the past few decades. The new Hyrule feels huge, but never empty. It feels vast, but never random. There are puzzle clues and design tricks all throughout the world, which is dense and full of secrets.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b705c290-c025-463a-a76f-3844b6f40672": {"__data__": {"id_": "b705c290-c025-463a-a76f-3844b6f40672", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "6bb66638-870c-4def-b43d-7dc3aa844387", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "56f08fdc2587197f0c2371ce35caf6b63e3caa9f3c19bbd79305b0b28f677adb"}, "3": {"node_id": "dde3370b-1a7f-44f1-a721-2f514d2a39a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd6affbd9a3d93ac13924df5f82162d36a9535c23c69510538ec8af23d492f57"}}, "hash": "2859e888286be29dae2b0aba964f1204dba24509bcce0db4461c9e6d2ec007d4", "text": "Even the placement of rocks feels deliberate.At E3 2014, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma told me that with his next big game, he wanted to reinvent the notion of a Zelda puzzle. \u201cI think people have come to just assume that puzzle-solving will exist in a Zelda game,\u201d he said, \u201cand I kinda wanna change that, maybe turn it on its ear. As a player progresses through any game, they\u2019re making choices. They\u2019re making hopefully logical choices to progress them in the game. And when I hear \u2018puzzle solving,\u2019 I think of like moving blocks so that a door opens or something like that. But I feel like making those logical choices and taking information that you received previously and making decisions based on that can also be a sort of puzzle-solving. So I want to kinda rethink or maybe reconstruct the idea of puzzle-solving within the Zelda universe.\u201dFor those of us who rank Link to the Past and Wind Waker among the greatest games of all time, this was more than a little alarming. A Zelda without traditional puzzles? The main reason to play Zelda was the excitement of finding a new dungeon, picking it apart, and solving a series of progressively difficult puzzles with whatever object you\u2019d find there. Wasn\u2019t it? Breath of the Wild answers that question with a resounding \u201cnope.\u201d You won\u2019t push blocks on buttons in the newest Zelda (although you might move them around with magnets), and there are no specific dungeon items that will let you forge new paths. Yet the game never feels short on puzzles. It is, as Aonuma promised, a reconstruction of \u201cpuzzle-solving\u201d in a Zelda game.Instead of stuffing all of its puzzles into dungeons, the new Zelda sprinkles them everywhere. Here are several examples of the types of puzzles you\u2019ll find in Breath of the Wild:Some of these puzzles have multiple solutions, and some of them can be quite difficult. Occasionally you\u2019ll want to manipulate the physics system to solve a puzzle, as I did when I flipped around that maze, and sometimes the best option is simply the most logical one (put the ball in the well). Other times, the best option is to leave a puzzle shrine and go find something else to do for a little while.Because you can explore Breath of the Wild\u2019s enormous world in any sequence that you\u2019d like, and because there are no gates blocking your progress anywhere, there is no way for the game to offer any sort of escalating puzzle progression. Which makes for a dilemma. If you\u2019re not getting new items or abilities all the time, how can this Zelda introduce new types of puzzles? How can it ramp up the difficulty in a way that feels natural?Of course, this isn\u2019t the first time Zelda has tried to go non-linear. With Link Between Worlds (2013), Eiji Aonuma and crew had already played around with the standard progression formula. Rather than acquire a new item in each dungeon, you\u2019d buy or rent everything from an item store in the center of the map. Each dungeon required one specific item, and you could do them in any order, with the assurance that, for example, the bomb dungeon wouldn\u2019t have any puzzles that required the fire rod. While this led to an excellent Zelda game\u2014and Link Between Worlds had some stellar dungeons\u2014it also made the puzzles a little too easy. You immediately knew that every puzzle in the bomb dungeon required bombs, so the solutions became apparent fast.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild takes another stab at this problem. You start off the game on an area called the Great Plateau, where you\u2019ll be stuck until you get a paraglider that lets you float down to the world below. Before you get this paraglider, you have to finish four puzzle shrines that will get you four key abilities, allowing you to: throw bombs, use a magnet to move metal objects, freeze time for an object and conjure frozen ice columns from water. Until you have these abilities, you can\u2019t get off the plateau.This is technically the only time the game says \u201cno,\u201d because you can\u2019t leave until you get the tools. But those very tools are the things that allow the designers to present constantly varied puzzles, safe in the knowledge that you have a variety of possible solutions. It\u2019s a brilliant bit of subterfuge. Now, you can go anywhere, and the game can come up with all sorts of tricks to throw your way, knowing that you\u2019ll have access to all four of these abilities no matter what.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dde3370b-1a7f-44f1-a721-2f514d2a39a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "dde3370b-1a7f-44f1-a721-2f514d2a39a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "b705c290-c025-463a-a76f-3844b6f40672", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2859e888286be29dae2b0aba964f1204dba24509bcce0db4461c9e6d2ec007d4"}, "3": {"node_id": "f1fc6e2e-f3dc-457d-aac4-1526ddd01e25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d434b2aceffda7dbd66dc064fe116e55f085819532794652ce1c8dc104b1dc2"}}, "hash": "cd6affbd9a3d93ac13924df5f82162d36a9535c23c69510538ec8af23d492f57", "text": "You won\u2019t get new items that\u2019ll help you solve puzzles the way you would in previous Zelda games, but dozens of hours into Breath of the Wild, you\u2019ll still encounter new combinations that will stump you.

Instead of introducing a series of stand-alone puzzle rooms, each of these dungeons serves as one big puzzle with its own rules and ideas. Breath of the Wild won\u2019t offer that traditional Zelda feeling that you\u2019re powering through dungeons that escalate in scale and complexity as you go, which may make some fans wistful, but this new Zelda has dungeons that feel plenty complex on their own. No hookshots or spinners necessary.And, not to worry, there are no block puzzles. Though you may get sick of moving orbs around.Here is a complaint about The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The \u201csprint\u201d button is mapped by default to X. You can swap it to B, but either way this poses a problem: To run and move the camera at the same time, you need to put your right hand into \u201cclaw\u201d position, which is neither comfortable nor sustainable. The L3 button, which should let you sprint, is in fact the crouch button. There is no way to remap it. For a game that so often says yes, Breath of the Wild\u2019s insistence on saying \u201cno\u201d here is baffling.It\u2019s tough to review a game like Breath of the Wild without giving away too many of its secrets. Should I tell you about what I found on that tiny island in the middle of a sea of lava? Should I talk about what I discovered when I tried to climb a certain landmark that you wouldn\u2019t think was climbable? Should I recount the story of the time I chugged a fireproof elixir and ran through Death Mountain, making it to Goron City just as the elixir wore off and my hearts started to drain? I won\u2019t tell you more about the dungeons. They\u2019re too cool to spoil.I won\u2019t tell you about the dramatic, optional set-piece that my colleague Kirk excitedly urged me to go check out. He wouldn\u2019t want me to spoil it. I definitely won\u2019t tell you about what happened in that one island in the corner of the map, because it made me sit up in our San Francisco hotel room (where we\u2019re here for the Game Developers Conference) and say \u201choly shit, Kirk, you have to go to the island.\u201d (He hasn\u2019t. He hasn\u2019t played Suikoden II yet, either.)This is a game that will dominate dinner conversations. It\u2019s a game that will lead to countless anecdotes, discoveries, and swapped stories. Already, colleagues and I have spent a great deal of time comparing notes and talking about how we solved major puzzles. For one early section in which you have to figure out how to get Link through a freezing cold mountain, three Kotaku writers found three completely different ways to proceed. We\u2019ve discussed surprise boss encounters, hidden puzzles, and where to find all the Korok seeds that are sprinkled across Hyrule. We\u2019ve talked about Breath of the Wild\u2019s mysteries and weird secrets, telling tales about the time one of us jumped down to a crevasse that seemed unexplorable, but in fact contained a new shrine: the designers\u2019 way of rewarding curious players.And as you talk about Breath of the Wild with your friends, there\u2019s one word that will rarely if ever come up: \u201ccan\u2019t.\u201d Stories about the new Zelda will instead revolve around what you can do. How you climbed all the way to the top of the Temple of Time just for kicks, or how you parachuted down to the lowest point of Hyrule to see what kind of secrets you\u2019d find there. How you found a brilliant method to brute-force your way through the freezing, snowy mountains, or how you set a forest on fire just to see if you could.Or, how you tried something as ridiculous as flipping over a maze so you wouldn\u2019t have to solve it, and the game somehow let you finish the puzzle anyway. Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game to date, and it accomplishes that simply by saying yes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1fc6e2e-f3dc-457d-aac4-1526ddd01e25": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1fc6e2e-f3dc-457d-aac4-1526ddd01e25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "dde3370b-1a7f-44f1-a721-2f514d2a39a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd6affbd9a3d93ac13924df5f82162d36a9535c23c69510538ec8af23d492f57"}, "3": {"node_id": "d42c9c06-c4e5-471d-a778-0b44264d7d70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e29ce54c6f380bb39ca9a1d60779f106c8d0577161cc8e859770126f03e2c6e"}}, "hash": "8d434b2aceffda7dbd66dc064fe116e55f085819532794652ce1c8dc104b1dc2", "text": "Giant Bomb, Ghost Busters: Spirits Unleashed ECTO EditionUnprofessional FridaysGame Mess Mornings 10/27/23GrubbSnaxMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Spoilercast with Bryan IntiharGameSpot After DarkDiscord Town Hall 10/27/23Giant Bomb PresentsThe Community Spotlight 2023.10.28The Community Spotlight 2023.10.21The Community Spotlight 2023.10.14The Community Spotlight 2023.10.28The Community Spotlight 2023.10.21The Community Spotlight 2023.10.14Posted by\n                                                                        Vinny Caravella\n                                                                         |\n                      Mar. 2, 2017 3:00am                     Dan takes a really deep breath of that wild as we go off on a grand adventure... and boy, there seems to be a lot of wild here.You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.\n        Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?\n      Sign up or Sign in now!\n      \n        By clicking 'enter', you agree to Giant Bomb's\n                        Terms of Use and\n        Privacy PolicyenterLink's most ambitious adventure is one of Nintendo's crowning achievements.Nintendo has never introduced a true disaster to their core Legend of Zelda series, but most of the last ten years has felt lacking in inspiration. Games like Skyward Sword and Spirit Tracks were perfectly solid on their own merits, yet they paled in comparison to the more impactful entries from the series\u2019 past. Attempts at freshening up the franchise usually came in the form of touch- or motion-based experiments, while the format of the games still riffed on established concepts dating as far back as the Super Nintendo. One major exception was 2013\u2019s A Link Between Worlds (which was based on that same Super Nintendo game, ironically). With that 3DS installment, Nintendo finally made some bold changes to the series\u2019 aging format. Tweaking the item system and allowing players to choose dungeon order proved to be a shot in the arm for a franchise that had long rested on its tried-and-true trademarks.If A Link Between Worlds was the game that dared to change things up, Breath of the Wild is the game that blows everything wide open. It deems no rule sacred, removing or changing numerous systems we\u2019ve come to expect from the franchise. The end result is a total reinvention of Zelda that manages to evoke the exact same feelings that made it iconic to begin with.One of the most welcome changes is almost immediately apparent. While the past two console entries (Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess) had painfully long introductory sequences, this swings hard in the other direction. Link wakes up, briefly talks to a mysterious old man, and is exploring an open world and solving puzzles within minutes. It\u2019s essentially the difference between \u201ctalk to everyone on this sky island for six hours\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to go alone! Take this.\u201dYour first order of business is to visit four mini-dungeons so that you can acquire four runes. These runes grant you the ability to create remote bombs, manipulate magnetic objects, stop time, and create pillars of ice in pools of water. Once you\u2019ve proven that you know how to wield these powers, you\u2019re given a paraglider that allows you to leave the opening plateau and experience the rest of Hyrule.I was initially skeptical of this approach. In the past, a big part of the Zelda experience was obtaining new items within its dungeons. I was worried that by giving me powers upfront instead of doling them out in dungeons, the game would be taking away the joy of obtaining a new tool.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d42c9c06-c4e5-471d-a778-0b44264d7d70": {"__data__": {"id_": "d42c9c06-c4e5-471d-a778-0b44264d7d70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "f1fc6e2e-f3dc-457d-aac4-1526ddd01e25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d434b2aceffda7dbd66dc064fe116e55f085819532794652ce1c8dc104b1dc2"}, "3": {"node_id": "aed336e8-beb8-4980-ad4c-6b5be5ca3097", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0dd03cc2089f31107ea520efb31ce6ce889a8ffd480073b01c27970e5ad2622e"}}, "hash": "9e29ce54c6f380bb39ca9a1d60779f106c8d0577161cc8e859770126f03e2c6e", "text": "In earlier games, you\u2019d get something like the hookshot and realize that you could now cross that broken bridge or get on top of that plateau. Breath of the Wild replaces that joy with a much more substantial sense of freedom and possibility. You\u2019re not waiting for an item in a treasure chest to let you get across that bridge or onto that plateau. You already have all the tools you need, it\u2019s just a matter of making it happen.With just these four abilities, you\u2019re able to solve any of the game\u2019s 100-plus shrines. You\u2019re also able to explore almost all of the massive Hyrule map using just your paraglider and climbing ability. By giving you all of this upfront, Breath of the Wild is essentially saying \u201cHere you go, have fun\u201d and setting you loose. Upgrades to your stamina and gear certainly make climbing and traversal quicker and easier, but I was able to get just about anywhere I wanted with enough patience and planning.Plenty of open world games allow you to explore the entire map at your leisure, but Hyrule\u2019s landscape and Link\u2019s ability to climb makes for more rewarding exploration than I\u2019ve ever seen in the genre. Most of the world isn\u2019t accessible by easy-to-follow roads and waypoints. I spent many hours exploring off the beaten path, gliding across canyons, and scaling mountains. Some of these peaks seem insurmountable at first, but the summit can usually be reached if you\u2019re smart about looking for places to rest and get a quick stamina recharge. When things go wrong, it often ends with Link ragdolling down the side of a rocky cliff. When they go right, there\u2019s frequently a secret, a new vantage point for spotting shrines, or at least a beautiful view awaiting you.One thing you'll be climbing an awful lot of is towers. Each area of the map features one orange tower, and scaling it will turn it blue and fill in details for the region on your map. Unlike many open world games, filling it in doesn't mean it gives you the location of shrines, towns, and other points of interest. It simply gives you the outlines of major landmasses and bodies of water. Even small details like a hot spring won't be labelled until you're basically dipping Link's toes in it. Whenever you spot something that you think you might want to return to, it's easy to mark it on the map with a variety of icons. I found this to be extremely helpful for marking shrines that I spotted in the distance, areas that required arrows when I had none, mineral-rich mountainsides, and mysterious creatures and pieces of the environment that I wanted to investigate later. It doesn\u2019t feel like the map is huge for the sake of being huge. While there are stretches of unpopulated land, I never felt like I was at a loss for things to do. There are plenty of shrines to locate, wildlife to photograph and hunt, minerals and food to collect, friendly characters to help, and camps of enemies to battle and loot. One of my favorite things that happened frequently was finding myself out of my league. Since I spent so many of my early hours exploring the world, I\u2019d inevitably wander into areas that I was not properly equipped for. Rather than running from these higher-level enemies, I saw them as a challenge. With no items being gated behind dungeons, I knew that the tools to beat these enemies were already at my disposal, even if any one of their attacks could wipe me out instantaneously. Taking out a Lynel late in the game feels like an accomplishment. Slaying one when I only had five heart containers felt like a triumph.Your challenges won\u2019t always come in the form of high-level enemies. My adventures off the beaten path sometimes came to an end when I found myself in the freezing cold without proper gear. Link would shiver and take damage until I had to teleport to safer ground and rethink my approach. Before you find new gear that helps you combat weather, you can fight the elements by cooking. It\u2019s an imprecise and somewhat silly system, but it\u2019s fun to experiment and toss a bunch of ingredients into a pot and hope for the best. You begin to learn the general formula for success after you screw up and create barely edible meals on enough occasions. If I knew I was heading into a cold region of the map, I\u2019d gain some heat resistance by mixing spicy peppers into various meat and fruit dishes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aed336e8-beb8-4980-ad4c-6b5be5ca3097": {"__data__": {"id_": "aed336e8-beb8-4980-ad4c-6b5be5ca3097", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "d42c9c06-c4e5-471d-a778-0b44264d7d70", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e29ce54c6f380bb39ca9a1d60779f106c8d0577161cc8e859770126f03e2c6e"}, "3": {"node_id": "50df1091-dc90-442b-a718-ca36e34221d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e871231d2ba9d2d3149ee03bce2506b73254d6d107e6fc166a4d9e4d6b9fb44a"}}, "hash": "0dd03cc2089f31107ea520efb31ce6ce889a8ffd480073b01c27970e5ad2622e", "text": "If I was about to take on a difficult enemy, I\u2019d make a few meals that utilized defense-boosting mushrooms and heart-restoring radishes.I\u2019m glad that the cooking system isn\u2019t overly cumbersome, as it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Among the sweeping changes to series tradition is the method in which you heal yourself. In almost every past entry, you could recover from a damaging battle by simply cutting some grass or breaking some pots until you found enough hearts. That option is nowhere to be found here. You can eat raw food off of the ground if you\u2019d like, but you need to cook meals if you hope to have any serious source of health recovery.Not finding hearts in the wild is one of many seemingly minor changes that add up to make the game feel so much different than its predecessors. Rupees are rarely found in the field, as most are earned by selling materials and completing sidequests. Twilight Princess surprised me by requiring five heart pieces to make a container instead of four, but Breath of the Wild goes several steps further and omits them altogether (new hearts are earned by trading in orbs earned in shrines). You\u2019ll be snatching fairies out of the air with your hand, as bottles are gone. Boomerangs will fly right back over your head if you don\u2019t press A to catch them. Cutscenes feature voice acting. There\u2019s a jump button.Among the bigger changes is the optional nature and the structure of Breath of the Wild\u2019s traditional dungeons. Like they\u2019ve usually been, these are longer, puzzle-driven affairs that end in boss fights. That\u2019s where the similarities end, however. The \u201cget the map, the compass, the big key, and the dungeon item\u201d format is completely gone. Those last three things are completely absent, and you\u2019re given a map at the very beginning of each dungeon. How you interact with the dungeons themselves is a puzzle element unique to these areas, and I don\u2019t want to spoil the specifics here.These dungeons\u2014like just about everything in the game\u2014are completely optional. That said, they\u2019re a lot of fun and will certainly make your final quest an easier ordeal. Perhaps more important than the traditional dungeons are the tiny shrines that are scattered across the map. These act as fast travel points, and you\u2019ll be able to upgrade your heart or stamina capacity each time you complete four of them. Most of these are filled with traditional Zelda puzzles. You\u2019ll utilize your runes and wits to place boxes onto switches, complete electrical circuits, manipulate balancing tools, and plenty more. On occasion, they\u2019ll present you with tests of combat prowess or goofy motion-based mini-golf puzzles. If the process of getting to the shrine was particularly tough, sometimes it\u2019ll simply present you with a treasure chest and send you on your way.On the Switch, these shrines have the added benefit of being fantastic for portable play. This game can be a massive undertaking that benefits from long marathon sessions. On the other hand, these bite-sized shrines usually don\u2019t take much time at all. If I\u2019m on a bus and only have 20 minutes to play, I might not want to go on a lengthy quest into the wilderness. Knocking out a few shrines and upgrading my stamina is a perfectly reasonable task, however.Most shrines feature hidden treasure chests. Frequently, these contain equipment like melee weapons, bows, or shields. I lost track of how many times I\u2019d get to one, only to be told that my inventory was full. When this happened, I\u2019d step away from the chest, cycle through what I was holding, and toss several items at my feet before grabbing my new toy. It\u2019s frustrating at times, but you thankfully can upgrade your storage capacity by collecting hidden seeds and delivering them to a specific character.Another frustration comes about thanks to the weapons themselves. Almost all of them will break eventually, which can be annoying when you\u2019re trying to decide what to bring into each battle. Do you want to use your awesome lightning sword on that group of basic Bokoblins, or do you want to dispatch them with your super-slow two-handed rusty broadsword? Some may enjoy the decision-making that this forces you to do, but I usually wished I could just go in swinging with my favorite weapon without worrying about it shattering. It can be a frustrating system at times, but it\u2019s remedied somewhat by the steady availability of new weapons in the field.Breath of the Wild also has issues on the technical end.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50df1091-dc90-442b-a718-ca36e34221d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "50df1091-dc90-442b-a718-ca36e34221d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "aed336e8-beb8-4980-ad4c-6b5be5ca3097", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0dd03cc2089f31107ea520efb31ce6ce889a8ffd480073b01c27970e5ad2622e"}, "3": {"node_id": "2fba30f6-dab2-4f67-8a81-a88539029d08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "adbf97006c20f5e8a49e05496f505615c785afeeb8fce1e3277399e4990d41ae"}}, "hash": "e871231d2ba9d2d3149ee03bce2506b73254d6d107e6fc166a4d9e4d6b9fb44a", "text": "Its art style and character design are among the best I\u2019ve seen in the series, but there\u2019s no denying that the framerate takes a big hit from time to time. This is most evident in areas like dense forests and populated towns. Things usually move along at a decent clip, but you\u2019re bound to notice the game chugging if you take a stroll through Kakariko Village during a rainstorm. That said, I never felt like it interfered with combat or platforming scenarios at any point.This can be either the shortest or\u2014more likely\u2014the longest Zelda game depending on how you play it. You can go for a novelty speed run and charge Ganon right out of the gate. You can put a couple of dozen hours into the adventure, beat two or three dungeons, and decide you\u2019re ready to take on the endgame. Or you could do what I did, which is spend almost 100 hours exploring the map and enhancing Link\u2019s gear, health, and stamina before you\u2019re ready to see the credits.You decide when it\u2019s time to end the game. It\u2019s a great feeling, and I loved having such a defined goal throughout (\u201cDefeat Ganon\u201d is the first quest given to you). I wanted to be as powerful as possible in preparation for the climactic battle. When the time came, I felt like I was in an action movie \u201cgearing-up\u201d montage as I purchased bundles of every type of arrow, optimized my weapon inventory, put on my highest-rated gear, and cooked plenty of hearty meals. With at least 30 well-salted meat dinners lining the pockets of my fanciest armor, I breached the perimeter of Hyrule Castle and prepared to take on Ganon.There\u2019s great joy to be found in the big moments like this as well as the myriad little details. I laughed when lightning struck me for the first time, instantly killing Link. I asked the goofy scientist guy in Akkala to introduce himself every time I saw him, because I couldn\u2019t get enough of the little dance and sound effect that accompanied it. I was fascinated with what I found on Eventide Island, and spent over an hour making sure that I performed its unique task perfectly.Every night, I sat on the couch and played until I genuinely couldn\u2019t stay awake any longer. Every morning, I couldn\u2019t get out of bed and turn on the Switch fast enough. Near the end, I found myself getting sad as I climbed the final towers and saw the map fill in. This Hyrule gave me such a profound sense of discovery, and I never wanted the mysteries to end. Even now, I have no idea of the purpose of numerous things that I saw. Ganon may be dead and I watched the credits roll, but I want to keep jumping back in until I\u2019ve seen everything there is to see.This sense of wonder is something that I haven\u2019t felt so strongly since I played A Link to the Past when I was seven years old. Ocarina of Time was able to capture some of that same magic in my teenage years. Now that I\u2019m in my thirties, I don\u2019t think that I expected it to be possible for a game to make me feel like that again. I\u2019ve been reviewing video games for twelve years now, and I\u2019m used to describing games in a certain way. \u201cThis game controls well. This mechanic is innovative. The graphics are stunning. The skill tree feels limited.\u201d That type of language doesn\u2019t adequately convey how Breath of the Wild made me feel. Nintendo may have changed so many long-standing traditions of the Zelda franchise, but the spirit of discovery is as strong as it\u2019s ever been no matter your age. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d feel the Zelda magic this strongly ever again, but I couldn't be happier to be proven wrong.\u00a9 2023 FANDOM, INC.

Even I'm guilty of it from time to time. Breath of the Wild actually earns that cliche, however. The heart of this game is the original 31 year old Legend of Zelda, with its open-ended go anywhere and do anything mentality and its unforgiving difficulty. Breath of the Wild pushes aside much of the streamlining that's crept into the series over the years, doing away with a bunch of tradition alongside it. It's a scary prospect, but also absolutely works out for the best. If Nintendo wanted to and if the Zelda lore were more connected, they could've easily branded this a reboot.Breath of the Wild is an example of Nintendo at its most self-aware. This incidentally is also when the company is often at its best. It borrows not only from its own history but from currently popular peers. Tower climbing is an obvious addition to an open world Zelda, but somehow it has a Nintendo touch where it doesn't fill in location names or icons, leading you to look out from atop the tower with binoculars to tag interesting structures or destinations in the far distance. RPG-style armour and loot systems are new for Zelda too, much of this designed to offset the now far more difficult combat. The whimsical exploration of an open Hyrule with a broad range of terrain feels very aware of Skyrim, while weapon and item durability and collecting ingredients, creatures and other tools for cooking feels like Nintendo took a good long look at the massive growth of the survival genre. This Zelda has a little bit from all these influences and more besides. \n \nSome have worried that this means the core of Zelda - puzzle-solving dungeons - will be diluted. It's true that Breath of the Wild doesn't have the typical Zelda outlay of eight-plus dungeons to tackle, but what you get instead is a far more accomplished world. Spread out all over the place are shrines. There are over 100 of these, and for every 4 completed you can upgrade your health or stamina. A handful focus on combat but the vast majority of them are focused entirely on puzzles. Rather than the puzzle content being concentrated into a few large levels it's been spread out across the game world into these one or two-room mini dungeons. There's just as much dungeon action as any Zelda, but by spreading this content out you're encouraged to get out in the world to explore. For some shrines the puzzle is in finding it in the first place, many featuring some genius environmental puzzle solving out in the overworld.Even the more traditional dungeons that remain have a significantly different angle. Each of the four is a giant mechanical animal, and each beast's innards are more open than previous Zelda dungeons. Not one has a small key or boss key to worry about, but rather a series of locations you need to reach and switches you need to flick. The gimmick for each is different: each robotic animal is stomping, swimming or flying around the open world, and you can move their body parts to reorient pieces of the dungeon or otherwise significantly change the dungeon's layout. This makes for some cool puzzle-solving moments, like tilting the wings and opening windows of the bird beast in order to let gusts of wind from outside assist you.\"The moment when you don't have another thing on your personal check-list of things to do in Breath of the Wild is rare, because there's always something new on the horizon you can tackle.\"These four dungeons are optional parts of the main quest - but then again, almost everything is optional. If you want to run straight from the starting point to Hyrule Castle you can - you just won't survive. The speed run community for this game is likely going to be fascinating. Even the Master Sword, so prominent in trailers, is an optional pick-up that actually requires quite a bit of investment to get - but that makes getting it all the more special.Instead of focus on a main story progression, Nintendo wants you to explore. Everything is informed by this desire. Weapon durability exists to make you consider every encounter carefully: despite hating weapon durability in many games, here it always gave me pause: do I want to use my good sword on this goblin camp? Or should I play smarter to take them out one-by-one with weaker weapons? Panic and dilemma early on about which weapons to keep and which to throw away every time I found a new one drove me to explore for Korok Seeds, the collectable that allows you to upgrade your inventory space. Durability also means you're constantly on the hunt for a better weapon, and chests are hidden absolutely everywhere.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29d003cb-3dde-4d64-89ee-01216ee87415": {"__data__": {"id_": "29d003cb-3dde-4d64-89ee-01216ee87415", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "2fba30f6-dab2-4f67-8a81-a88539029d08", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "adbf97006c20f5e8a49e05496f505615c785afeeb8fce1e3277399e4990d41ae"}, "3": {"node_id": "86d222cf-d259-465d-9538-c510125f5c35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "445a58402d9784ba0ed969f3fd2a325ed79e6008da0e3f53d4081e45592eb703"}}, "hash": "bf6e57718c57af3d1ce3c9988d26e61b215fdb3e81c5bbccb90e813fe16fa10e", "text": "Combat is difficult, but also challenging is Hyrule itself. Some mountains are too much to climb with natural stamina, or some areas are too hot or cold to traverse without the proper protection. Rather than a series of tunics there's proper mix-and-match armour sets with stats and status buffs, and on top of that cooking can provide significant buffs. Both of these encourage you to explore: you might find valuable new gear in shrines, or cash to buy said gear, and ingredients for cooking up new recipes to provide new buffs are absolutely everywhere. The moment when you don't have another thing on your personal check-list of things to do in Breath of the Wild is rare, because there's always something new on the horizon you can tackle. Even the story is mostly delivered by optional flashbacks - and even these are located by exploring various important places from Link and Zelda's past. Everything links back into this desire to get you exploring - shrines, cooking, weapon durability, armour and other gear.\"It's impressively dense not just in terms of world size and the content within it but also in terms of how those elements interact with each other.\"Part of what makes this possible is that Breath of the Wild does away with the traditional game-long smattering of items and simply drops every single item needed to actually complete the game into your lap in the first hour. In Zelda terms there are five traditional items - a glider, bombs, a magnet that can be used to pick up metal objects, a freeze beam that can make platforms out of ice, and stasis, a power that freezes things in place and allows you to store kinetic energy in them to send them flying no matter their weight. There's also four powerful special powers unlocked by finishing each dungeon - but like the dungeons themselves these are optional and simply help to take some of the pressure off. This might not sound like much, but Breath of the Wild does a fine job using these items as a basis for all its puzzles. Some one-shot mechanics such as electricity and physics puzzles show up a fair bit too, but this smattering of items proves to be incredibly useful. Each has far more utility than many past Zelda items - they avoid that problem of Twilight Princess' Spinner item, which is amazing for an hour and then never useful again. On top of that many classic Zelda items such as magic rods and wands and boomerangs show up as regular weapons, complete with their unique properties. \n \nWhere Breath of the Wild impresses most and feels most Nintendo is in how many of its systems merge and work together. This might be something simple such as placing a bomb and then using a deku/korok leaf to create gusts of wind to blow it towards enemies, or it might be how if you chop a tree down in the right way you can make a makeshift raft from the trunk to float downstream. This version of Hyrule is in itself a puzzle, with the game constantly asking you to set yourself a new destination and find an exciting way to get there. Along the way you might find an enemy camp, some Koroks, perhaps even a Great Fairy Fountain - they're all around, hidden away.This is where the game is most special; it's impressively dense not just in terms of world size and the content within it but also in terms of how those elements interact with each other. NPCs have Majora's Mask style schedules they adhere to, but those schedules are also altered by the random changes in weather. Rain will send people running and change their dialogue, while sun might make people stop chopping wood and relax a while. Items can often be combined in unexpected ways, and the game has many little logic rules of its own that end up adding up to something rather special. Need a boost? Lighting grass on fire creates an updraft of hot air you can ride with your paraglider. You could set that fire any number of ways - a torch, a fire rod, fire arrows, flint and wood, or even just a lucky strike of lightning. One piece of loot from Octoroks basically functions as a balloon - imagine the things you could attach that to! Rain serves to dampen your footsteps if you're going for a stealthy approach - and pretty much every major mechanic has armour, food or both to buff its use as well. The few frustrations I had such as a few obscure puzzle solutions and some fairly weak boss encounters inside dungeons are more than outstripped by the positive. Figuring out new ways to use the items, systems and powers the game gives you together often makes you feel like an absolute genius and almost always leaves you grinning wildly like an idiot. These are the kinds of feelings I love most in games.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86d222cf-d259-465d-9538-c510125f5c35": {"__data__": {"id_": "86d222cf-d259-465d-9538-c510125f5c35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "29d003cb-3dde-4d64-89ee-01216ee87415", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf6e57718c57af3d1ce3c9988d26e61b215fdb3e81c5bbccb90e813fe16fa10e"}, "3": {"node_id": "af7607e2-9435-48c1-878f-a1702d8c2621", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "79d7e9e326b25dfa919a52dd4952116030e486178f778fce52640db6993fe9b0"}}, "hash": "445a58402d9784ba0ed969f3fd2a325ed79e6008da0e3f53d4081e45592eb703", "text": "These are the kinds of feelings I love most in games. \n \n\"Polished to a ludicrous degree, this is a different kind of game but still one that gives Ocarina of Time a run for its money.\"This brilliant open world is wrapped in a decent story that, as mentioned earlier, is largely optional. One way Nintendo appears to have skirted around the issue of not wanting to stop the player projecting themselves into Link is to make it easy to divorce yourself from the story and, weirdly, by simplifying it. Acted much of it may be, but Breath of the Wild's narrative is simpler than Skyward Sword, with its antagonist a snarling evil beast who is just inherently evil - motivation isn't a worry. The voice work is pretty standard Nintendo stuff, cartoon-like as it is in Fire Emblem and Kid Icarus, but the text translation is remarkably well-done, which helps that along. I also think it's a fun take on the Zelda lore that deliberately distances itself from much of the tangled lore for something of a fresh start - it works.The game is a looker in spite of the Switch (where we tested) obviously not being as powerful as the other major machines - Nintendo has that insane secret sauce that means so many of their games look excellent on the strength of their art design alone. Breath of the Wild follows that trend. The game struggles to maintain its frame rate in intense situations - a heavy assault on a packed enemy base in the rain with arrows and spells flying might make it choke a bit, for instance - but on Switch at least this is rare enough to not concern.Breath of the Wild is special. Ocarina of Time is of course that earth-shattering, industry-changing high bar to meet, and it's worth saying that this is a different kind of game. Where Ocarina of Time (and Mario 64) had to reinvent and redefine genres, Breath of the Wild doesn't aim to do that. Instead it takes ideas we've seen before both in Zelda and elsewhere and mixes them together, aiming to deliver them in a better way than we've seen before.Your jaw isn't going to drop in that Ocarina sense, but you are going to smile a lot. Hours are going to simply melt away. Polished to a ludicrous degree, this is a different kind of game but still one that gives Ocarina of Time a run for its money. After Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, which I found formulaic and awful in turn, it's quite a stunning change.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is, without a doubt, one of the best games of the last decade.

A movie made 60 years ago, even if it\u2019s not a particularly well-made movie, can be just as enjoyable today as it was when it first hit theaters. There are many video games from my childhood in the \u201980s and early \u201990s that I absolutely loved, but can\u2019t push myself to play today because issues I could ignore or missed as an adolescent today stand out like a sore thumb.The Legend of Zelda is not one of those games. When it was released it changed gaming, and when I finally got to play it at five years old, it changed me and started a lifelong love affair with interactive entertainment. So well crafted, so forward thinking, the NES masterpiece is just as playable today, 30 years later, as it was when it was first released. Something tells me 30 years from now, when I\u2019m 61, I\u2019ll be saying the same thing about The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo Switch, Wii U [reviewed]) Developer: Nintendo\u00a0 Publisher: Nintendo\u00a0 Released: March 3, 2017\u00a0 MSRP: $59.99To judge The Legend of Zelda: The Breath of the Wild solely against previous entries would be a disservice to the entire series.

In Breath, Zelda and the Calamity Ganon have been trapped in a 100-year battle at Hyrule Castle. The surrounding towns and villages were destroyed, their charred remnants scattered across the land as reminders of what has been lost. Link, gravely wounded in the fight, was taken to a restoration chamber, waking 100 years later with no memory of what transpired. Your overall goal is obviously to beat Ganon and save Zelda, but the road to the final confrontation will be paved by your actions and your decisions.It\u2019s quite well known at this point that Breath of the Wild features an open-world design. Spending 54 hours in it, it\u2019s one of the most open worlds I\u2019ve ever experienced, reminding me very much of an MMO with all the level restrictions removed. Once you finish with The Old Man at The Great Plateau, you\u2019re free to go in any direction you want, conquering the game as you please. For me, that meant running around discovering all of the Shiekah Shrines I could. These puzzle and combat trials, built centuries ago, offered many wonderful opportunities to use the Shiekah Slate.Obviously inspired by the Wii U GamePad in the same way the Tingle Tuner was obviously a Game Boy Advance, the Shiekah Slate is as close to a classic Zelda item you\u2019ll find here. Using it, you can take pictures, create bombs, whip up blocks of ice, manipulate metallic pieces, and freeze time on an object, allowing you to strike it repeatedly with your weapon to send it flying. While early Shrines point to just a few options for the device in puzzle solving, the real-world applications of it proved to be quite versatile. Beyond uncovering secrets, I found many different ways to use the slate to my advantage. Ice blocks could serve as a quick bridge or shield, stopping time on a massive slab of rock let me jettison it right into an enemy encampment, and I was able to use the magnetic feature to steal weapons before the enemies could grab them. Plus bombs, which are perfect for making things go boom.The depth at which I used the Shiekah Slate is great, but I feel an even more important change in design direction is how this game isn\u2019t setting you up to succeed. Past Zelda games, with their linear progression, have always prepared you for the fight you have ahead. You were given the right tools at the right times and the land was littered with bombs, arrows, and enough rupees to fill any size wallet. In Breath of the Wild, you\u2019re destined to fail unless you go out of your way to find the supplies you need. Foraging for food because there are no heart pieces, stealing weapons off of enemies because yours are close to breaking, cooking up dishes because there\u2019s no easy-access potion shop \u2013 success isn\u2019t handed to Link, he and you have to earn it.That was a fact that took me many, many hours to figure out for myself. I spent too much playing this game as if it were every other Zelda game, even though all the signs were telling me to do otherwise. It wasn\u2019t until I died for what felt like the 50th time fighting my second dungeon boss that I realized I had to change how I played. Like John Rambo in First Blood, I had to actively prepare for the fight to come and while a montage of me gathering fruit and cooking bugs wouldn\u2019t pack the same punch as watching Sylvester Stallone assemble spear traps that make you wince in pain at the thought of them, that careful and time-consuming effort paid off just the same.With all that planning, I was finally able to challenge the dungeon bosses with confidence. Unless there are some hidden in a remote part of Hyrule, Breath of the Wild has only a handful of dungeons. They\u2019re almost purely puzzle-based, meaning you can conquer them in any order you like. Activating every switch in the dungeons required me to put my thinking cap on, and with a healthy amount of experimenting, I was able to unlock the keys to each one and make my way to the boss battle. With no dungeon-specific items to collect, these boss battles, one of which was aggravatingly difficult, tried my combat skills like no other.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4865ef97-1574-46ba-8ca2-6eb45a88fb1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4865ef97-1574-46ba-8ca2-6eb45a88fb1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "f58cef6b-0426-4e8b-87d2-c6c08f597c63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c31642e342fe2105dd64a4a788664d1155337bebaf87f52cbb88f4eb8dd811c4"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c996186-5ce3-438f-99c2-7025a28347be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "14f78e524feda2e3bc9f23b5b628178eae01dc0855697ee86bb923b93506e799"}}, "hash": "20ef48fca71e94d08b6988568f7a0b8a6c9c98c8451bd448a295ede47a0a4aa0", "text": "There were patterns I could follow, yes, but actually defeating them required lighting-quick reflexes, thorough competency in the controls, and extensive planning, including making sure I had enough weapons to defeat them.Weapons break and they break often. Some didn\u2019t last a single encounter and there have been times I had to cycle through three different melee tools to defeat one enemy. I\u2019ve been annoyed by breakable weapons in the past, but here I never reached a point where I became disgusted by the concept. Replacement weapons are easily available and, with the Shiekah Slate and stealth skills, I could easily steal swords and clubs before Bokoblins had a chance to use them on me.There\u2019s a nice variety in the weapons too. Sword and shield combos, two-handed spears that are ideal for mounted combat, clubs of all sizes, and boomerangs that could be used as a short sword and a projectile that returns to you. The further I went in the game, the more durable weapons I came across, eventually ending up with the Master Sword. If the game were less generous with new weapons, the fragility of my armaments would have been an issue.Now, this review may sound like I\u2019m just full of endless admiration for the game, oblivious to the issues found within, but it\u2019s easy for me to admit it\u2019s not without its flaws. The framerate can actually stutter to a stop, inventory management could be less cumbersome, I encountered a few instances of overlapping dialog in the cutscenes, it takes an unusually long time to come out of the home menu \u2013 which might be a feature and not a bug \u2013 and it quickly became annoying to stop the action every time the Blood Moon returned my fallen foes to the world of the living. There\u2019s also the fact that outside of off-TV play, there are no GamePad-exclusive features.I get those concerns exist, I just don\u2019t really care. Not one of them dampened my enjoyment of this title in any way or took away from the pure joy of picking a direction and just going. The topography of Hyrule is so thoughtfully littered with points of interest, its siren song seducing me to each tower, to each shrine, to each interesting rock formation that actually turned out to be a puzzle. The sense of discovery here is like nothing I\u2019ve felt in a long, long time.There is no other way to put this: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is brilliant. It is magnificent. It is marvelous, amazing, fantastic, and every other synonym for the word wonderful that can be found in the thesaurus. If The Legend of Zelda was the flint that ignited the passion I have for video gaming, Breath of the Wild is the 500lb bag of charcoal that will keep that fire burning for decades to come.[This review is based on a retail build of the game purchased by the reviewer.]Essential10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre.

Originally Wind Waker\u00a0was going to feature a traditional \u201crealistic\u201d art style, but the creators got worried that in the increasingly competitive market they wouldn\u2019t stand out \u2014 so Toon Link was born.It sold well but many fans reacted negatively to it at the time, causing them to shift back into realism with\u00a0Twilight Princess, which, subsequently, people also didn\u2019t like, having finally come around to Wind Waker.To some degree Skyward Sword tried to marry the two styles, but\u00a0The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild rights so many of the wrongs that game committed.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u00a0(Switch [reviewed], Wii U) Developer: Nintendo Publisher: Nintendo Released:\u00a0March 3, 2017 MSRP: $59.99My relationship with the Zelda\u00a0series is public record. The original was one of my first adventure games outside of Dragon Warrior, and subsequently, each release has bookended a specific point of my life. Yet, I don\u2019t care for a number of games in the franchise, especially the last two mainline Zeldas: Link Between Worlds\u00a0and Skyward Sword. It\u2019s a weird relationship, I know, and it\u2019s why I was so surprised that Breath of the Wild\u00a0walks back a lot of the boring or bad strides respectively that the series has made lately.There\u2019s a much bigger emphasis on your emotional connection to the world of Wild. It embraces the timeline theory without being held hostage to it, or being too tongue-in-cheek and meta about it. Wild\u00a0has some depressing moments that fit and accent the level of desperation that usually comes with being the Hero of Hyrule. Voice acting assists this emotional angle, and no, it\u2019s not overdone. There\u2019s still plenty of \u201chooos\u201d and \u201chaaahs,\u201d when speaking to NPCs \u2014 that adorable gibberish talk is alive and well. Thematically, the effort to turn it into a far future-type\u00a0Zelda\u00a0while still remaining true to the adventurous medieval roots is admirable.As more threads start to unravel, the narrative never feels overbearing and doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome. I can\u2019t tell you how many times other games have done this, where it feels like I\u2019m stuck in one boring town or area while folks barricade the gate and yell \u201cyou can\u2019t leave yet, your business isn\u2019t finished!\u201d Which leads me to Breath of the Wild\u2018s most paramount virtue: freedom. While the first hour (or much less if you know what you\u2019re doing) is technically a tutorial zone\u00a0of sorts, you\u2019re given a gigantic land mass to play around in, where the game proceeds to hand out most of your abilities \u2014 then sends you on your merry way to the true open world with no strings attached. It\u00a0beats the crap out of wrestling farm animals for an hour.Wait, what? Most of your abilities? Yep. I know what you\u2019re thinking. \u201cWhat about the tried-and-true Zelda\u00a0formula where you enter [x] dungeon and get [x] item?!\u201d Well, that\u2019s thankfully gone, as much as I\u2019ve enjoyed it in the past. A Link Between Worlds\u00a0dabbled in this concept with item renting, but Breath of the Wild\u00a0blows the doors off that idea with an amplifier that goes to 11, jumps off the stage, and crowd surfs.\u00a0You do accrue [mostly combat] spells of sorts from clearing each core dungeon (there\u2019s four, with an optional fifth that grants no powers), but for the most part, you\u2019re equipped with the following Runes \u2014 two different kinds of bombs (round and cubed), a glider, stasis, a giant magnet, a camera, an amiibo summoner, and a spell that creates blocks of ice in water \u2014 all governed by a cooldown timer.While I won\u2019t spoil how all of these spells work, suffice to say there are multiple uses for them, and new scenarios that Breath of the Wild\u00a0keeps chucking at you at a rapid pace. Even if you think you know how bombs have worked (or have always operated within the confines of the series), there\u2019s usually a surprise waiting for you at the next shrine (read: small challenge rooms littered about the overworld). Initially, I felt underwhelmed that Nintendo went this route.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bba040c-1d91-49c2-ae98-bde7fae315d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bba040c-1d91-49c2-ae98-bde7fae315d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c996186-5ce3-438f-99c2-7025a28347be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "14f78e524feda2e3bc9f23b5b628178eae01dc0855697ee86bb923b93506e799"}, "3": {"node_id": "d8562c01-babb-4d3f-a15d-d93e029adc99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4378401c8463c430d7ce4fadda83070f3d263df988750301f5b3d5bdbeed1b8"}}, "hash": "6e0793ca7743e29c6340683d196860f77e5486beb523990e79d6e0b2c507f746", "text": "Initially, I felt underwhelmed that Nintendo went this route. I kept thinking that I had missed a few abilities early on, as I would enter shrines and have no conceivable way of completing them. But I was wrong.Hours later I entered my first dungeon, and was able to use an item I had picked up in the first 15 minutes to solve a puzzle in a way I didn\u2019t even think to try previously. I went back to that pesky shrine and cleared it with a smile on my face. This is how open world games should work. Not with and overabundance of checklists and millions of map icons to clear for achievement points \u2014 but with a design that feels legitimately interconnected and fluid in an all-encompassing way.Breath of the Wild\u00a0isn\u2019t just\u00a0\u201copen\u201d in the sense that you can roam around. It has more RPG elements than any game in the series, with a litany of gear and items to find. The scale is so massive that over 60 hours in, I\u2019m still discovering new ingredients to cook with items I\u2019ve never seen before. With a dedicated\u00a0jump button (hi Adventure of Link) you can climb up just about any mountain and leap off the top (one of my favorite pastimes). Seeing fast travel and radio towers come to a Nintendo game is a little weird, but they own it, and naturally, are host to their own little puzzles. Nothing, even the few borrowed concepts, are half-measures.It\u2019s hard to convey just how free Breath of the Wild\u00a0feels on paper. Once I spent half an hour chopping down trees, and I had no idea what I could even use the wood for. I pulled out a real pen and paper and jotted down recipes I had discovered, and experimented for another 30 minutes to find the perfect concoction. I pulled up the in-game map and stamped areas I wanted to return to later, even if they weren\u2019t hosting any specific quest or reward. Many times I entered an area by way of an alternative puzzle solution, and not the primary method the designers perhaps intended for me.The dungeons, which I suspect will be a point of contention from folks who want everything to stay the same (I can see the thinkpieces in my head), also encapsulate this philosophy. They\u2019re much more compact, and are almost exclusively based on puzzle-solving outside of the final encounter. There\u2019s no \u201cbide time until you get [the hookshot] and then use it to solve every puzzle the rest of the dungeon\u201d formula \u2014 you\u2019re using everything you picked up at the start, which includes the aforementioned multi-use array of puzzle-solving tools.Fi isn\u2019t there to ruin the solution. There\u2019s no forced tutorial section directly after you defeat a miniboss and pick up the new \u201cdungeon item.\u201d The dungeons feel like an extension of the open world itself, as do the shrines. Everything funnels back into every other aspect of Breath of the Wild in a deliberate fashion. You aren\u2019t just earning new Heart Containers or pieces of loot, you\u2019re acquiring knowledge. By the end of the game I felt like a superhero, and traveled across the world in search of shrines to complete.A world, mind, that\u2019s mostly stable. There are some framerate drops, even on TV mode, in several areas. I have a feeling people are going to be up in arms about it, but for me it didn\u2019t occur often enough to truly have an impact on my fun. That\u2019s because I care more about the draw distance honestly, which is so well done that it hits that chord of \u201cI see that place in the distance, and want to go there\u201d more than any game I\u2019ve ever played. While towers are usually just throwaway bits that unlock more map icons, I would frequently revisit them just to scout for new places to explore for the heck of it.Combat is also simple enough where you aren\u2019t worrying about iFrames or precise rolling, so the occasional dip isn\u2019t as crippling as, say, a pure action game. Motion controls for projectile aiming are also incredibly precise, and best of all \u2014 optional. There\u2019s some semblance of the advancements made on the Wii and Wii U, but they\u2019re not forced. I love it! I thought I would hate juggling items with the new durability system, but it\u2019s fun to try all the different types of weapons.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8562c01-babb-4d3f-a15d-d93e029adc99": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8562c01-babb-4d3f-a15d-d93e029adc99", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bba040c-1d91-49c2-ae98-bde7fae315d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e0793ca7743e29c6340683d196860f77e5486beb523990e79d6e0b2c507f746"}, "3": {"node_id": "46da780c-e0ea-4b92-ad2a-f5beec2394fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4791e7ca5aa3f4ab5f4a455d116f54abc97cd8940c3c97e0b2d1b64a9dc85f3"}}, "hash": "e4378401c8463c430d7ce4fadda83070f3d263df988750301f5b3d5bdbeed1b8", "text": "Much like the game\u2019s puzzles you can approach combat in multiple ways, with stealth or item-based solutions, and the choice to wield an axe, staff, one-handed sword, magic wand, boomerang, or a bow play into that.I thought the Joy-Con Grip (which is basically two Joy-Con controllers slotted together) would feel underwhelming too, but I got used to it in less than an hour. Equipment selection is handled with the sectioned d-pad like C-Buttons, and the motion controls work great. As an aside I did not have access to a Pro Controller for this review, but will have one going forward after I buy one when the game officially launches.By the time the credits rolled (and I was back outside of the final fight with a star next to my save file, New Game+ style), I was about 40 hours deep. But there\u2019s over 100 shrines to find, several superbosses to fight, hidden gear to locate, and optional mini-questlines, so I\u2019m going to be busy for a while longer. Speaking of extras \u2014 in case you\u2019re wondering, the amiibo support is mostly harmless. You get some extra items you can otherwise find in the game, or some Easter egg type stuff that isn\u2019t overpowered (you can find armor in the first few hours that is better than most of the figure boosts). The Wolf Link companion does feel like a massive thing in the form of a bite-sized paid piece of DLC, but I don\u2019t feel like it was necessarily \u201ccut.\u201d A massive 100 hour or more adventure makes this choice easier to digest. If the figures were scarce I\u2019d be angry, but they\u2019re widely available.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u00a0has very little wrong with it. There\u2019s the occasional framerate drop, a short stealth sequence, another short escort bit, and a few bosses that are fine, but aren\u2019t as memorable as they should be. They\u2019re going to be the main talking points as folks break the game down over the course of the next year (and decade). But those moments were quickly erased from my mind given the rapid-fire pacing and promise of returning to the sprawling universe. I flipped dungeons 360 degrees and walked on their ceilings, and never once was frustrated. I found an island where a deity stripped me of my items and challenged me to solve various riddles so I could get my gear back. I fought optional world bosses, explored labyrinths far off the beaten path, and gradually learned how to tame horses \u2014 none of which are handed to you on a silver platter.This isn\u2019t your typical boiler plate open world cash grab, rife with to-do lists and busywork. Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u00a0is an evolution of the formula for both eastern and western philosophies alike, and a new blueprint.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]Essential10s aren't perfect, since nothing is, but they come as close as you could get in a given genre.

The shrine sits on the brink of a high precipice. I saw it from a distance and fought my way there, just because I could.Now I'm trudging up a narrow ravine, following an ox I've startled, when suddenly a bokoblin on a horse wielding a spear comes charging over the rim toward me. Startled, I draw my bow and take a shot, miss and he's upon me. I whip out my blade and knock the monster from his mount, making short work of my opponent before hopping onto his horse and riding out onto the field on the other side, where another mounted bokoblin waits.I switch weapons to a spear---longer reach works better on horseback---and a joust ensues.Soon after, wide grassy plains give way to a rainswept jungle. I explore, aimless and in no hurry to get anywhere, surrounded by high palms. Waterfalls cascade all around. Bananas hang from low branches. Then suddenly, emerging from one of the myriad pools around me is a vast dragon, so long that by the time its head plunges into a distant lake, its tail is only just emerging from the pond.(Credit: Nintendo)I leap off a high ledge and paraglide down, glimpsing a distant stable below. Here I land and begin conversing with the locals, who tell me stories of the surrounding area, dropping little hints and clues about where I might want to go next. Maybe I'll follow those, or maybe I'll just...do something else.You can go anywhere and do anything in\u00a0The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\u00a0You might not be ready for what you find, but there's nothing stopping you from trying. You might discover along the way that you need better provisions---outfits that ward against heat or cold, for instance, or potions and meals that do the same. Some powers you find later into the game may help you traverse the world more easily or quickly, but after the game's opening segment, there's nothing gating you off from exploring every last inch of the massive world spread out before you. That distant shrine overlooking the sea? Go there. The only question is how best to make your journey. That lava-spewing volcano in the distance? Better dress appropriately, or at least find some fire elixirs. Fortunately, if you talk to everyone and do the little tasks asked of you, you'll probably find a fire elixir or two along the way. Or you can just make one yourself.The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild\u00a0isn't just the best\u00a0Zelda\u00a0game I've ever played. It's one of the best video games I've ever played. Period. It's unflinchingly ambitious and tirelessly innovative, and yet it feels like the natural culmination of decades of game design experience rolled into one big, awe-inspiring experience. That it borrows from so many other open-world games, from\u00a0Far Cry\u00a0to\u00a0Skyrim\u00a0doesn't change the fact: What Nintendo has done here is something incredibly special.(Credit: Nintendo)The entire world of\u00a0Breath of the Wild\u00a0is a carefully crafted, carefully designed open-world puzzle. The shrines and dungeons that you encounter offer their own more distilled and focused puzzles, each with its own creative twist, but the world itself is not just open for openness' sake. You don't simply trudge across big open spaces. Everywhere you go there's something to explore, some incredible discovery to make. There's a story here, of course, which you uncover as you play in a totally open-ended, non-linear fashion. But the backdrop to that story is your own adventure, and Nintendo uses organic, emergent storytelling in one of the most effective ways I've ever seen in a game. The stories you tell your friends about this game will be your own, unique and fascinating and sometimes funny, too.There's the time I found a massive ogre of some sort sleeping in a bog, and left him alone for fear he'd crush me. Later, I found another one, far below a giant hole in the ground and avoided him, too. Then I let my son play for a few minutes and he stumbled across a third. The massive beast was sleeping atop a huge mound, surrounded by smaller minions. It took me a few harrowing tries, but I finally brought the monster down and took his treasure, which was half-buried in the dirt.Or the many times I solved ridiculously challenging Shrine puzzles thanks to a moment of genius (or happy accident!) or clever suggestion from my 6-year-old.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cda7ef1-8abc-41ee-b071-b3ff693314f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cda7ef1-8abc-41ee-b071-b3ff693314f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "46da780c-e0ea-4b92-ad2a-f5beec2394fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e4791e7ca5aa3f4ab5f4a455d116f54abc97cd8940c3c97e0b2d1b64a9dc85f3"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb46aa60-77e0-420b-8a4d-504ece510c7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a9b32369996162fd472af4b0930bf1ecfafe20e1c7d42871f99fdf53792b9f9"}}, "hash": "c9e9efbe75936675ea56bc1db92652fe3f9eb7c9d7ede604408dc00e99210c4d", "text": "or clever suggestion from my 6-year-old.

Then you hop into the air and glide in one direction or another. It doesn't really matter which way you go, something will be there waiting to be discovered. Oh and look, a falling star. Let's go see where it landed.The first time I was struck by lightning in\u00a0Breath of the Wild, I didn't realize that it was because I had metal items equipped. Before it struck me, I watched as lightning smashed into the landscape around me, grass and trees igniting into gouts of flame. Rain makes walls too slick to climb. One tower I climbed up was so high, it was freezing up top and I had to either drink a potion to keep me warm or leap off and move on. These experiences constantly confront and astound throughout the game, and you find yourself falling into a rhythm that's almost hard to describe. In spite of whatever influences\u00a0Breath of the Wild\u00a0wears on its sleeve, there's truly no other game like it.(Watch some of my gameplay footage in the video below.)The BasicsThe cycle continues in\u00a0Breath of the Wild.\u00a0You play as the ancient hero Link, out on a quest to stop Calamity Ganon and rescue the Princess Zelda. Only this time around, you aren't immediately stuck in a long tutorial. The world isn't gated off in innumerable ways. You begin on a Great Plateau where you learn that you've been asleep for 100 years. A strange old man helps you fill your Sheikah Slate with the tools you need to accomplish your quest: two recharging bombs (one round and one cube), a magentic power, a time/motion stopping stasis power and a power that lets you change water into ice. These powers, along with your ability to climb, swing blades and shoot a bow and arrow will be just about everything you need to solve every puzzle, navigate every dungeon, and travel to any point on the vast map ahead of you. Many other tools, items, weapons and so forth will aid you along your way, but these basics are all you need.Then you set out, journeying whichever direction you please, uncovering secrets along the way, meeting strangers on the road and at stables and villages, slowly unlocking the mystery of your past and Zelda's story, and moving ever closer to your quest. Depending on which way you set out in the beginning of the game, your quest and mine may play out in wholly different ways. No other open-world game, including a masterpiece like\u00a0The Witcher 3, has been so free-roaming and organic, let alone as carefully designed and hand-crafted.You have a stamina wheel that depletes when climbing, running or gliding, and the normal hearts that serve as hit points. There's also a hot/cold meter that warns if you're reaching unsustainable temperatures. Various other special powers and systems come into play as you progress in the game, though I won't spoil any of them. There's a way to expand inventory, too, which is nice and offers up its own set of mini-puzzles.(Credit: Nintendo)Read More:\u00a0The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Makes Climbing Fun AgainLink has a variety of weapons at his disposal, and you constantly find new swords, axes, spears, bows and shields, all with their own power rating, durability and some with special powers like fire or lightning. You'll also find various outfits (or buy them from merchants) that can do different things, some with incredible powers that help you progress further in the game. You can boost stats on these if you find the right NPCs, and you can dye them, adding some basic aesthetic customization to the game.One of my biggest complaints about open-world games is that they almost always sacrifice a sense of mission design in favor of generic openness. That is not the case here. I've never played an open world game like this before, as though countless levels have been seamlessly woven together. Perhaps the closest thing is\u00a0Dark Souls, though it is less strictly open-world. Both games buck the trend of openness for its own sake, though\u00a0Souls gates off areas until you progress to a certain point.Really, the original\u00a0Dark Souls\u00a0was the last time I felt so in awe of a video game.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb46aa60-77e0-420b-8a4d-504ece510c7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb46aa60-77e0-420b-8a4d-504ece510c7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "8cda7ef1-8abc-41ee-b071-b3ff693314f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9e9efbe75936675ea56bc1db92652fe3f9eb7c9d7ede604408dc00e99210c4d"}, "3": {"node_id": "1982f0d1-83b7-426f-b67a-e284dbba697c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e53173dc8b5c37a596f33743e1570d8bfb1fb33b7560872deb81f6945d888f01"}}, "hash": "7a9b32369996162fd472af4b0930bf1ecfafe20e1c7d42871f99fdf53792b9f9", "text": "Breath of the Wild\u00a0stands shoulder to shoulder with that game as a modern masterpiece of game design and both sit in the pantheon of my all-time favorite games.(Credit: Nintendo)IssuesI'm done gushing for a little while. Despite being a modern-day video game masterpiece, Breath of the Wild\u00a0is not without its flaws.(Credit: Nintendo)These are all issues that I've had with the game, but none of them are particularly distracting and none really detracts from the overall experience. Picking up items and plants and what-not is very quick, for instance. You don't have to kneel down and harvest stuff like in many other games. You just press a button and it goes into your inventory. Weapons break, but nearly every enemy drops one when they go down. Really, the only actual thing that I find disappointing about the game is the frame-rate issues, and that, I think, really speaks to Nintendo's decision making on the Switch side. I love the new console, but there's no denying it could be a little more powerful. Certainly a huge, complex game like\u00a0Breath of the Wild\u00a0could make great use of a stronger system.On the other hand, it's quite wonderful to be able to play the game on the go, utilizing the Switch's handheld mode. The game looks fantastic on the Switch's tablet screen, and it's just amazing to be able to play it on the TV and then pop it out and take it with you anywhere you please.VerdictI give the game a resounding\u00a0Buy on my Buy/Hold/Sell scale. It's one of the best video games I've ever played, and is sure to keep you busy for many hours, days and weeks, exploring this vast, beautiful, unexpected world. I can't speak to the Wii U version, but I'm sure either version will delight and inspire. Don't miss this one, even if you're not a fan of older Zelda games. New fans and old fans alike will find so much to love in this game.(Credit: Nintendo)In a lot of ways, it's really just a game you have to experience for yourself. I'll have a lot more to say about\u00a0Breath of the Wild,\u00a0as well as some videos to post on my YouTube channel and here, so stay tuned. I really can't wait for all of you to play it, and for us to trade stories.

See what makes The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild an instant classic in our reviewThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\u00a0is one of the best games I've ever played. It adds the expansive feeling of The Elder Scrolls series with that Nintendo\u00a0magic to make an entirely engrossing experience. Breath of the Wild is the first significant move forward for the Zelda franchise in years, and the changes are comparable to those between A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time.I had feared that Nintendo had rushed Breath of the Wild to market so it could debut as a Nintendo Switch\u00a0launch title. However, I've found my worries to be unfounded, at least for the Nintendo Switch version. I haven't had the opportunity to play the Wii U version of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild yet, so any technical claims made in this review only apply to the Nintendo Switch version of the game.Nintendo has been increasingly ambitious with its star franchises lately, and has\u00a0taken risks that would have been uncharacteristic in the past. Zelda games, in particular, have stuck to a formula proven by the original title way back in 1986. While the 18 main series titles in the Zelda franchise have differed in setting, style, and story, they've all shared a linear primary plotline experience. Previously in Zelda, you'd tackle a series of dungeons in order and gain the power you needed to defeat Ganon (or another stand-in villain).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1982f0d1-83b7-426f-b67a-e284dbba697c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1982f0d1-83b7-426f-b67a-e284dbba697c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb46aa60-77e0-420b-8a4d-504ece510c7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7a9b32369996162fd472af4b0930bf1ecfafe20e1c7d42871f99fdf53792b9f9"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb9dbf0f-2147-43ab-a3bb-2607e67b83df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db9dcf77fd6e0dbabf9c45f72c88fc4803a2db1ed72a5a02dda22f6a58c2d858"}}, "hash": "e53173dc8b5c37a596f33743e1570d8bfb1fb33b7560872deb81f6945d888f01", "text": "However, Breath of the Wild does away with linear gameplay for a much more open-ended narrative.Instead of having to attempt dungeons in order, you're given the choice to tackle quests in the order you choose. You're not locked into any one way to experience The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Your journey will most likely follow an entirely different order than mine, and you can choose to explore the whole of Hyrule or beeline straight towards the conclusion of the game.This openness of narrative does come at a price, though. It's incredibly difficult\u00a0to figure out everything there is to do in Breath of the Wild. You're given free reign of Link's destiny shortly after beginning the game after a small introduction area. You're told about some key objectives that are located in Hyrule, including the over 100 optional shrines that in-part take the place of traditional Zelda dungeons, and sent on your way.The lack of hand-holding\u00a0makes Breath of the Wild a title that requires a high degree of\u00a0self-motivation. There are few waypoints in the game, and even with the main quests, you're given a general clue as to what you need to accomplish. If you're not mindful, you can get lost in this Zelda, and it is not difficult at all to completely lose track of what and where your next objective is. Hyrule is huge in scope, and Link's new abilities to climb virtually any surface and glide across huge distances make it all too easy to get stuck somewhere you don't want to be. For some, this will be disorienting, and for others, it will be exhilarating. It will depend on how much you enjoy exploration and open-ended gameplay.The open-ended nature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's gameplay lends itself to the unique capabilities of the Nintendo Switch in a way that previous Zelda titles wouldn't be able to. Because the main plot is compartmentalized into multiple episode-like quests, it's easy to play either in a traditional manner, with the Switch hooked up to a TV, or one the go with the Switch in portable mode. You can play Breath of the Wild for hours at a time, completing whole swaths of main or side quests, or only pick it up for a short thirty-minute gaming session without forgetting where you left off.Breath of the Wild is a massive game and can be at times overwhelming. However, it's not the kind of title you marathon through. Even now, after completing the entire main quest and exploring vast tracts of Hyrule, there's still plenty of side quests left for me to go back and finish and tons\u00a0of places I've not even set foot. Hyrule's vast spaces don't suffer from the same issue that many open-world games do, though. Each area is deliberately laid out and filled with unique locations to explore. Even though the main quest doesn't require you to explore nearly all of Hyrule's landmass, just looking at the map and finding an interesting looking place you've never been compels you to leave the beaten track and head off on your own adventure independently of any active motivation from the game.The Nintendo Switch is a great machine, but with a title as expansive and ambitious as Breath of the Wild, it has a hard time keeping up. It's too early to say that Zelda takes the Switch to its limits, but looking at the hardware specs I'm amazed that Nintendo was able to accomplish what it has. Breath of the Wild shows Nintendo's greatest strengths and unfortunately, its biggest weakness when compared to its rivals.Breath of the Wild is obviously well-optimized for the Switch hardware, which is a testament to Nintendo's internal programming prowess. However, I still experienced some performance issues. At times you'll run into slowdown, especially in areas with a lot of foliage and wildlife. There is also present the telltale gray haze in the distance which has been the tool of developers wishing to obscure far off land as to lessen needed draw distance. While this haze doesn't completely obscure the scenic vistas Zelda: Breath of the Wild has to offer, it does take away some of the magic of looking down on the lands of Hyrule from a tall mountain cliff.An odd quirk of the way the Nintendo Switch handles resolution leads to differing performance depending on whether the Switch is docked or in portable mode. The above issues are most apparent when the Switch is docked and outputting 900p resolution. When in portable mode, though, the Switch outputs 720p, which lessens the framerate issues and seems to produce a less blurry, more crisp picture.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb9dbf0f-2147-43ab-a3bb-2607e67b83df": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb9dbf0f-2147-43ab-a3bb-2607e67b83df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fe20d06f-ad8f-4edd-a415-70f94b6c60da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a17917cca6bdfb17eabaf843828270ecfd5d8155b1e0e72a8b74112c1ad80cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "1982f0d1-83b7-426f-b67a-e284dbba697c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e53173dc8b5c37a596f33743e1570d8bfb1fb33b7560872deb81f6945d888f01"}, "3": {"node_id": "27fd595e-6283-472e-8939-c44217d2ebbb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "21b8ace4f2534874c45e1c6906e55daad8d5487a03c760c6277a54ce87247a30"}}, "hash": "db9dcf77fd6e0dbabf9c45f72c88fc4803a2db1ed72a5a02dda22f6a58c2d858", "text": "Hopefully, in the future, Nintendo will add an option to output in 720p while docked, which I believe would help mitigate some of the performance issues I saw during my time with Breath of the Wild.Link's struggle against Calamity Ganon may be his hardest yet. The last few entries in the Zelda franchise wouldn't qualify as tough in my book, but gameplay changes in Breath of the Wild lead this one\u00a0to be highly challenging.Your\u00a0weapons no longer last forever, and you can't depend on any of your offensive or defensive equipment for long. Melee weapons, shields, and bows all have limited durability, and even the most robust weapon will eventually break. Because of the need to conserve powerful weapons for when you need them most, stealth plays a more crucial role in Breath of the Wild than any Zelda title before it. Sneaking past enemies is not only a valid option; most of the time it's the best one.Enemies themselves are much stronger than in previous titles as well. No longer can you cheese a particular enemy's weakness to an item and quickly kill them. Your foes still have unique vulnerabilities, but they're much less pronounced, and you'll hardly ever encounter lone enemies. Instead Boboblins, Moblins, Chuchus, Wizzrobes, and more, all coordinate their attacks against you in groups, and their increased strength relative to their previous incarnations can easily overwhelm, even once you've spent tens of hours improving your health and defensive capabilities.This increased difficulty in enemies makes each engagement feel much more vital, and each successful exploration of a new area that much more rewarding. The number of foes that can one-shot Link can be frustrating, but it drives you to keep exploring and looking for new ways to increase your chances of survival. It also makes the deep new cooking and elixir making systems take front and center, as you'll need the health restoring and buff bestowing items you can make to make it in the wilds of Hyrule.By avoiding the pitfalls, other open-world adventures have made too often, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild makes itself an instant classic. Instead of a generic, Zelda-themed clone of a Ubisoft or Elder Scrolls title, Nintendo has translated its unique know-how into a Zelda game that brings the franchise in line with current gaming trends. While no one would say that the classic Zelda formula was entirely\u00a0stale, it would have been disappointing not to see a significant progression with Breath of the Wild, especially with it being the flagship product of Nintendo's latest system.Though there are some technical issues with Breath of the Wild, they pale in comparison to the sense of wonder and adventure the title projects. By setting The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo\u00a0debuted with a system seller. If you're getting a Nintendo Switch, there's simply no question of what the best bang for your buck will be in the system's early days. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a game that is meant to be loved and savored for years to come, and I'm sure it will be looked back on with as much fanfare and admiration as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Nintendo's other hallmark titles.This review is based on a Nintendo Switch copy provided by the publisher. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be available in retail and digital stores on March 3, for $59.99.

Way to drag the pack down!I only sped read the review because I want to enter mostly impression-free, but did you knock it down from 10/10 because of the technical issues? Or because of how it's too easy to lose yourself in the world? I didn't really see any other criticisms at all.It must kind of suck being the only person to have played it around the office lol. I'd want to talk to everyone about it\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe technical limitations were enough of an impediment to knock it down to a 9/10.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tfair enough\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWow beyond excited, can't wait to get lost in this world!

Awesome, I can't wait to play it tonight on my Wii U.\r That sucks about the Switch dock mode issues, I wonder how the Wii U version will be, its probably locked at 720p.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tyou're getting it tonight?? I'm getting it tomorrow.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYes! I work till 3:30 am so I will download from the store tonight it will be up at  around 12:00!\r Cool, you getting digital or box copy?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOh nice at midnight, makes sense! I'm getting the physical copy. I am so excited!
